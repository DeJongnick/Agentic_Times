<p>The second <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has been worse than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a>’s worst nightmare. The largest military force in the history of the world, across a largely undefended border, is suddenly under the command of a president who has called for our annexation. Canada could not be less prepared. The possibility of American aggression has been so remote, for so long, that the idea has not been seriously considered in living memory. Donald Trump has focused on <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/04/trump-carney-canada-greenland-00325783">economic rather than military pressure</a>, but the new tone in Washington is finally forcing Canada to ask itself the most basic question: how do we defend ourselves?</p> <p>For most other countries in the world, self-defence is the key to national identity. Canada’s immense good fortune has been that we haven’t really needed a strong military to build our country. In the war of 1812, we were British, and the British kept us alive because we were British. There hasn’t been an attack on our homeland since. Confederation, the founding of the country, was the result of a political negotiation rather than a conquest or a violent independence movement. Our military was based on a fundamental assumption about our place in the world, and the nature of the world itself. Our place in the world was to contribute to the global order. The global order shared our fundamental values. Peacekeeping was more our style than defense.</p> <p>Recently, I’ve been working on <a href="https://shows.acast.com/gloves-off">Gloves Off</a>, a podcast about how Canada can protect itself from any threat emanating from the US, and from every other country in the world now that the US is no longer our protector and guardian. The consensus from military and security experts is that we would be “a snack”.</p> <p>It is far from unusual for countries sliding toward authoritarianism, such as the the United States, to use foreign engagements to justify the suspension of their own laws. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Trump</a> has already started trumping up crazy excuses for anti-Canadian sentiment – a supposed flow of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/31/trump-canada-tariffs-order">fentanyl</a> over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/trump-us-canada-border">border</a> and other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/canada-fentanyl-trump.html">nonsense</a>. His ambassador says Trump thinks our boycotts make us <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/hoekstra-canadians-mean-nasty-1.7590636">“nasty” to deal with</a>.</p> <p>So what does Canada need to do to develop the capacity to defend itself? </p> <p>The good news is that Canada’s new reality is far from unique. In fact, it’s the historical norm. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/finland">Finland</a> is a potential model for us. It has lived its entire existence next to a belligerent country that is either expanding imperially or collapsing dangerously. The Finns do not have nuclear weapons. They are only 5.5 million people, next to Russia’s 143 million.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>The period we are entering is a period of deep chaos. Any reliance on international institutions and their restoration is a false hope</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Finland’s strategy is whole society defence. Matti Pesu, a senior research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, and a reserve commander of an armoured personnel carrier, explained that whole society defence does not pretend to be able to overcome a potential Russian onslaught. “Power asymmetry is an absolutely essential factor in the Finnish security thinking,” he told me. “Given how much bigger Russia is, in order to thwart that potential threat, we need to mobilize broadly the resources available in society.”</p> <p>Because Finland is geared, throughout its national institutions, towards self-defence, its resistance to Russia is credible. The idea is not to match Russian military capacity, but to make the conquest of Finland not worth the trouble. “Full societal resources of a smaller nation can actually be enough to thwart the potential threat from a larger power because the costs for the larger power to invade could actually be much higher than the potential benefits it would gain from such an invasion,” Pesu explains. The more capable a country is of causing pain to occupiers, the less likely the occupation happens in the first place.</p> <p>Conscription is essential. The Finns can put a million soldiers in the field within 72 hours. But every facet of Finnish government, from the healthcare system to the national broadcaster, has a role in the security system, and knows its role in a possible military conflict. “A preparedness mindset permeates the whole society,” Pesu says. “From the state level all the way to an individual living somewhere in the country.”</p> <p>To rise to Finland’s level, Canada would need to reorchestrate its entire frame of reference. The prime minister, Mark Carney, has recently announced serious <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/09/canada-mark-carney-defence-spending-budget">boosts</a> to national military spending: 2% by the end of this year, rising to 5% at some point in the future. But the government has pushed its readiness targets back to 2032. And those are targets that align with our typical military practices: meeting our commitments to our alliances. That money sounds good on a theoretical level. But the Canadian military situation has not fundamentally altered. We have not reset our position.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/18/canada-trump-flood-zone">Canada said it would stand up to Trump. Instead, it’s taking cues from him | Shiri Pasternak and Dayna Nadine Scott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The period we are entering is a period of deep chaos, of the weakening of international institutions, of multiple, interlocked collapses. Any reliance on international institutions and their restoration is a false hope. If Canada is to remain a stable democracy, we will have to find the stability in ourselves. A whole society defence would bolster us against the chaos that threatens us from every side and from within. In an era of splintering society, conscription is a force of unification, what Pesu calls “a strong democratic linkage”. Canada is a big country, with huge geographical and demographic diversity. We are as vulnerable as any other society to the informational chaos that is overtaking the world, to the incipient breakdown. A whole society defence would be a massive force for unification. It would establish, to Canadians at least, that there are crises we are going to face and we need to face them collectively. The thing about a whole society defence is that it determines that you are living in a whole society, a society that <em>needs </em>defending.</p> <p>Canada has no history of needing to defend itself. In fact, not needing a military is baked into our national identity – and that creates a psychological bind. To preserve who we are, we have to overcome one of our oldest tendencies, one of our best tendencies: our peace-loving nature, our idea of our country as an escape from history rather than its perpetrator or victim.</p> <p>And that leads to a very scary question: what will be the crisis that makes us realize that we need whole society defence? Let us hope it won’t be Canada’s last.</p> <ul> <li><p>Stephen Marche lives in Toronto and is the author of The Next Civil War and On Writing and Failure</p></li> </ul>
