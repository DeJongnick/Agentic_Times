<h2><strong>Do You Have ADHD?</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>Conversations around attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder">ADHD</a>) feel more prevalent, as awareness and diagnoses have both increased in recent years. This programme says, in fact, that an estimated 2.6 million people in the UK have the condition. Dr Karan Rajan and Dr Clare Bailey Mosley take a deep dive into the subject, answering the most common questions and separating fact from fiction. Bailey Mosley even undergoes assessment herself. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2><strong>The Repair Shop</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>David was a dedicated beekeeper whose daughter, Ruth, from Nottinghamshire, commissioned a portrait of him with his bees, painted on concrete. He has since died and the painting is a little weather-worn. Can conservator Lucia Scalisi restore it for Ruth? It’s just one of the tasks in this week’s roundup of visits to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/mar/12/theres-a-real-joy-in-fixing-something-the-rise-of-the-repair-cafe">repair shop</a>. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>The Great British Sewing Bee</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>A nice change of pace this week as a celebration of the textile traditions of Korea brings with it a guest judge, designer Eudon Choi. Along with taekwondo outfits in the transformation challenge, there’s the chance to be inspired by two historical garments revived by modern Korean style: the jeogori and the cheollik. <em>Jack Seale</em></p>    <h2><strong>Pompeii: Life in the City With Dan Snow</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong><strong><br></strong>Dan Snow discovers graffiti of gladiators drawn by children 2,000 years ago as he continues to explore a current excavation at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/two-near-lifesize-sculptures-found-during-excavations-of-pompeii-tomb">Pompeii</a>. Co-tour guide Dr Kate Lister, meanwhile, finds a luxury villa, boasting three gardens and a private bath house. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>The Nazi Cartel</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Documentaries</strong><strong><br></strong>The gripping series revealing how an ex-Gestapo officer helped to shape Bolivia into being the world’s first narco-state continues. In 1980, undercover DEA agent Michael Levine is working to prevent the influential Suárez family from running cocaine into the US. But the Bolivian political landscape is about to violently change. Might a rival agency be involved? <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2><strong>Creature Commandos</strong></h2> <p><strong>10pm, Sky Max</strong><strong><br></strong>James Gunn’s oddball adult cartoon continues, with the origin story of Dr Phosphorus (Alan Tudyk) kicking off the penultimate episode. When that tale of bloody revenge is done with, the gang gather to prepare for a final showdown with Rostovic (Maria Bakalova). The snark and the story are artfully balanced. <em>JS</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>The Hundred Cricket, </strong><strong>London Spirit v Oval Invincibles</strong><strong> </strong>2.30pm, BBC Two. The women’s game is followed by the men’s teams playing at 6pm.</p>
