<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> signed an executive order on Wednesday punishing the law firm that helped Dominion Voting Systems obtain a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/18/fox-dominion-settle-us-defamation-lawsuit">$787.5m settlement from Fox</a> for lies about the 2020 election.</p> <p>The order against the firm, Susman Godfrey, marks the latest effort by the president to punish attorneys and firms who have opposed his interests.</p> <p>The order seeks to harm the firm by limiting its attorneys from accessing government buildings, revoking security clearances and essentially making it impossible for it to represent anyone who has business before the federal government.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/skadden-staffers-letter-trump">More than 80 ex-staffers of top law firm express ‘deep outrage’ over Trump deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump’s rationale for targeting the firm was not immediately clear.</p> <p>“There were some very bad things that happened with these law firms,” he said in the Oval Office on Wednesday when he signed the order.</p> <p>Susman Godfrey said in a statement that it would challenge the order.</p> <p>“Anyone who knows Susman Godfrey knows we believe in the rule of law, and we take seriously our duty to uphold it. This principle guides us now. There is no question that we will fight this unconstitutional order,” the firm said.</p> <p>Susman Godfrey represented Dominion Voting Systems in its lawsuit against Fox, which ended in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/18/fox-dominion-settle-us-defamation-lawsuit">landmark settlement</a> to avoid a trial. On Wednesday, a Delaware judge ruled in a separate lawsuit that the conservative outlet Newsmax Media defamed Dominion with its false reporting about a rigged 2020 election.</p> <p>Trump has issued orders punishing five other firms for connections to political rivals: Covington &amp; Burling, Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, Jenner &amp; Block, and WilmerHale.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/28/jenner-block-wilmerhale-law-firms-sue-trump">Perkins Coie, Jenner &amp; Block, and WilmerHale</a> all have filed suit against Trump and successfully earned preliminary court orders blocking the orders.
