  <p><strong>Closing summary</strong></p> 
  <p>Our live coverage is ending now. In the meantime, you can find all of our live US politics coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news">here</a>. Here is a summary of the key developments from today:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Utah county attorney <strong>Jeff Gray</strong> formally announced charges against <strong>Tyler Robinson</strong>, the suspect accused of fatally shooting <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong>. Prosecutors have charged Robinson on seven counts, including aggravated murder, and will seek the death penalty. Later, Robinson made his first court appearance at a virtual hearing, wearing an anti-suicide smock, where Utah judge <strong>Tony F. Graf </strong>ruled Robinson qualifies for a court-appointed attorney and granted a pre-trial protective order for Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk. The next hearing in Robinson’s case is scheduled for September 29, and will be conducted virtually.</p></li> 
   <li><p>FBI director Kash Patel faced questions from the Senate judiciary committee during a more than four hour long hearing. The hearing twice included a shouting match between Patel and Democratic senator <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-new-york-times-defamation-charlie-kirk-vance-miller-news-updates-us-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68c990818f0870640b690afb#block-68c990818f0870640b690afb">Cory Booker</a></strong> and later <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-new-york-times-defamation-charlie-kirk-vance-miller-news-updates-us-politics-live?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68c9a1958f0862eec18cf4ef#block-68c9a1958f0862eec18cf4ef">Adam Schiff</a></strong>. Patel defended his leadership of the FBI, denying that he has politicized the agency and ordered firings of agents and personnel over their work on cases related to Donald Trump or the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Patel also defended his actions over prematurely posting on social media that the suspect in Charlie Kirk’s killing had been found, only for that person to be released. Democratic senator <strong>Dick Durbin</strong> and others said Patel’s actions pointed to his lack of experience and “sparked mass confusion” during the investigation.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> will appeal the court decision blocking<strong> Donald Trump’s </strong>bid to fire Federal Reserve governor <strong>Lisa Cook</strong>. Yesterday, a US appeals court declined to allow Trump to fire Cook, in the latest step in a legal battle that threatens the Fed’s longstanding independence.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump arrived in the United Kingdom where he will make an uprecedented second state visit.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> said that<strong> Trump</strong> has invited him back to the White House on September 29. The trip will be the fourth time Netanyahu, a vocal support of Trump’s, has visited the White House since Trump’s second term began in January.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump</strong> filed a $15b defamation lawsuit against <strong>the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/new-york-times">New York Times</a> </strong>and publishing firm<strong> Penguin Random House </strong>today<strong>.</strong> The lawsuit is one of a string the president has filed against media outlets, including a $10b defamation case he filed against the Wall Street Journal in July.</p></li> 
   <li><p>California governor <strong>Gavin Newsom </strong>joined a host of Democratic influencers and officials for a virtual rally in support of Proposition 50, also known as the Election Rigging Response Act. The act seeks to redraw California’s political map, in response to efforts by politicians in Republican-led states to do the same.</p></li>

  <p>According to the report, 584 police officers were dispatched to protests that day, where they fired 1,040 projectiles, including bean bags, rubber and foam rounds, and tear gas. Six injuries were reported as a result of the projectiles.</p>

  <p><strong>With Donald Trump recently arrived in the United Kingdom, for an unprecedented second state visit, London’s mayor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sadiqkhan">Sadiq Khan</a> is sharing his thoughts on the president’s visit with The Guardian.</strong></p> 
  <p>In an opinion piece titled, “After the far right’s march on our streets, Londoners must show Trump we reject his politics of fear,” Khan writes:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>Something in our country changed at the weekend. Like cities across the UK, London has seen protests organised by the far right before, but this felt different. Over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted">100,000 people filled the capital</a>. Tens of thousands of them marched peacefully. But some violently attacked the police officers tasked with keeping Londoners safe. Elon Musk tried to rally protesters against our democracy, telling them to “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/what-did-elon-musk-say-at-far-right-uk-rally-and-did-his-remarks-break-the-law">fight back or you die</a>”.</p> 
   <p>The scenes we saw didn’t come from nowhere. For far too long, our politicians and pundits have refused to condemn the rising tide of hatred in this country, instead choosing to dabble in dog-whistle politics and dangerous rhetoric themselves.</p>

  <p>The Massachusetts Democrat is emphasizing the importance of checks and balances, and preserving independent bodies, including the Federal Reserve Board.</p> 
  <p>“The problem is the Republicans just try to outdo each other in how fast they fall to the floor to kiss Donald Trump’s feet. And the consequence of that is the whole basic structure of government now is breaking apart,” she said.</p> 
  <p>“That’s why I see Prop 50 as a fight for the independence of our democracy. A fight to say there’s a check on power,” she added.</p>

  <p>In statements to Reuters, the Times and Penguin Random House said the president’s lawsuit makes no legitimate legal claims.</p>

  <p><strong>Earlier today, Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace introduced a resolution to censure Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar over comments Omar made following the death of far-right political activist Charlie Kirk.</strong></p> 
  <p>“Ilhan Omar has shown us exactly who she is: someone who defends political violence and refuses to condemn the loss of innocent lives when it doesn’t suit her agenda, even the cold-blooded assassination of Charlie Kirk,” Mace said in a <a href="https://mace.house.gov/media/press-releases/mace-moves-strip-ilhan-omar-committee-seats">statement</a> released before she introdued the resolution. “If you mock a political assassination and celebrate murder, you don’t get to keep your committee seat, you get consequences.”</p> 
  <p>A spokesperson for Omar challenged that characterization in comments shared with CNN.</p> 
  <p>“Congresswoman Omar was one of the first to condemn Charlie Kirk’s murder. She explicitly expressed her sympathies and prayers to his wife and children. She condemned his assassination and has routinely condemned political violence, no matter the political ideology,” the spokesperson said. “In her interview, she also grappled with his divisive legacy, but she in no way implied violence was deserved, nor did she celebrate his death.”</p> 
  <p>The news comes as members of the Trump administration have fired public officials who have spoken out about Kirk’s legacy, and just one day after <strong>JD Vance</strong> guest-hosted Kirk’s podcast, where he told listeners to “Call them out, and hell, call their employer,” if they knew anyone celebrating Kirk’s death.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Charlie Kirk shooting suspect charges: what we've learned from news conference</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The suspect in the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-new-york-times-defamation-charlie-kirk-vance-miller-news-updates-us-politics-live?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68c9a93b8f0862eec18cf53b#block-68c9a93b8f0862eec18cf53b">charged</a> with <strong>aggravated murder and weapon and obstruction offenses</strong>, and the state of Utah will be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-new-york-times-defamation-charlie-kirk-vance-miller-news-updates-us-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68c9a9fc8f080f2d1dcf1eef#block-68c9a9fc8f080f2d1dcf1eef">pursuing</a> the <strong>death penalty</strong>. He continues to be held without bail and is due to appear in court for the first time – via video link – at 5pm ET.</p> 
  <p><strong>DNA “consistent with” Robinson</strong> <strong>was also found on the trigger of the bolt-action rifle</strong> believed to have been used in Kirk’s shooting, as well as on other parts of the rifle, the fired cartridge casing, two of the three unfired cartridges, and the towel the rifle was found wrapped in.</p> 
  <p>According to charging documents filed today, Robinson allegedly <strong>planned the shooting for a little over a week</strong> and <strong>confessed to his roommate/partner</strong>.</p> 
  <p>His roommate told authorities that Robinson texted on 10 September and told them to look under a keyboard. A note was under the keyboard that stated: “<strong>I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I’m going to take it</strong>.”</p> 
  <p>The roommate then texted Robinson and asked if he was joking. Robinson responded: “I am still OK, my love. … Shouldn’t be long till I can come home, but <strong>I gotta grab my rifle still</strong>. To be honest, I had hoped to keep this secret until I died of old age.”</p> 
  <p>In further messages, Robinson said he was the one who shot Kirk. <strong>Roommate:</strong> you weren’t the one who did it right???? <strong>Robinson:</strong> I am, I’m sorry</p> 
  <p>When the roommate asked why he did it, Robinson responded: “<strong>I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can’t be negotiated out</strong>.”</p> 
  <p>In further text messages, Robinson told his roommate that the rifle belonged to his grandfather and sent several messages about how he might retrieve it while police were searching for him. He appeared to consider whether it could be traced back to him.</p> 
  <p>Authorities said the suspect might have concealed the murder weapon in his pants as he walked on campus, tipping off authorities with his “unusual gait”. The suspect walked “with very little bending in his right leg, <strong>consistent with a rifle being hidden in his pants</strong>,” the charging documents read.</p> 
  <p>Robinson then instructed the roommate to <strong>delete “incriminating” text messages and to not speak to police or media</strong>, according to the documents.</p> 
  <p>We’ve also learned that the <strong>suspect’s mother identified him in a photo released by authorities</strong>. His mother told the police that her son had “<strong>become more political and started to move more to the lef</strong>t” over the last year or so and had become “more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented”.</p> 
  <p>In one conversation with his parents before the shooting, Robinson mentioned that Kirk would be holding an event at UVU, which Robinson said was <strong>a “stupid venue”</strong> for the event. <strong>Robinson accused Kirk of spreading hate</strong>.</p> 
  <p>While talking to his parents at their home after the shooting, Robinson allegedly implied that he shot Kirk, “and stated that he couldn’t go to jail, and just wanted to end it”, alluding to suicide. He allegedly told his parents when they asked why he did it: “<strong>There’s too much evil in the guy</strong>.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Charlie Kirk suspect charged with aggravated murder, facing death penalty</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>My colleagues <strong>Anna Betts</strong> and <strong>Ramon Antonio Vargas</strong> have the full report on the news conference:</p> 
  <p>Utah state prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson, the man accused of fatally shooting the far-right activist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">Charlie Kirk</a>, on Tuesday with aggravated murder, meaning the 22-year-old could face the death penalty if convicted.</p> 
  <p>Jeff Gray, the top prosecutor in Utah county, said Robinson also ordered his roommate to delete incriminating text messages and stay silent if police questioned him in the aftermath of the Turning Point USA executive director’s killing on 10 September.</p> 
  <p>“I do not take this decision lightly,” Gray said. “And it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney based solely on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime.”</p>

Patel defended his leadership of the FBI, denying that he has politicized the agency and ordered firings of agents and personnel over their work on cases related to Donald Trump or the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. “No one at the FBI is terminated for case assignments alone,” Patel said, in careful wording picked apart by Democrats.</p> 
  <p>He also defended his actions over prematurely posting on social media that the suspect in Charlie Kirk’s killing had been found, only for that person to be released. Democratic senator Dick Durbin and others said Patel’s actions pointed to his lack of experience and “sparked mass confusion” during the investigation.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Patel insists FBI employees weren't terminated 'for case assignments alone'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Democratic senator Adam Schiff asks Patel again whether FBI employees were fired for political retribution.</p> 
  <p>“Are you testifying today that you never terminated anyone at the FBI in whole or in part because of a prior case assignment?” Schiff asks.</p> 
  <p>Patel says: “<strong>No one at the FBI is terminated for case assignments alone</strong>.”</p> 
  <p>Schiff highlights that Patel used the word alone. “Mr Patel, did you in whole or in part terminate anyone at the FBI <strong>because they worked on the Trump investigation, or because they worked on January 6</strong>?”</p> 
  <p>Patel repeats: “No one at the FBI has been terminated for case assignments alone.”</p> 
  <p>Schiff asks: “Does that mean they were terminated in part because they were assigned to a January 6 case, or assigned to the Mar-a-Lago case? You’re being very precise here, Mr Patel, you’re saying alone. That means they were fired in part because they were assigned those cases. Is that your testimony?”</p> 
  <p>“Absolutely not,” Patel said.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Pennsylvania’s governor Josh Shapiro has said the US must “turn the tide” against political violence and the belief that government can’t solve problems while also rejecting vengeance, the AP reports.</p> 
  <p>Shapiro, a Democrat, delivered the remarks at the Eradicate Hate Global Summit in Pittsburgh. Shapiro said <strong>leaders must condemn all forms of political violence</strong> and <strong>shouldn’t use violence as a pretext for more violence or to prosecute constitutionally protected speech</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Shapiro also criticized Donald Trump, saying some people “in the dark corners of the internet, all the way to the Oval Office, <strong>want to cherry-pick which instances of political violence they want to condemn</strong>”.</p> 
  <p>Trump and his allies have come under fire for blaming political violence squarely on the left, condemning violent acts committed against Republicans, and ignoring acts of violence against Democrats.</p> 
  <p>In April, Shapiro and his family fled the governor’s official residence in the middle of the night after an alleged arsonist set it on fire in an attempt to kill Shapiro.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Kash Patel to face Senate questions over investigation into Charlie Kirk’s killing</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Under-fire FBI director Kash Patel will confront Senate Democrats at a congressional hearing <strong>at 9am ET</strong>, likely to be dominated by questions about the investigation into the killing of Charlie Kirk, as well as the agency’s role in reviewing the files related to the Epstein case, and recent firings of senior officials who have accused Patel of illegal political retribution.</p> 
  <p>His appearance before the Senate judiciary committee represents the first oversight hearing of Patel’s young but tumultuous tenure. Most recently <strong>he has faced <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/kash-patel-criticized-actions-posts-charlie-kirk-shooting-investigatio-rcna231043">criticism</a> for his actions and social media posts during the Kirk shooting investigation</strong>, which have raised questions about his experience and judgement, including being seen as “grandstanding” with regards to his own role, and prematurely (and wrongly) announcing on X that the suspect had been caught.</p> 
  <p>This hearing provides a high-stakes platform for him to try to reassure wary lawmakers that he is the right person for the job at a time of internal upheaval and mounting concerns about political violence inside the US, which <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and his allies have sought to blame squarely on the left.</p> 
  <p>We’ll bring you all the latest from the hearing when it gets underway.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Trump administration will <strong>appeal the court decision blocking Donald Trump’s bid to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook</strong>, the White House said on Tuesday.</p> 
  <p>“The President lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause. The Administration will appeal this decision and looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.</p> 
  <p><strong>Yesterday, a US appeals court declined to allow Trump to fire Cook</strong>, in the latest step in a legal battle that threatens the Fed’s longstanding independence.</p> 
  <p>The decision by the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit meant that Cook could for now remain at the Fed ahead of its policy meeting today and Wednesday where it is expected to cut US interest rates to shore up a cooling labor market.</p> 
  <p>The judge denied the justice department’s request to put on hold a judge’s order temporarily blocking Trump from removing Cook, an appointee of Joe Biden. It was the first time a president has pursued such action since the central bank’s founding in 1913. The administration was expected to appeal the ruling to the US supreme court.</p> 
  <p>Here’s our story on that from last night:</p>

  <p>The US vice-president guest-hosted Kirk’s podcast on Monday and said that people who “see someone celebrating Charlie’s murder” should “call them out”. He added: “Hell, call their employer. We don’t believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility, and there is no civility in the celebration of political assassination.”</p>

The website was originally named “Expose Charlie’s Murderers” but rebranded Monday to the “Charlie Kirk Data Foundation”.</p> 
  <p>Trump allies have sought to link Kirks killing – without evidence – to what they say is a coordinated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-trump">leftwing “terror”</a> movement that supports political violence, funded by progressive and liberal charities. This has led to fears of a draconian crackdown on free speech.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Progressive groups fear ‘McCarthy era’ attacks in wake of Charlie Kirk shooting</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The president, vice-president and members of Congress have begun calling for the government to investigate progressive organizations in the wake of the Charlie Kirk murder, in terms those targeted say are reminiscent of the House Un-American Activities Committee and the “red scare” of the 1950s.</strong></p> 
  <p>Donald Trump, speaking to Fox &amp; Friends on Friday, presented “vicious and horrible” radicals on the left of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics">US politics</a> as a roadblock to the country coming together politically after the shooting. On Sunday, he amplified his attack on political enemies by declaring that “a lot of people that you would traditionally say are on the left … [are] already under investigation”.</p> 
  <p>The posture is being echoed by members of his administration.</p> 
  <p>“With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the DoJ, Homeland Security, and throughout this government, to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/jd-vance-charlie-kirk-podcast">said</a> Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, speaking to Vice-President JD Vance while Vance guest-hosted Kirk’s podcast Monday. “We will do it in Charlie’s name.”</p> 
  <p>The day after Kirk’s murder, 22 members of the House freedom caucus <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/000045cecbf68668f1c6603a1/files/8deaa23b-77f1-5c2d-fe28-861d7dfdf795/Roy_Select_Committee_Letter_v2_2_.pdf">sent a letter</a> to the House speaker, asking for the creation of a select committee on “the money, influence, and power behind the radical left’s assault on America and the rule of law”.</p> 
  <p>The letter, echoing commentary from the president and the right, contends that Kirk’s murder is of a pattern of “coordinated attack” by “NGOs, donors, media, public officials” and others, attempting to tie together widely distinct incidents , from the February 2024 murder of Georgia college student Laken Riley to the killing last month of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte.</p> 
  <p>None of the organizations in the letter, nor other prominent organizations on the political left, said they had been contacted by federal law enforcement or Congress in the wake of the Kirk killing. Some, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) or the Open Society Foundations – an organization closely associated with financier George Soros – have been through rounds of rightwing congressional inquiry during Trump’s first term.</p>

  <p><strong>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s shakeup of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has forced Mississippi to stop gathering critical data on women’s experiences before, during and after pregnancy – even as the state recently declared a public health emergency over its surging infant mortality rate.</strong></p> 
  <p>Mississippi has<strong> </strong>suspended data collection for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/pregnancy">Pregnancy</a> Risk Assessment Monitoring System (Prams), a national database that has been integral to policymaking on maternal and infant health for nearly four decades, the Guardian has learned.</p> 
  <p>Prams functions as a partnership between state-level health officials and a little-known but influential CDC agency called the Division of Reproductive Health, which has lost most of its staff<strong> – </strong>nearly 100 people – in the Trump administration’s purges of federal workers, according to records<strong> </strong>in<strong> </strong>a lawsuit filed by several Democratic-led states over the purges.</p> 
  <p>As a result, many of the division’s projects, including Prams, have sputtered to a halt, the lawsuit alleges.</p> 
  <p>The division will likely be unable to obtain accurate nationwide data on maternal and infant health in 2024, 2025 and 2026, an unnamed CDC staffer said in one declaration included in the lawsuit.</p> 
  <p>Researchers rely on Prams data to test out potential health interventions to improve maternal and child health,<strong> </strong>while states use it to make the case for federal funding for programs that aim to reduce infant deaths, improve care for women and help children with special needs.</p> 
  <p>The changes at the division forced Mississippi to terminate its 2024 Prams data collection and has delayed its 2025 collection, a Mississippi health department spokesperson said in an email. The spokesperson also attributed the work stoppage to “a federal directive” issued in January, but did not answer follow-up questions about the nature of that directive. In the meantime, the spokesperson said, the department is at work analyzing its existing Prams data.</p>

  <p><strong>Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order that would send national guard troops into Memphis, in a “replica” of the administration’s expanding military-led response to urban crime in Democratic-run cities.</strong></p> 
  <p>The move was welcome by Tennessee’s Republican governor, Bill Lee, who stood behind Trump in the Oval Office as he signed a presidential memo establishing a Memphis Safe Task Force.</p> 
  <p>“We’re going to fix that just like we did Washington,” Trump said.</p> 
  <p>Announcing the taskforce in an Oval Office meeting, Trump said the troops would work alongside federal authorities from various agencies, including the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Drug Enforcement Administration; Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice); the US Marshall’s service and the Department of Justice. In his remarks on Monday, the president cited a slew of crime statistics and vowed to end the “savagery” and to “make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/memphis">Memphis</a> safe again”.</p> 
  <p>Lee thanked the president for the deployment. “I’m tired of crime holding the great city of Memphis back,” the governor said.</p> 
  <p>Trump told Lee that the crime-fighting crackdown “will be your proudest moment” and predicted that crime in the city would “plummet” within weeks.</p> 
  <p>Trump was also joined at the Oval Office signing by the state’s Republican senators, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty.</p> 
  <p>Trump deployed national guard troops to Washington last month and federalized the city’s police force to “crack down” on crime in the nation’s capitol. Violent crime was already at a 30-year low in the city.</p>

  <p><strong>In response to a question about why he did not order flags lowered to half-staff to honor Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives who was assassinated alongside her husband this summer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> initially said he was “not familiar” with the case.</strong></p> 
  <p>The question came up during a briefing in the Oval Office on Monday, in light of the president’s order last week to lower flags in response to the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk.</p> 
  <p>Trump was pressed on why he and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> continued cast blame the left for a rise in political violence when elected officials and activists from both parties have been targets.</p> 
  <p>The exchange began when the reporter asked about the tributes paid by the White House to Kirk, the founder of the conservative youth activist group Turning Point USA and a close ally of the president and his family.</p> 
  <p>“Do you think it would have been fitting to lower the flags to half-staff when Melissa Hortman, the Minnesota house speaker, was gunned down by an assassin as well?” asked Nancy Cordes, the chief White House correspondent for CBS News.</p>

  <p>“I’m not familiar. The who?” Trump replied, leaning in across the Resolute Desk.</p> 
  <p>“The Minnesota house speaker, a Democrat, who was assassinated this summer,” she said.</p> 
  <p>“Oh,” Trump replied. “Well, if the governor had asked me to do that, I would have done that.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">JD Vance threatens crackdown on ‘far-left’ groups after Charlie Kirk shooting</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance">JD Vance</a> has assailed what he called the “far left” and its increased tolerance for violence while guest-hosting Charlie Kirk’s podcast on Monday, saying the administration would be working to dismantle groups who celebrate Kirk’s death and political violence against their opponents.</strong></p> 
  <p>Vance, hosting the podcast from his office next to the White House, spoke to high-profile members of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> and some of Kirk’s long-time friends in the movement, including Tucker Carlson and Trump adviser Stephen Miller.</p> 
  <p>Vance said the administration would “work to dismantle the institutions that promote violence and terrorism in our own country”.</p> 
  <p>The administration would be working to do that in the coming months and would “explore every option to bring real unity to our country and stop those who would kill their fellow Americans because they don’t like what they say”, Vance said.</p> 
  <p>The political leanings of the shooter who killed Kirk are not yet clear. Bullet casings found with the shooter’s gun were inscribed with references to video games and online culture. Still, prominent figures on the right – before a shooter was apprehended – declared war on the left, claiming it was responsible for Kirk’s death.</p> 
  <p>There is no evidence of a network supporting the shooter, and Miller did not provide substantiation of his claims that there is a “vast domestic terror movement” at play.</p> 
  <p>Miller also detailed how the administration would use the federal government to achieve this goal.</p> 
  <p>“With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, [Department of] Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks,” Miller said, adding that they would do this “in Charlie’s name”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Opening summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.</p> 
  <p>We start with news that <strong>Donald Trump has filed a $15bn defamation lawsuit against the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/new-york-times">New York Times</a> in his latest use of legal action targeting a major media outlet</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The US president accused it of being a “mouthpiece” for the Democratic party and of “spreading false and defamatory content” about him.</p> 
  <p>It comes after the New York Times said last week that it had been threatened with legal action by the White House, following articles about a crude birthday note given to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The note bears Trump’s signature, but the president has denied being its author.</p> 
  <p>In July he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/02/emma-tucker-murdoch-editor-donald-trump-wall-street-journal">launched legal action against another big US paper, the Wall Street Journal</a>, and its proprietor Rupert Murdoch, after it first reported the existence of the note, which also featured a lewd drawing. It has since been published, but Trump continues to deny being its author.</p> 
  <p>The filing against the NYT, the latest demonstration of the president’s willingness to use legal action against the media, was made by Trump’s lawyers to a district court in Florida on Monday night.</p> 
  <p>It names several articles and one book written by two of the publication’s journalists and published in the lead-up to the 2024 election.</p> 
  <p>“The Times has betrayed the journalistic ideals of honesty, objectivity, and accuracy that it once professed,” it states, also accusing the NYT of being “a leading, and unapologetic, purveyor of falsehoods against President Trump”.</p> 
  <p>The NYT has not yet responded.</p>

   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump announced he will deploy the national guard to Memphis during an Oval Office ceremony attended by the Tennessee governor Bill Lee.</strong> He added that he is considering sending national guard troops to “Chicago probably next” and floated cities such as St Louis may follow.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A US appeals court ruled that Lisa Cook can remain on the Federal Reserve board, denying Trump’s attempt to remove Cook from the body ahead of a policy meeting scheduled later today.</strong> Trump will likely appeal the ruling to the supreme court. Meanwhile, <strong>Reuters</strong> reported that the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, has “no reason to believe” that Cook broke any tax rules involving a home she declared her primary residence.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Senate voted to approve Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve board in a narrow 48-47 vote largely along party lines.</strong> Miran, a Trump ally, currently serves as the White House’s chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
