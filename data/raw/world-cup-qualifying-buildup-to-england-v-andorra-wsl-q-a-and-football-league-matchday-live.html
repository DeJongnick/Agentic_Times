Mbappe is joint second in the scoring charts for France and needs to score seven more to beat the record held by Olivier Giroud. considering he’s just 26 years old, one imagines Mbappe will end up obliterating the record, unless of course he spits the dummy over something or other and stops playing for France.</p> <p>“Big up to Titi [Henry], but now I want to surpass him,” said Mbappe after the game. “It’s an honour to equal a player like Henry, everyone knows what he means to us French people, even more so to strikers. He’s someone who paved the way, and I have a lot of respect and admiration for him.”</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-06T12:15:54.298Z">at 1.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68bc21018f08638a14b78982" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T12:02:44.323Z">1.02pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Thank you very much, Suzanne and enjoy this afternoon’s game at the Emirates.</strong> And thanks to you, our readers for asking such interesting questions. I don’t mind admitting that every day is a school day when it comes to women’s football for this grizzled old hack but I find the whole London City Lionesses project fascinating. I’m looking forward to seeing how they get on against Arsenal this afternoon. </p> <p>While I didn’t see anything more than a few snippets of the Chelsea v Manchester City match last night because I was on Denmark v Scotland World Cup qualifier duty, I do find it odd that Lily Murphy had to wait so long for treatment to what was clearly a very serious injury. One of those things, I suppose but props to Hannah Hampton for getting the medics to her rival’s side. Here’s hoping Lily makes a full and speedy recovery. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bc1e988f085f50533e8d9e" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T11:45:29.920Z">12.45pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Why is there so much secrecy around transfer costs in the women’s game? Is it harder for you and other reporters to find out the cost of players compared to the men’s game? Will this change any time soon?</strong> wonders Claire Pryke.</p> <p>GOOD QUESTION! This is absolutely infuriating and we all work extremely hard to try and get this information as accurate as possible, requiring multiple sources. I hope it changes and clubs are more open and less prickly to this information being out there.</p> <p>I feel like there is a view that if a buying club has spent big they don’t want other selling clubs to know because when they’re in the market again selling clubs will drive up prices accordingly. However, the reality is that everyone operating in that arena at club level knows exactly what money has changed hands and so the only people in the dark are the media and fans. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bc1dd68f08638a14b7896b" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T11:43:59.834Z">12.43pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>I was surprised that Michelle Agyemang returned to Brighton on loan – a huge boost for them, but could Arsenal really not have done with her this season?”</strong> asks Olivia Burke.</p> <p>I’d have loved to see Agyemang in an Arsenal shirt this season (as a not-so-secret fan) but I can completely understand the loan move. At Brighton the 19-year-old will be able to operate and get more WSL and starting experience with less of a harsh spotlight on her. I’m sure Arsenal will have made sure that Brighton will give her minutes before agreeing to the move as they are really hot on her development.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Arsenal have a host of forwards capable of delivering. There may be times when Arsenal struggle and people wonder whether Agyemang could have been the difference, but sometimes the immediate interests of the club need to be put behind the development path of a player they see as having a long term future at the club.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bc1cd48f087e152e27fb44" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T11:38:02.666Z">12.38pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The record transfers this summer have been eye-catching but is women’s football mirroring the men’s game in leaving a substantial gulf under the best-resourced clubs?</strong> asks Steven Miller.</p> <p>Yep, it’s definitely an issue. Despite the talk of doing things differently, the reality is that from a financial and commercial point of view the women’s game is increasingly mirroring the men’s. For many years I’ve been saying women’s football should look at a maximum wage as well as a good quality minimum wage and work on relegations to ensure the league remains competitive.</p> <p>Trickle-down economics doesn’t work, and it doesn’t work in football. I’d like to see the 75/25% split of the broadcast money in favour of WSL over WSL2 flipped on its head, for example, closing the gap instead of enshrining an ever growing one.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bc1bf88f085f50533e8d8a" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T11:36:32.287Z">12.36pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>“What exactly happened in the WSL opener during the Lily Murphy incident [Mancherster City’s Murphy went down injured with what looked like a very serious arm or shoulder injury but play was not stopped immediately]? Why did Emily Heaslip wait until the ball went out of play despite [Chelsea ghoalkeeper] Hannah Hampton’s clear signalling of an urgent issue?”</strong> asks Jo Walsh.</p> <p>It was a baffling incident. I’m not sure why they waited so long with an opposition player indicating it looked bad. Hampton came running over to the sidelines when the medics were on and looked to speak to Bompastor and seemed to be calling for the stretcher to get on. Fair play to the goalkeeper, but the officials need to do better.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-06T11:39:25.960Z">at 12.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68bc1ae78f085f50533e8d86" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T11:32:51.641Z">12.32pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>“Last night, Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor was frustrated when Man City goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita needed treatment early in the game, thinking it was a tactical time-out at a time when Chelsea were starting to build pressure. Has the level of cynicism grown in the time you’ve been watching and writing about women’s football? If so, is that an unavoidable consequence of the women’s game getting bigger and bigger?”</strong> asks Mandy Cooper.</p> <p>Yes, goalkeepers going down for a little tactical time out has very much become the norm and been on the rise for several years. It’s slightly ironic that the frustrations have come from Bompastor, when former Chelsea goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger was a master of the tactical time out when Emma Hayes was in charge.</p> <p>All teams do them, all opposition managers get frustrated by them. How do we stop them? Last night I floated that the keeper should have to be treated off the pitch and an outfield player go between the sticks. Alex Greenwood in goal when Yamashita goes down? Bunny Shaw? That would be fun and stop it.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bc196d8f085f50533e8d80" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T11:23:24.700Z">12.23pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>“Lots of praise for London City Lionesses making transfers this summer but haven’t they ended up massively over the WSL squad limit?</strong> <strong>What options do they have to fix this?”</strong> asks D Powell.</p> <p>Good question, one I’ve had to canvass on more widely in the Arsenal media room. The maximum WSL squad size is 25 players and London City Lionesses have 29 players (and two others already out on loan). The reality is that four will not be able to be registered, I imagine that will be some of the younger players. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bc17ec8f087e152e27fb33" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T11:18:55.966Z">12.18pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>A question for Suzanne from below the line …</strong> </p>  <figure class="element element-comment" data-canonical-url="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/sep/06/world-cup-qualifying-buildup-to-england-v-andorra-wsl-qa-and-football-league-matchday-live#comment-172463150">  <div class="d2-comment-embedded" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"> <div class="d2-left-col"> <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3981633" title="View trinder19’s profile"> <img class="d2-avatar" src="https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/3981633" height="40" width="40" alt="User avatar for trinder19"> </a>  </div> <div class="d2-right-col"> <div itemscope itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <a class="d2-username" href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3981633" title="View trinder19’s profile" itemprop="url"> <span itemprop="givenName">trinder19</span> </a> </div> <div class="d2-permalink"> <a class="d2-datetime" href="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/172463150" title="Link to this comment" itemprop="datePublished">06 September 2025 10:19am</a> </div>  <div class="d2-body" itemprop="text"><p>@SuzyWrack - where do you stand on the debate about whether Chelsea's utter domestic dominance is diminishing interest in the women's game in England or whether it's beneficial because it's raising standards? I think it's a bit of both and that we're fortunate to have such a fabulously successful nation team that is doing so, so much to attract supporters to the game. Would that momentum build even faster if we had a more competitive domestic scene?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>I get frustrated when this question spills into criticism of a successful team investing in the women’s game (which is not the implication of the question, but I’m having a minor side rant). I agree it’s a bit of both, Chelsea’s constant success is probably also impacting their ability to significantly grow their own crowds.</p> <p>The turnout at Stamford Bridge last night was disappointing, but a lack of jeopardy doesn’t necessarily get people out of their armchairs. The onus has to be on other clubs (and their owners) to invest and properly challenge Chelsea and at the top, WSL Football needs to regulate to make sure the league remains competitive. The raising of the minimum wage in the WSL and WSL2 is a step in the right direction in that respect. </p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bc16268f087e152e27fb2e" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T11:09:45.756Z">12.09pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>With all the investment they’ve had, can London City Lionesses become a genuine WSL force over the next few years?” </strong>asks Paula Anderson.<strong> “Also, do they have a realistic chance of breaking the top four this season or should we temper expectations?”</strong></p> <p>Given Michele Kang’s ongoing commitment and deep pockets I think we can say with a decent degree of certainty that London City Lionesses will be a serious force within the next few years, <em>writes Suzanne Wrack</em>. Top four this season is probably a stretch, but anything’s possible. The squad is stacked with top level experience and upcoming talent but it could take some time for them to gel and settle. That’s where teams bidding to break into the top four have fallen short before. Each team that has finished fifth in the last few years, has bought the following summer with ambitions of breaking into the top four but have struggled with the high turnover of players and fallen way short.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-06T11:14:45.547Z">at 12.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68bc14f98f087e152e27fb2b" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T11:07:56.466Z">12.07pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Good afternoon all.</strong> Our women’s football correspondent Suzanne Wrack is at the Emirates ahead of Arsenal’s match against the London City Lionesses (kick-off 1.30pm BST) and will be fielding your interrogatory projectiles shortly.

He always tried to get the best deal for the club, and if a transfer was recommended and possible he did his utmost to secure it. People forget there are many facets in a transfer, including dealing with agents. Sir Alex Ferguson famously said Daniel was “more painful to deal with than a hip replacement” but let’s not forget Manchester United took Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Carrick. Daniel was a loyal and hard-working custodian of Spurs, a genuine supporter who knew his job was to protect the club.</p> <p>Many supporters regard winning as the only thing that matters but, generally speaking, the fan on the street doesn’t understand the intricacies of running a club. It is so difficult and that is amplified when so much revolves around emotion.

Picking Loftus-Cheek over Curtis Jones for example makes no sense to me.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class="element element-comment" data-canonical-url="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/sep/06/world-cup-qualifying-buildup-to-england-v-andorra-wsl-qa-and-football-league-matchday-live#comment-172462930">  <div class="d2-comment-embedded" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"> <div class="d2-left-col"> <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2602427" title="View leadballoon’s profile"> <img class="d2-avatar" src="https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/2602427" height="40" width="40" alt="User avatar for leadballoon"> </a>  </div> <div class="d2-right-col"> <div itemscope itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <a class="d2-username" href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2602427" title="View leadballoon’s profile" itemprop="url"> <span itemprop="givenName">leadballoon</span> </a> </div> <div class="d2-permalink"> <a class="d2-datetime" href="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/172462930" title="Link to this comment" itemprop="datePublished">06 September 2025 9:17am</a> </div>  <div class="d2-body" itemprop="text"><p>There's a logic to including more teams in the final tournament, it's a World Cup after all. But why not take the opportunity of having ever more teams active in the finals to eliminate the long drawn out period of qualification games completely?</p><blockquote></blockquote>It's not as if the qualification is a realistic reflection of how teams do in the finals. Tournaments are about managing a tight squad, pacing, injuries and fatigue over a month or so of successive games in summer. Qualification leagues are about mix-and-match cobbling together from a cast of potentially hundreds for random weekends. They endure varied conditions, long term injuries and various levels of reluctance in participants over a couple of years. It's disruptive to the rest of the game and takes no account of different league seasons across the continents.<blockquote></blockquote>A better format, and a more realistic assessment of team strength would be to hold regional qualification tournaments in a tightly defined period, either the same summer, or summer before the World Cup. Add pre-qualification, to avoid the many mismatches and there's a real chance to maintain interest (public and media across the whole globe) following the development within the qualifications and then the finals of the tournament rather than appearing as random disruptions across the year.</div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bbeb6b8f085f50533e8cb6" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T08:10:03.128Z">9.10am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Things you never thought you’d see</strong>, and really don’t want to see: Boris Johnson in conversation with Nottingham Forest president Evangelos Marinakis.

The key fixture here is England v Andorra at Villa Park, what with Coldplay at Wembley. They never meant to cause trouble, they never meant to cause harm and instead Thomas Tuchel’s barmy army will play in Birmingham.</p> <p>Join us we build up to that, the WSL, where it’s a London derby between Arsenal and big-spending London City.
