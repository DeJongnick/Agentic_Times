<p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted position: </strong>12th (NB: this is not necessarily Will Unwin’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)</p> <p><strong>Last season’s position: </strong>7th</p> <h2>Prospects</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/notts-forestkit/giv-325545mF5kP8DQK8G/" data-alt="Nottingham Forest kits"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/notts-forestkit/giv-325545mF5kP8DQK8G/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>There is a sense they will need to be better in possession and dominate games because playing twice a week, once European competition begins, is especially difficult for a team who are chasing the ball and playing on the counter. The system has worked well for Nuno Espírito Santo in the past, but tevolution may be required to keep Forest ahead of the game. Pre-season has brought an early shift in style and the change has been enthusiastically welcomed within the club.</p> <p>One problem has been evident: they are struggling to score. Forest played seven friendlies, scoring once and enduring five goalless draws. It was not ideal preparation for building on an incredibly successful year, but everyone will forget as long as early points are picked up. A lack of chances being created has not been the issue, more composure in front of goal, which could lead to another striker being welcomed.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/17/elanga-eager-to-showcase-talent-at-newcastle-but-stays-noncommital-on-isaks-future">loss of Anthony Elanga</a> is a problem much time over recent weeks has been spent trying to solve. His electric pace was instrumental in Nuno’s plans and finding a direct replacement is difficult when the predecessor probably could challenge for an Olympic sprinting medal, but there are high expectations of Dan Ndoye after his club-record signing.</p> <p>Considering everyone expected Morgan Gibbs-White to join Tottenham for £60m, the fact he has stayed and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/26/tottenham-stunned-as-morgan-gibbs-white-signs-deal-to-stay-at-nottingham-forest">signed a new three-year contract</a> is incredible news for the club. Evangelos Marinakis has received plenty of criticism since Forest’s promotion, but deserves credit for single-handedly taking on the role of convincing Gibbs-White to commit at the City Ground.</p> <p>Forest fell short in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/25/nottingham-forest-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">the hunt for the Champions League</a> as tiredness crept into a shallow squad late on and are waiting for more depth to be added. A full-back, midfielder, winger and striker remain on the shopping list.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/nottsforest-zip/giv-32554pqIU5AEXPsqz" data-alt="How they finished in the past five seasons"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/nottsforest-zip/giv-32554pqIU5AEXPsqz">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>The manager</h2> <p>Nuno can do no wrong after leading Forest into Europe for the first time in 30 years. There is plenty of quiet charm to the former goalkeeper, who keeps things simple around the training ground and is respected by everyone who comes into contact with him. He may want to push on from finishing an incredible seventh, but maintaining the stability he has brought is the most important thing. Balancing domestic and continental competitions will be imperative because it is a fine balance for a mid-table side.</p> <h2>Off-field picture</h2> <p>The former Arsenal sporting director Edu has joined the wider group as global head of football. It may explain why the Brazilian/Botafogo market has been further explored, as does the close relationship between Marinakis and John Textor, but the wider effect is yet to be seen. The Gibbs-White saga with Forest complaining about an alleged illegal approach by Tottenham, and the wait to find out whether the club would be in the Europa League or Conference League, ensured things were not calm. Forest were granted planning permission to expand the City Ground to 35,000 by constructing a new 10,000-seat stand.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/bUT9z/1/" data-alt="Last season’s results"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/bUT9z/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Star signing</h2> <p>Ndoye is their record signing and the decision to spend €40m on the Swiss winger was not made lightly. A replacement for Elanga was needed and Ndoye was quickly targeted after shining with Bologna, helping them reach the Champions League and gaining some European experience. At 24, there is room for improvement, which fits the club’s transfer strategy. He is not as quick as Elanga, but his stats are impressive, including scoring eight goals and creating another four in 30 Serie A appearances last season. An eagerness to test himself in the Premier League was key to the move.</p>    <h2>Stepping up</h2> <p>Zach Abbott signed a new four-year deal during the summer and is extremely highly thought of at the City Ground. He was given a surprise first start at right-back in the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City, having started in his more regular centre-back role against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, and will be eager to build on the experience. The 19-year-old has been part of the first-team squad for the past couple of seasons but has made three appearances and is yet to appear in the Premier League. Considering the increase in matches caused by European qualification, it feels inevitable he will get more opportunities.</p> <h2>A big season for …</h2> <p>Taiwo Awoniyi helped keep Forest in the top flight with crucial goals in his first season. Fitness and form have since caused the Nigerian problems, and it has not helped him that Chris Wood has become one of the finest strikers in the Premier League, limiting Awoniyi’s chances. It combined to leave him with two goals from 32 games last season. Awoniyi looked sharp in pre-season, giving the impression his physicality, speed and finishing could again be an asset to Nuno, but will need an early goal to ignite his confidence.</p>
