<p>Must what goes up always come down? <em>Sadia, via email</em></p> <p><em>Send new questions to </em><strong><a href="mailto:nq@theguardian.com">nq@theguardian.com</a></strong><em>.</em></p> <h2>Readers reply</h2> <p>I like Douglas Adams’ idea of flying: to throw yourself at the ground and miss. <strong>LMCollis</strong></p> <p>Yes. Although sometimes it can be: fall back to ground and miss, which we call “being in orbit”. <strong>HaveYouFedTheFish</strong></p> <p>Hopeful that Reform’s poll ratings do not defy this rule and come down very soon. On the other hand, Farage’s levels of hypocrisy show no signs of stopping their ascent. <strong>MosesQuest</strong></p> <p>If they can maintain orbital velocity or achieve escape velocity, they will not come down. <strong>Paulo777</strong></p> <p>That’s what the Venusians said about the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. They just meant, “It won’t come down on Venus,” forgetting that there are other, more important planets around. <strong>jno50</strong></p> <p>Skylab was launched in May 1973 and spread itself over western Australia after “de-orbiting” in July 1979. <strong>MosesQuest</strong></p> <p>No orbit lasts for ever. In low orbit, usually the satellite slows due to atmospheric friction and tidal forces, and the orbit decays till it re-enters. In high orbit (usually geosynchronous), the same gravitational tidal forces are a bit more unpredictable and the orbit can decay, or occasionally the satellite may be ejected into a coincidental orbit around the sun instead. <strong>HaveYouFedTheFish</strong></p> <p>I seriously doubt if I’ll ever become fed down with the whole bloody lot of it. <strong>Eddie Chorepost</strong></p> <p><a href="https://historyofyesterday.com/the-man-who-held-his-hand-raised-for-45-years/">Amar Bharati</a> has kept his right arm raised for 50 years. I think he would find it difficult to lower it now. <strong>GrasmereGardens</strong></p> <p>My football team always has. But maybe they’ll prove this wrong before I die. <strong>minermackem</strong></p> <p>Once the price of groceries goes up, they tend not to come down. <strong>Sagarmatha1953</strong></p> <p><br></p>
