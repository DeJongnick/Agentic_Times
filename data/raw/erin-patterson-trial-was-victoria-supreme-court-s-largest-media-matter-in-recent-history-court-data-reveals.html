<p>The Erin Patterson trial was the Victorian supreme court’s biggest case in terms of media interest in recent history, with more than 250 journalists registering for court updates on the trial.</p> 
<p>On Monday a jury found Patterson guilty of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder a fourth with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/10/mushroom-murders-trial-erin-patterson-australia-second-week-ntwnfb">deadly beef wellington lunch</a> laced with death cap mushrooms almost two years ago. The media coverage has been consistent and extensive during the two-and-a-half months of the trial and has dominated media outlets this week.</p> 
<p>The cast of characters covering the trial included nine authors, seven podcast producers, seven documentary crews and a television drama series, a spokesperson for the court told the media on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The ABC announced last week that Toxic, “a layered and intricate series” exploring the events surrounding the beef wellington lunch, had been commissioned from producer Tony Ayres. Hachette will publish Recipe for Murder, a book by Duncan McNab, in October, with Allen &amp; Unwin releasing The Mushroom Murders by Greg Haddrick shortly after.</p>

<p>The supreme court said 252 journalists’ and outlets’ emails were on the court’s media list, while 190 journalists were provided the audio-only livestream details to listen to the hearing in the Latrobe Valley law courts in Morwell. After the verdict was handed down on Monday, an additional seven international media outlets made contact with the court as the story travelled to the UK, US, New Zealand and beyond.</p> 
<p>“These figures make the trial the biggest matter media-wise the court has managed in recent history,” a spokesperson said in an unusual statement from the judicial system which also praised the coverage as largely fair and accurate.</p> 
<p>“Given the significant volume of trial material published and broadcast, the court was overall pleased with the quality and diligence of media reporting during the trial.”</p>

<p>However, there were some misfires in the reporting of R v Erin Patterson, which were only made public after the verdict. During the trial a small number of inaccuracies were corrected.</p> 
<p>The court was actively monitoring trial coverage, alongside the parties, to safeguard the trial’s integrity, the spokesperson said.</p> 
<p>“As with all matters, media were reminded they must report fairly and accurately and only report information that was presented to the jury.”</p> 
<p>Justice Christopher Beale issued 16 directions to remove content, including four against individuals on social media. Most of the directions were for alleged potential breaches of sub judice contempt law.</p> 
<p>The court was concerned by the media outlets, commentators, and individuals on social media who purported to be covering the case and providing “updates” but who were not registered with the court, did not attend hearings and had not been warned of the legal responsibilities.</p> 
<p>They had “no understanding of their legal responsibilities or the trial’s complexities,” the spokesperson said. “At least one such outlet has been referred to the Office of Public Prosecutions for contempt as a result.”</p>

<p>The Kyle and Jackie O Show has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/07/kyle-and-jackie-o-face-prosecution-for-contempt-erin-patterson-trial-comments-ntwnfb">referred for possible prosecution</a> for contempt after comments made on air during the trial, including Kyle Sandilands saying, “Just lock that bitch up.”</p> 
<p>Beale also considered whether to take action for contempt against a “Psychology of Serial Killers” event and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/mamamia">Mamamia</a> podcasters for statements allegedly made during the trial.</p> 
<p>“I remind media and podcasters that ignorance of the law is no excuse, and I remind them that the court’s media team will continue to monitor coverage of this trial to safeguard the trial’s integrity,” Beale said last month in the absence of the jury.</p> 
<p>The supreme court said the fascination with the mushroom trial, which was “dissected in popular culture”, meant ensuring a fair trial was particularly challenging.</p> 
<p>“[It] should serve as a reminder why the principle of sub judice exists – to ensure every person who appears in court is afforded a fair trial,” the spokesperson said.</p> 
<p>In a personal note to journalists, the court acknowledged those who had attended who “put your lives on hold as much as the jury and parties did”.</p> 
<p>“I’ve never seen such a volume of work that you all produced every day – you should be very proud and I hope you’re getting a well-deserved break soon.”</p>
