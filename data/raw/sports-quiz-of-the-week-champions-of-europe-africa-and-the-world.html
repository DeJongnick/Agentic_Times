    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:A - They were never in the lead against Sweden or Spain and only took the lead against Italy in the 119th minute., 2:A - England are finally winning on penalties – even if they're still not particularly good at them. , 3:D - The defender says she played with a fractured tibia in her left leg, which was “very painful”. , 4:D - Wiegman’s run in major tournaments over the last decade is incredible: Euros winner in 2017, World Cup finalist in 2019, Euros winner in 2022, World Cup finalist in 2023 and Euros winner in 2025., 5:A - Nigeria came from two goals down to beat hosts Morocco 3-2 in the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final., 6:A - The Lions only conceded one try in 10 games. Their standout player on that tour was the winger Alexander Obolensky, who had been born in St Petersburg before settling in London. He is best known for scoring two tries on his England debut – a 13–0 victory over the All Blacks, the first time England had beaten New Zealand. , 7:B - The 18-year-old won the World Matchplay title at the weekend, making him the fifth player (and by far the youngest) to have completed the PDC triple crown. , 8:C - Olesen is caddying for his girlfriend, the Welsh golfer Darcey Harry. , 9:B - The Open is just her second tournament as a professional. The Scottish Open was her first and she won it. She won the Irish Open while still competing as an amateur. , 10:C - He travelled at an average speed of 27.3 mph., 11:A - Cyclists from Slovenia (two), Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Austria, Norway, France (two) and Ireland made it the first all-European top 10 in decades. , 12:D - Vauquelin fractured his fibula while walking down his stairs with a suitcase. If he is anything like Lucy Bronze, he will be back in no time., 13:B - It’s certainly an interesting time to be a Luton fan. They have played in all four tiers of the League Football – League Two, League One, the Championship and Premier League – in the last eight years. , 14:C - He surfed 4,097 waves in 253 sessions over 25 days at a wave pool in Sydney. , 15:B - Zayas is 22; Benítez was just 17 when he won the first of his three world titles. </p>
