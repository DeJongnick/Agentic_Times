<p>Parenting in London can often be defined by “don’ts”, says Jen Ablitt, 48, who has a four-year-old daughter – “don’t touch that, stop there, don’t run”.</p> <p>But whenever they go camping in the countryside, she finds, for a city kid it’s a completely different realm. “Off they go, and you give them more freedom,” she says.</p> <p>Ablitt is one of many people taking a camping or caravanning holiday this summer, options that tend to be significantly cheaper than some other breaks while providing benefits such as proximity to nature.</p> <p>Camping and caravan holidays <a href="https://www.visitbritain.org/media/4672/download?attachment">work out cheaper</a> than other domestic accommodation types. With 62% of UK adults saying they’re currently spending cautiously or cutting back due to the cost of living crisis, according to the <a href="https://www.visitbritain.org/media/4965/download?attachment">British Tourist Authority</a>, cheaper holiday options are increasingly attractive.</p> <p>Dozens of people responded to a Guardian callout asking for their experiences of UK camping holidays. Here are some of their affordable tales of pitching up and switching off.</p> <h2>‘I don’t think I’ve ever met a little kid that doesn’t love camping’</h2>    <p>I was recently made redundant, and hopefully I’ll get a new full-time job, so this might be the last summer holiday where I can spend the entire six weeks with my daughter, who’s four.</p> <p>I rented our home out online and planned nearly three weeks staying with friends and camping: the Forest of Dean, the Peak District, the Lake District and north Wales. We camp a lot anyway – and started when she was 18 months old – so we’re used to it. I don’t think I’ve ever met a little kid who doesn’t love camping.</p> <p>We’ve had a very cheap holiday – about £20 a night – more than paid for by the home rental money. But as a solo parent it has been exhausting to do all the driving, packing, camping, parenting, interspersed with house guest changeovers.</p> <p>Overall, I’m very glad I did it. Camping is a terrific way to see some truly gorgeous parts of the UK. <strong>Jen Ablitt, 48, south-west London</strong></p> <h2>‘I watched the children uncurl’</h2>    <p>I went camping for the first time in the Lee Valley this August – three mums and six kids – to try to give our city kids a taste of outdoor living, off their phones and out into nature. They’re teenagers, and most of them are glued to screens.</p> <p>We had looked at a few seaside holiday lets, but the prices – one place was £1,000 a week – were just too high. Cost was definitely a factor. It feels like UK seaside holidays are getting out of reach, whereas the campsite cost £140, including equipment hire, for two nights per family. It was camping for softies – none of us have camping equipment or tents, so we got to experience it without the stress of bringing endless bits.</p> <p>Only one of us has a car, so she drove with the luggage, and the rest of us got the train, which was only 20 minutes. We then walked 45 minutes along the River Lea to the campsite. It was brilliant that it wasn’t far.</p>    <p>There were the initial complaints from the kids: “How long is this walk going to take? There’s no toilet in the tent. It’s cold at night. The shop doesn’t sell any good snacks.”</p> <p>It took about 24 hours, but I watched the children uncurl, and by the end of our stay they were all out playing frisbee, making fires, going on river walks, watching the ducks and climbing trees to get apples. <strong>Rebecca Lovell, small business owner, east London</strong></p> <h2>‘On clear nights you could see the Milky Way’</h2>    <p>This summer, I’ve reacquainted myself with low-tech camping and had two glorious weeks in Dumfries and Galloway. My family prefer more comfort and also have less spare time, so I went solo.</p> <p>I stayed at a family-owned farm campsite, which is in the Galloway Dark Sky area and close to lots of interesting attractions.</p> <p>This is my happy place. Each day was an early rise, including watching an uninterrupted sunrise on Midsummer Day from my tent. Most days I cycled around the quiet roads and trails. On clear nights you could see the Milky Way and millions of stars.</p> <p>For £17 a night, I got my pitch, free hot water and showers, a freezer for ice packs, and mains electricity to charge my phone and electric bike. It was amazing value and I had a great reception from the owners.</p> <p>The carbon footprint of these holidays was tiny: two cans of butane gas a week and 50 litres of petrol. The weather was kind, but then being retired I could pick my weeks to take advantage of the sunshine.</p> <p>As a solo holiday, there were many other folks around to chat with and share tips. I think these are the best holidays I can remember. <strong>Nick Norton, 70, retired business analyst, Glasgow</strong></p> <h2>‘Camping offers the opportunity to be close to nature’</h2>    <p>We took our two children to Coniston Water in the Lake District camping, We’re keen paddleboarders and kayakers. It did not disappoint and was only a two-hour journey from our home.</p> <p>We all enjoyed the water, with spectacular views. We played ball games on the camping pitch, made a lovely campfire under the stars and toasted marshmallows. Our children also enjoyed the brilliant tree swing each day. It was absolutely perfect, and all for £34 a night.</p> <p>As a family, we have enjoyed holidays to France, Finland, Scotland, Tunisia, Spain and Cornwall. Each holiday is unique so it’s hard to say how our camping trip compares, but we had just as much fun in the Lakes and felt really connected as a family.</p> <p>Camping offers the chance to be close to nature, and it is a great learning experience for children. We love that these kinds of holidays build character and resilience.</p> <p>Other holidays, you can end up fretting about a missed departure, getting lost or wondering whether you can afford to eat out. But when we got home from camping, we felt refreshed and relaxed. <strong>Rachel Hardy, teacher, northern England</strong></p>
