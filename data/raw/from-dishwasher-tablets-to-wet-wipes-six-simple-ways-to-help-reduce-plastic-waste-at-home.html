<p>According to a 2025 <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01447-3/abstract" rel="nofollow">report</a> by the medical journal the Lancet, global plastic production is continuing to grow at record levels – with 475m tonnes produced in 2022, compared with 2m tonnes in 1950. The fact is, there is still demand for everyday plastic products. Left unchecked, plastic production is projected to grow to 1,200m tonnes by 2060 – gravely impacting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/03/world-in-15tn-plastics-crisis-hitting-health-from-infancy-to-old-age-report-warns">our health</a> and contributing to the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/plastics" rel="nofollow">climate crisis and pollution</a>.</p> <p>There are solutions, however, to combat this growing problem – and if enough of us make more conscious choices towards which products we buy, we could make a world of difference. Leading brands such as Ecover have made it easier to reduce our individual plastic use. Here are six ways to help you use less plastic at home.</p> <p><strong>Wash up wiser<br></strong>Ecover’s <a href="https://uk.ecover.com/products/dishwashing/wrapper-free-all-in-one-zero-dishwasher-tablets/#:~:text=Our%20wrapper%20free%20ZERO%25%20ALL,free%2C%20fragrance%2Dfree%20dishes." rel="nofollow">Zero wrapper-free dishwasher tablets</a> come with a special plastic-free coating that keeps them protected against breakage and moisture. The tablets with biodegradable formula – which contain no phosphonates or fragrance – are the best way to give your plates a thorough clean without any tastes, scents or plastics being left behind. If you do your dishes by hand, Ecover’s <a href="https://uk.ecover.com/ecover-products/dishwashing/" rel="nofollow">range</a> of washing-up liquids come in 450ml and 950ml refillable bottles – with 5-litre and 15-litre refill options available online and at supermarkets. Opt for a hard-wearing wooden dish brush as an alternative to mass-produced microplastic-based sponges, and quality cotton dishcloths that can be used again and again.</p> <p><strong>Better storage<br></strong>For the Tupperware hoarders among us, the move to being plastic-free might sound daunting – but it’s actually pretty effortless. As your old containers become unusable, replace them with glass jars – old jam jars do the trick (and are great at keeping food fresh), while larger jars are available at most household product retailers. Wrapping food, such as cheeses, in beeswax wraps, rather than clingfilm, will preserve aroma and taste too.</p>    <p><strong>Buy in bulk<br></strong>One of the most effective ways to minimise plastic waste at home is to buy in bulk – whether it’s condiments or toiletries. Not only does purchasing in bulk help reduce the amount of packaging waste, but it also often leads to saving money in the long-run. By buying in bulk, you can cut down on the number of individual plastic bags, containers and packaging that you would otherwise accumulate.</p> <p><strong>Revamp your bathroom essentials<br></strong>If you can master a plastic-free bathroom, you can master pretty much anything. Start by swapping out single-use plastic products, such as disposable razors and dental floss – there are bamboo-based options that are far more sustainable. Refillable <a href="https://uk.ecover.com/ecover-products/personal-care/" rel="nofollow">hand soaps</a> and shower gels are also all the rage right now.</p> <p><strong>Ditch the wet wipes<br></strong>While the UK government is in the process of implementing a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-wide-ban-on-wet-wipes-containing-plastic-to-be-put-into-law" rel="nofollow">ban on wet wipes</a> that contain plastic, scientists argue that even some so-called “biodegradable” wipes aren’t designed to break down easily – meaning they still hold the qualities of plastic that block pipelines, sewage systems and pollute our oceans. So why not ditch the wet wipes and get on board with other alternatives such as reusable cloths?</p>    <p><strong>Repair, reuse, recycle<br></strong>Nothing supports a plastic-free lifestyle better than buying high-quality products that are made to last. Reusing items for as long as possible and opting to repair them where you can, saves tonnes of waste. If you do need to replace things, consider shopping secondhand or make the swap to a plastic-free alternative. Always prioritise products – from food to homeware – that haven’t been wrapped in single-use plastic packaging.</p> <p>Bear in mind that only <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2022/02/plastic-pollution-is-growing-relentlessly-as-waste-management-and-recycling-fall-short.html" rel="nofollow">9% of all plastics are successfully recycled</a>. Rigid plastics – which are usually marked with a triangle and numerals 1 and 2 – are typically recyclable. Anything flimsier such as bags, straws and cutlery (if you still have some) – or with a numeral higher than 2 – aren’t generally recycled.</p> <p><em><strong>Find out more about reducing waste<br></strong>Ecover’s perfectly packed Zero dishwasher tablets are designed to reduce waste.
