Wall Street has led the charge, helped by the boom in tech stocks which continued over the last 12 months.</p> <p>Investors in the UK stock market have enjoyed gains too – the blue-chip <strong>FTSE</strong> <strong>100</strong> index is on track to record a 5% rise this year, broadly in line with the European average.
