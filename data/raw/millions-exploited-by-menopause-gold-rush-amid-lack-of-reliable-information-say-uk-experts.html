<p>Millions of women are being exploited by a “menopause gold rush” as companies, celebrities and influencers take advantage of a “dearth” of reliable information on the issue, experts have said.</p> <p>Healthcare companies and content creators saw menopause as a “lucrative market” and were trying to profit from gaps in public knowledge, women’s health academics at University College London (UCL) said.</p> <p>Researchers called for the rollout of a national education programme after finding a significant number of women do not feel well-informed about menopause.</p> <p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20533691251372818">Writing in the medical journal Post Reproductive Health</a>, they said: “There has been a rapid expansion in unregulated private companies and individuals providing menopause information and support for profit; this has been termed the ‘menopause gold rush’.</p> <p>“This fragmented landscape of menopause support and education leaves people vulnerable to financial exploitation, may propagate misinformation and is likely to amplify existing menopause-related health inequities.”</p> <p>One woman who took part in the UK study told researchers: “Everything I know about the menopause I learnt on Instagram from other women.” Only one in five – 22% – of 1,500 women surveyed by the UCL team felt well-informed about menopause.</p> <p>Nine in 10 women surveyed said an education and support programme was needed. The preference would be a service to be delivered in person or online in weekly sessions over two to four weeks, they told researchers.</p> <p>Those surveyed said the acceptability and success of such a programme would be dependent on it being accessible, accurate and based on the latest scientific evidence. It would also help with “myth busting”.</p> <p>The UCL team has begun developing a training programme that could help women prepare for menopause and support those experiencing symptoms. These can include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/26/ignoring-hot-flushes-is-wrong-study-challenges-assumptions-about-perimenopause-symptoms">physical symptoms such as hot flushes</a>, palpitations and difficulty sleeping, and mental symptoms including brain fog and mood changes.</p> <p>The lead author of the study, Prof Joyce Harper, from UCL’s Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women’s Health, said: “We have a menopause gold rush because companies, investors and people see menopause as a lucrative market.</p> <p>“While <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/17/perimenopause-symptoms">public awareness of menopause</a> has greatly improved recently, there has been a rapid expansion in private companies and individuals providing menopause education, especially on social media, which has led to misinformation which can make existing menopause-related health inequities worse.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/27/feel-it-in-your-bones-taking-the-pain-out-of-osteoporosis">Feel it in your bones: taking the pain out of osteoporosis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There remains a dearth of evidence-based, theoretically informed and rigorously evaluated public health programmes targeting individuals around the time of menopause and immediately afterwards. Hence our proposal for a new national programme of menopause education and support, which we hope will be funded by the government.”</p> <p>The senior study author Dr Shema Tariq, of UCL’s Institute for Global Health, said: “Although menopause is a natural hormonal and social shift, without evidence-based information and support it can be a challenging time for people. Menopause often comes at a ‘crunch point’ in our lives – we may be juggling multiple caring roles as well as the demands of work, and potential impacts on our self-esteem and relationships.</p> <p>“We believe that everyone should be entitled to accurate information and support networks, free of charge, so they are better able to navigate this stage of life.”</p>
