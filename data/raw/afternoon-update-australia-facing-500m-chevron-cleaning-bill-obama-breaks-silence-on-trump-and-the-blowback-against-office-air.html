<p>Good afternoon. The Australian government faces <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/23/barrow-island-western-australia-taxpayers-chevron-oil-wells">having to pay hundreds of millions of dollars</a> to the American oil and gas company Chevron to help it clean up oil wells on Barrow Island, in Western Australia, under a deal made in the 1980s.</p> <p>The WA government also faces a hefty bill – estimated to be $129m – to help repair an offshore nature reserve where about 900 wells have been drilled over the past six decades.</p> <p>Chevron says it has paid more than $1bn in royalties – about $3 a barrel – for oil and gas extracted from beneath the island, which is about 70km off the state’s north-west coast. Under state legislation written especially for the project, federal and state taxpayers will have to pay them back nearly half that amount to help cover remediation costs.</p> <h2>Top news</h2> <ul> <li><p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/23/asio-compulsory-questioning-powers-to-become-permanent-despite-warnings-from-human-rights-advocates">Asio’s 9/11-era questioning powers to become permanent despite warnings from human rights advocates</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/23/labor-reforms-to-strip-childcare-centres-of-funding-after-one-safety-breach-strike-ntwnfb">Labor puts childcare centres on notice after abuse scandal with ‘one strike’ threat to funding</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/22/obama-breaks-silence-trump">Obama breaks silence on Trump’s ‘outrageous’ call to prosecute him</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/23/sunday-school-teacher-jailed-for-sexually-abusing-nine-children-protected-by-church-leader-victorian-cult-inquiry-hears-ntwnfb">Sunday school teacher jailed for sexually abusing nine children protected by church leader, Victorian cult inquiry hears</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/23/daily-telegraph-headline-about-labor-and-hamas-breached-accuracy-rules-australian-press-council-finds-ntwnfb">Daily Telegraph headline wrongly claiming ‘Labor backs Hamas’ breached accuracy rules, Australian Press Council finds</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/22/afp-news-agency-calls-on-israel-to-allow-evacuation-of-its-freelance-contributors">AFP news agency calls on Israel to allow evacuation of its freelance contributors</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/ukraine-war-comedy-anton-tymoshenko-russian-invasion-aoe">‘War is very funny for the first couple of years’: how Russia’s invasion transformed Ukraine’s comedy scene</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>In video</h2>    <p>Behind closed doors at a New York City federal building, people are confined after being seized by officers on their way out of immigration court on the 12th floor. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/22/ice-videos-new-york-trump">This rare look inside</a> Donald Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown shows one of several rooms from which accounts have emerged of people being detained in unsuitable conditions with few basic provisions.

McCormack was responding to Liberal MP Dan Tehan, who had earlier compared McCormack and Barnaby Joyce to “two steers in a paddock” after one former leader backed the other’s push to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/11/barnaby-joyce-vows-to-wind-back-net-zero-private-members-bill-australia">repeal net zero by 2050</a>.
