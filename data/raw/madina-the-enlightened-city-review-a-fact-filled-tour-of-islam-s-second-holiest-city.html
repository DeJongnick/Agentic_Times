<p>Here is a tour guide of the Islamic holy city best known in the UK as Medina in Saudi Arabia, a major destination for religious tourism, second only to Mecca. It is home to Islam’s first mosque, and the prophet Muhammad’s final resting place. For anyone planning a visit, this documentary about the city’s sacred sites is well worth a watch. Non-Muslims may find themselves reaching for their phones to look up terms and historical events.</p> <p>There is an antiquated, mildly academic feel to the voiceover, like a BBC documentary from the 1970s. It begins with a brief overview of the prophet’s migration from Mecca to Medina in 622AD, marking the start of the Islamic calendar. In the present day, the faces of pilgrims are a window into the significance of this spiritual journey for those with faith – but none are actually interviewed.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZHQxmbEfNo"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xZHQxmbEfNo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The main focus of the film is a tour of the city’s landmarks: mostly mosques, but also a gleaming state-of-the-art Qur’an printing facility that produces 8m copies a year. Breathtaking aerial footage shows off the wonders of the sites, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet%27s_Mosque">Prophet’s Mosque</a>, which has 250 incredible giant umbrellas that open to create a translucent roof over the courtyard when the temperature goes above 30C.</p> <p>There is an overly informational quality to some of the film, with the narrator listing details about the car-parking facilities of one mosque and opening times of the reading room in another. But some of these facts are admittedly astounding: it takes a staff of 6,000 to keep the Prophet’s Mosque spotless.</p> <p>• Madina: The Enlightened City is at Cardiff Odeon on 4 July, then tours</p>
