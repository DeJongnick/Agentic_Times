<p>Human rights organizations on Thursday denounced the visit by the US homeland security secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kristi-noem">Kristi Noem</a>, to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/20/trump-deportations-venezuela-prison">notorious prison</a> in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/el-salvador">El Salvador</a> that is holding hundreds of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuelans</a> deported from the US earlier this month without a hearing, calling her actions “political theater”.</p> <p>Critics condemned Noem’s visit as just the latest example of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s aim to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/25/trump-deportation-state-secret">spread</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/trump-signal-chat-middle-east-opinion">fear</a> among <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/20/trump-food-stamps-snap-school-lunch-immigration">immigrant</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/trump-revoke-legal-status-cuban-haitian-nicaraguan">communities</a>, as the cabinet member stood in a baseball hat in front of a line of caged men bare from the waist up.</p> <p>Noem visited the so-called Cecot, or Terrorism Confinement Center, an infamous maximum-security prison. The prison, built in 2022 during a brutal government crackdown on organized crime, is where nearly 300 migrants, previously in US custody, were recently expelled and are currently detained.</p> <p>They have been accused of being violent gang members, despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/19/venezuelan-deportations-families-trump">family members</a> of several of the men <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/20/deported-because-of-his-tattoos-has-the-us-targeted-venezuelans-for-their-body-art">asserting</a> that they are not.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/20/deported-because-of-his-tattoos-has-the-us-targeted-venezuelans-for-their-body-art">‘Deported because of his tattoos’: has the US targeted Venezuelans for their body art?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The Department of Homeland Security secretary’s visit is an example of the fear that Trump’s government wants to instill in immigrants,” attorney Ivania Cruz said on Thursday. Cruz works with the Committee to Defend Human and Community Rights (Unidehc), a human rights organization in El Salvador. “This is precisely what Noem has done — use the Cecot as a cinematographic space,” she added.</p> <p>Noem’s visit to the prison “was a typical gross and cruel display of political theater that we have come to expect from the Trump administration,” Vicki Gass said. Gass is the executive director of the Latin America Working Group (LAWG), a human rights organization based in Washington DC. “That the Trump administration is flouting judicial orders and denying due process to people within the US borders is outrageous and frightening.”</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> invoked the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/16/alien-enemies-act-explainer-can-trump-apply-a-wartime-law-to-deport-gang-members">Alien Enemies Act</a>, a wartime provision that allows the executive to detain and deport people coming from an “enemy” nation. Despite a federal judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/15/trump-alien-enemies-act-deportations">blocking</a> the invocation of the act, shortly after, planes from the US landed in El Salvador, filled with men and women in immigration custody. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/16/deportation-alleged-gang-members-el-salvador">More than 250 men</a>, mostly from Venezuela, were quickly and forcibly shuffled into the Cecot, where officials shaved their heads and placed them in cells.</p> <p>Trump and his administration have repeatedly claimed that the men were members of transnational gangs. When invoking the Alien Enemies Act, Trump – without proof – accused the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua of having “infiltrated” the US at the behest of the Venezuelan government. US intelligence agencies contradict Trump’s claims about ties between the gang and the Venezuelan government, the New York Times has reported, and the Venezuelan government has also denied it is connected.</p> <p>News reports across various publications have emerged revealing the identity of the Venezuelan men expelled to El Salvador, with family members saying some of the men are innocent. When pressed, the DHS has not provided proof of those men’s purported ties to the gang and they were flown out of the US without a hearing, raising questions about violations of constitutional due process rights.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/judge-us-deportations-trump-disrespectful">federal judge</a> in Washington who blocked the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act has repeatedly pressed the Trump administration to provide information about their process to conduct the operation, also ordering “individualized hearings” for people Trump wants to expel under the act. In response, the Trump administration invoked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/25/trump-deportation-state-secret">“state secrets”</a> privilege, to avoid disclosing any information about the operation.</p> <p>The Salvadorian prison that Noem visited was constructed in 2022, during El Salvador’s “state of exception”, a move by the president, Nayib Bukele, that rounded up thousands of people in an attempt to crack down on criminal gangs. According to Cruz, the human rights attorney, and other organizations, the state of exception violated due process rights, with thousands being caught up in arrests and detention without proof of gang membership.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/25/trump-deportation-state-secret">Trump administration claims details of mass deportations are state secrets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cruz has been targeted for her work denouncing conditions in the Salvadorian prisons. During the state of exception, her brother was arrested and imprisoned by the Bukele government. Cruz fought for his release and since then, she has taken on a role as a key spokesperson for people who have been wrongfully detained in the prisons.</p> <p>“It is not by chance that the expelled immigrants are from Venezuela, when we know there is a political conflict between the two countries,” Cruz said. “Today it is Venezuelans – tomorrow may be Chileans, then Colombians. It’s an international problem that is provoking conflict.”</p> <p>Noem’s visit came one day before a protest organized by a Salvadorian rights organization, opposing the Central American government’s “arbitrary detentions”.</p> <p>“I also want everybody to know, if you come to our country illegally, this is one of the consequences you can face,” Noem said in a <a href="https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1905034256826408982">video</a> posted on X from the Cecot prison. “Know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.”</p> <p>The use of another country’s vast, maximum-security prison to detain immigrants from a third country is unprecedented, especially considering the grave allegations of abuses at this and other Salvadorian prisons.</p> <p>“Amnesty International has extensively documented the inhumane conditions within detentions centers in El Salvador, including the Cecot, where those removed are now being held,” the organization said in a <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/unlawful-expulsions-to-el-salvador-endanger-lives-amid-ongoing-state-of-emergency/">statement</a> on Wednesday. “Reports indicate extreme overcrowding, lack of access to adequate medical care, and widespread ill-treatment amounting to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.”</p> <p>According to Ana María Méndez Dardón, the Central America director for the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights non-profit in DC, there are two or three huge prisons in El Salvador where the mass incarceration of people has been concentrated. The detention centers in the country have faced extreme allegations of human rights abuses.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/20/trump-deportations-venezuela-prison">US deportees face brutal conditions in El Salvador mega-prison: ‘Severe overcrowding, inadequate food’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The Cecot has a capacity for 40,000 people, that is to say only 30% of the current prison population, the rest of the population is located in other centers, such as the one in Mariona, where torture and other human rights violations have been documented,” Méndez Dardón said.</p> <p>She added: “Unlike the videos edited and produced about Cecot, President Bukele is not showing the world the true reality within the other detention centers, where the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has stated that they have committed torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment.”</p> <p>Reports have described bare metal bunks stacked high like shelving and with no bedding whatsoever.</p> <p>The Trump administration’s practice of denying due process and defying judicial orders “is outrageous and frightening”, Gass, from LAWG, added. “So is forcibly disappearing them to Cecot where prisoners are not allowed to meet with lawyers or their family members, are jammed into overcrowded cells, and never see the light of day.”</p>
