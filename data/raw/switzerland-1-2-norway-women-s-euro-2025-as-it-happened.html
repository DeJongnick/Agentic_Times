The sheer presence of Ada Hegerberg dug them out of a hole, and never mind the penalty miss that kept the game live until the very last kick. She barged through a porous Swiss defence to equalise, then spooked Julia Stierli into conceding an own goal. Switzerland will wonder how they came away with nothing – the excellent Géraldine Reuteler hit the crossbar, had a fine shot saved, and missed a sitter – but when it’s not your day, it’s not your day. Once the sting of defeat subsides, though, they should take succour from a very creditable opening performance. They’ll hope for better luck against Iceland on Sunday; Norway will hope to perform a little better against Finland. Here’s how Group A looks after the first day …</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>1.

Norway on the other hand are past masters: champions in 1987 and 1993, and runners-up four other times. But the word past is instructive there: Norway, erstwhile World and Olympic champions as well, aren’t the force they once were, having failed to get through the groups at the last two Euros – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/jul/11/england-v-norway-womens-euro-2022-live-score-updates">remember </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/jul/11/england-v-norway-womens-euro-2022-live-score-updates">that</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/jul/11/england-v-norway-womens-euro-2022-live-score-updates"> 8-0 defeat to England three years ago?</a> – and falling to their current Fifa ranking of 16th in the world, the joint-lowest mark in their history. So while Switzerland, ranked 23rd, may be very much second best historically, there’s not so much of a gap between the countries right now.</p> <p><strong>Having said all that, Norway will still fancy their chances this afternoon.</strong> They’ve beaten Switzerland twice already this year, in the Nations League, while the Swiss are six without a win in competitive matches. The hosts, who are without the injury-stricken Ramona Bachmann, will look to Arsenal midfielder Lia Wälti for inspiration; Norway have plenty of star power up front in Caroline Graham Hansen and Ada Hegerberg. Can the hosts get off on the good foot, or will Norway rediscover their mojo? <strong>Kick-off is at 8pm UK time.</strong> It’s on!</p> </div>   </div>
