<p>Fierce winds, pounding rain and high seas battered Hong Kong as Super Typhoon Ragasa headed into southern China after causing a lake to burst in Taiwan, killing at least 14 people. </p> 
<p>Hong Kong experienced widespread damage on Wednesday, including fallen trees and flooding in many areas, with the storm surge smashing the glass doors of an upmarket hotel and flooding its lobby, according to footage circulating online.</p> 
<p>Ragasa was gradually turning away from Hong Kong around noon (0400 BST) but the city will still be lashed by hurricane-force winds, according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which issued the highest level of typhoon warning overnight.</p>

<p>Ragasa has brought “significant storm surge”, with waters at coastal areas rising more than 3 metres above the reference level, the observatory added.</p> 
<p>Macau, which also experienced widespread flooding, has suspended power supply to some low-lying areas, according to the utility company CEM.</p> 
<p>In Taiwan, at least 14<strong> </strong>people were killed and 18 injured when a decades-old lake barrier burst in the eastern Hualien county after Ragasa pounded the island, regional officials said. The death toll was revised down from 17 on Thursday. The fire department said 33 were missing. </p> 
<p>The super typhoon killed at least two people while ripping through the northern Philippines.</p> 
<p>China’s ministry of emergency management said the typhoon was expected to make landfall along Guangdong’s coast between Zhuhai and Zhanjiang from midday to late Wednesday.</p> 
<p>Authorities across mainland China ordered businesses and schools to close in at least 10 cities across the south of the country, affecting tens of millions of people.</p> 
<p>Residents in high-rise buildings in Zhuhai have been ordered to evacuate, with some people moving into nearby hotels for shelter.</p> 
<p>China’s marine authority issued its highest red wave warning, the first time that such an alert has been triggered this year.</p> 
<p>Streets were mostly empty as wind picked up on Wednesday morning in Yangjiang, a city west of Hong Kong near where the typhoon was expected to make landfall.</p> 
<p>A local shopkeeper told AFP she was not sure if she would be able to open her convenience store. “It will depend on the weather conditions,” she said.</p> 
<p>The Yangjiang train station – normally bustling with activity – stood empty, with rail travel suspended on Wednesday across the province of Guangdong.</p> 
<p>Multiple districts in Hong Kong experienced flooding, according to images circulated on social media and verified by AFP.</p> 
<p>At the Fullerton Ocean Park hotel, next to a theme park, a man was seen losing his balance after a storm surge shattered the glass front doors and swept into the hotel lobby, one of the videos showed.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for the hotel said they were “doing all we can to mitigate the impact brought about by the super typhoon”.</p>

<p>Flood waters rushed into the seaside Heng Fa Chuen residential estate and covered its interior courtyards, another video clip showed.</p> 
<p>Strong winds ripped off the top of a pedestrian footbridge, while many of the city’s tall buildings swayed and rattled in the harsh winds.</p> 
<p>An off-duty firefighter, Tse, said he was “a bit worried” about the safety of nearby bamboo scaffoldings as he walked home after an 11-hour shift of “non-stop” work.</p> 
<p>Benjamin Phizacklea, a 27-year-old chef, said: “This one was forecast to be quite bad so we were expecting a bit of chaos … but everywhere seems to be functioning quite efficiently still.” </p>

<p>The rail operator MTR said train services on open sections were suspended, with limited service available on the underground sections.</p> 
<p>Authorities said more than 760 people sought refuge at the 50 temporary shelters across Hong Kong.</p> 
<p>The city’s airport operator said only a limited number of cargo flights were scheduled for Wednesday, with its website listing hundreds of cancelled passenger flights.</p> 
<p>A five-year-old boy and his mother fell into the sea on Tuesday afternoon while they were watching the waves in the Chai Wan district, police said. Both were in critical condition in hospital. The boy’s father, who reportedly jumped into the water to save his family, was also treated in hospital.</p> 
<p>Terence Choi, a Hong Kong resident, said he had stocked two days’ worth of food at home, adding that he was “quite nervous” about the prospect of the housing estate losing power and fresh water supply.</p> 
<p>Yang Lee-o, who has lived in the coastal neighbourhood of Lei Yue Mun for 40 years, said government workers had spent a day placing sandbags.</p> 
<p>Hong Kong’s No 2 official, Eric Chan, previously said Ragasa would pose a “serious threat” comparable to the super typhoons of 2017 and 2018, which caused hundreds of millions in property damage.</p> 
<p>Scientists say storms are becoming more powerful as the world warms owing to climate breakdown.</p> 
<p>Shenzhen, a tech hub in China’s south-east, earlier ordered the evacuation of 400,000 people and instructed residents “do not go out casually”, with the exception of emergency rescue personnel and those ensuring people’s livelihood.</p> 
<p>Other cities in the southern province of Guangdong that are implementing the measures include Chaozhou, Zhuhai, Dongguan and Foshan.</p>
