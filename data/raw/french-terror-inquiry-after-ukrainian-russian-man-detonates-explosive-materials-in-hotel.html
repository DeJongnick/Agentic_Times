<p>French anti-terror prosecutors have launched an investigation after a Ukrainian-Russian man detonated explosive materials in a hotel room north of Paris.</p> <p>A source at the French anti-terrorism prosecutors office (PNAT) said that on Monday night the 26-year-old man was given medical treatment by fire officers in a hotel in the Val-d’Oise, north of Paris, for “significant burns after an explosion”.</p> <p>An initial search of his hotel room led to the discovery of “products and materials intended for the manufacture of explosive devices”, the source said. The man, of Ukrainian and Russian nationality, was still being questioned by police on Wednesday night.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/28/france-assesses-paris-olympics-threat-in-light-of-moscow-attack">France assesses Paris Olympics terrorist threat in light of Moscow attack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The source confirmed that the PNAT, working with France’s domestic spy agency, had opened an investigation into the man, who was suspected of participating in a terrorist conspiracy and bomb plot.</p> <p>It is not clear at this stage if the man is suspected of acting alone or in a group.</p> <p>The suspected is reportedly from the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, part of which has been occupied by pro-Russian and Russian forces since 2014.</p> <p>Another source, who asked not to be named, told the AFP news agency that he appeared to have a “pro-Russian attitude” after fighting “for two years for the Russian army”.</p> <p>The Ukrainian and Russian embassies in Paris did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, which is close to where the man was arrested, said operations had not been affected.</p> <p>France is on maximum threat alert with less than two months to go until the start of the Paris Olympics.
