It was previously suggested that the first engagement in September was a one-off.</p> <p>Johnson previously broke Acoba rules when he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/17/boris-johnson-flouts-commons-rules-after-return-to-newspaper-column">failed to declare a column from the Daily Telegraph</a> after leaving office as foreign secretary.</p> <p>However, there are no formal sanctions for a breach of the rules, leading to accusations that Acoba is a toothless watchdog.</p> <p>Johnson also gave a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/02/boris-johnson-hails-blockchain-possibilities-at-singapore-conference">speech to a conference on blockchain</a>, the technology behind cryptocurrency, in Singapore in December but his earnings from this engagement have not yet been declared.</p> <p>He accepted the accommodation from the Bamfords despite part-owning three other homes, in Oxfordshire, London and Somerset. The Bamford family also contributed more than £23,800 towards the Johnsons’ wedding celebrations over the summer.</p> <p>He has previously declared more than £11,000 of hospitality in the US from Rupert Murdoch, plus almost £20,000 of hospitality from Heathrow airport for use of its royal suite.</p> <p>The earnings were declared in the latest House of Commons register of interests. The declaration also revealed that Rishi Sunak received three more donations for his November campaign to be leadership of the Conservative party. These include £2,000 from James Diner, an asset manager, £4,000 from a Mark Futter, and £2,000 from Dr Selva Pankaj, the owner of Regent Group, a private education company.</p>
