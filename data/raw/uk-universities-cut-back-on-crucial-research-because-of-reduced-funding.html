<p>Universities are cutting back on vital research, with world-leading work on deadly conditions such as cancer and heart disease under threat from an erosion in funding from government and charities, according to a report.</p> <p>The report, <a href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/sites/default/files/uploads/Research-at-risk-impacts-of-financial-constraints-on-UK-universities.pdf">compiled by Universities UK</a>, found that one in five UK universities have reduced their research activity, including cuts to life sciences, medicine and environmental sciences, and many said they were expecting to make steeper cuts in the future because of mounting financial pressures.</p> <p>Health charities are major funders of high-value medical and life sciences research – including areas such as oncology and dementia – but the report said universities “are backing away from charity-funded research” because of the additional costs involved.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/20/less-than-greggs-public-have-no-idea-of-value-of-top-universities-study-finds">Less than Greggs?

But what’s clear is that further efficiencies are not going to be enough on their own to address these broader risks to areas of research, with implications for our research system’s international competitiveness.</p> <p>“So we also need action from the government on the future of quality-related funding, which hasn’t kept pace with inflation for a decade. That’s going to be critical to restoring stability to areas of research,” Hurley said.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “Innovation fuels growth across the economy. Our £86bn for public research and development until 2030 will help the UK’s world-class universities continue to lead discoveries that improve lives for years to come.</p> <p>“While universities are independent and responsible for managing their own budgets, we are working with the sector to ensure their long-term financial sustainability. We will publish our plans for higher education reform soon.” </p>
