<p>Months after Donald Trump expressed strong negative opinions about a presidential portrait of him in the Colorado state capitol that he described as “purposefully distorted”, a White House-approved replacement now hangs in its place.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.denver7.com/news/politics/a-new-trump-portrait-donated-by-the-white-house-to-hang-in-the-co-capitol-after-the-worst-one-was-removed">new portrait</a>, which Trump reportedly demanded be printed with a golden border so it would catch the light and “glimmer”, bears a close resemblance to Trump’s official second-term photograph, which hangs in more than 1,600 federal buildings across the US and thousands more on a voluntary basis.</p> <p>The new Colorado painting – donated by the White House and painted by Vanessa Horabuena of Tempe, Arizona, according to the <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2025/06/26/donald-trump-portrait-colorado-capitol/">Colorado Sun</a> – shows a significantly older-looking Trump than the first one. It is also more glowering than his first-term photographic portrait, which presented a sunnier disposition and showed Trump standing in the Oval Office with an American flag in the background, smiling.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/kim-sajet-resigns-national-portrait-gallery-director">Director of National Portrait Gallery resigns after Trump’s effort to fire her</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both are a departure from the mugshot issued during his re-election campaign by prosecutors when he was charged with illegally conspiring to overturn his 2020 election defeat in Georgia.</p> <p>Yet another portrait, taken from a picture with his fist in the air after he survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last summer, hangs in the grand foyer of the White House, after an official portrait of former president Barack Obama was moved from the location.</p> <p>Trump, with a well-known streak of vanity, strongly objected to the original, rather jowly representation in Colorado by Sarah Boardman. He called it “truly the worst” and mused that the artist, who also painted the state capitol’s portrait of Obama (which Trump said “looks wonderful”), “must have lost her talent as she got older”.</p> <p>“Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,” Trump wrote. “I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one.”</p> <p>The oil painting, which was commissioned after the state’s former Republican senate president Kevin Grantham raised $11,000 for it, was then taken down at the request of other state Republican leaders. “If the GOP wants to spend time and money on which portrait of Trump hangs in the Capitol, then that’s up to them,” the Colorado House Democrats said in a statement at the time.</p> <p>Boardman said the base image she used had been approved by the Capitol building advisory committee.</p> <p>“My portrait of President Trump has been called thoughtful, non-confrontational, not angry, not happy, not tweeting. In five, 10, 15, 20 years, he will be another president on the wall who is only historical background and he needs to look neutral,” <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/portrait-trump-colorado-state-capitol-truth-social-distorted-1234736683/">she said</a>.</p>
