<p>1. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/01/retirement-home-alpine-spa-appleby-blue">Appleby Blue almshouse, London SE16</a><br>Witherford Watson Mann</strong><br>The traditional almshouse reinvented in a modern urban setting. Sheltered housing that gives a haven of peace around a garden court, while connecting to the busy city life surrounding the site. If only all housing for older people could be designed this way.</p> <p>2. <strong><a href="https://redconstruction.co.uk/greville-street/">Greville Street/ 8 Bleeding Heart Yard, London, EC1</a><br>Amin Taha/Groupwork</strong><br>A drab 1970s office block renovated by veiling it in versions of the facades of the older buildings it replaced, realised in brass mesh. An architectural ghost that brings back a sense of time to the site. An inspired way to reuse a building.</p> <p>3. <strong><a href="https://atelieranf.com/projects/college-road">Croydon colonnade</a><br>A</strong><strong>telier ANF</strong></p>    <p>A public route animated by three-dimensional vitreous tiles, tactile and weighty, with what their designer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/sep/10/adam-nathaniel-furman-interview-i-like-the-senses-to-be-tickled-abundance-paddington-london-bridge-thousand-streams-paolozzi-bristol-quilt-barbie-glowbule-croydon-colonnade">Adam Nathaniel Furman</a> calls a “luscious depth” of colour and crazing. Inspirations include the zigzag patterns of Durham Cathedral and the architect of Centre Point, Richard Seifert. Beautiful and delightful, a work of real craft.</p> <p>4. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/oct/22/sunspot-jaywick-sands-review-hat-projects-a-ray-of-hope-for-the-beleaguered-essex-resort">Sunspot, Jaywick Sands</a><br>HAT</strong><br>A case of doing a lot with a little, a robust and playful structure that brings much-needed employment to Jaywick Sands, Essex, which started in the 1930s as a settlement of DIY seaside holiday homes. It’s a new landmark for the resort, with the improvisational spirit of its pioneers.</p> <p>5. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/12/oxford-street-london-less-crowded-result">Wedding Cake, Waddesdon Manor</a><br>Joana Vasconcelos</strong></p>    <p>An inspired folly for the Rothschild manor of Waddesdon in Buckinghamshire. A three-tier, house-sized wedding cake clad in pink, green and blue ceramic tiles and decorated with dolphins, candles and mermaids. Because why not?</p>
