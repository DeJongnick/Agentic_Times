<p>An 82-year-old man in Pennsylvania was secretly deported to Guatemala after visiting an immigration office last month to replace his lost green card, according to his family, who said they have not heard from him since and were initially told he was dead.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.mcall.com/2025/07/18/luis-leon-allentown-grandfather-ice-guatemala/">Morning Call</a>, which first reported the story, longtime Allentown resident Luis Leon – who was granted political asylum in the US in 1987 after being tortured under the regime of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet – lost his wallet containing the physical card that confirmed his legal residency. So he and his wife booked an appointment to get it replaced.</p> <p>When he arrived at the office on 20 June, however, he was handcuffed by two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers, who led him away from his wife without explanation, she said. She said she herself was kept in the building for 10 hours until relatives picked her up.</p> <p>The family said they made efforts to find any information on his whereabouts but learned nothing.</p> <p>Then, sometime after Leon was detained, a woman purporting to be an immigration lawyer called the family, they said, claiming she could help – but did not disclose how she knew about the case, or where Leon was.</p> <p>On 9 July, according to Leon’s granddaughter, the same woman called them again, claiming Leon had died.</p> <p>A week later, however, they discovered from a relative in Chile that Leon was alive after all – but now in a hospital in Guatemala, a country to which he has no connection.</p> <p>According to Morning Call, the relative said Leon had first been sent to an immigration detention center in Minnesota before being deported to Guatemala – despite not appearing on any Ice detention deportation lists.</p> <p>Ice on Monday evening <a href="https://www.mcall.com/2025/07/21/luis-leon-allentown-grandfather-story-hoax-ice-says/">denied</a> the Morning Call story, calling it a hoax.</p> <p>Morning Call claimed it repeatedly requested confirmation and details from Ice throughout its reporting. Morning Call also claimed it was introduced to the family during a Lehigh county courthouse <a href="https://www.mcall.com/2025/07/10/lehigh-county-court-ice-agents/">protest</a> over Ice’s operations there.</p> <p>It noted the family ceased responding to its requests for clarification on Monday.</p> <p>A recent supreme court decision ruled the Trump administration could deport immigrants to other countries beside their country of origin.</p> <p>In his nearly 40 years living in the US, Leon spent his career working in a leather manufacturing plant, and raised a family. He had since retired.</p> <p>He suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and a heart condition, according to his family, who said they are planning to fly to Guatemala to see him.</p> <p>An Ice official told the Morning Call it was investigating the matter. The Guatemala Migration Institute denied that Leon was deported from the US to Guatemala.</p> <p>Morning Call <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-deportation-guatemala-chile-allentown-1599f3cfe4e2b99e50ecd9c77b6c3832">reported</a> on Sunday that Leon was recovering from pneumonia in Guatemala, according to his family, and that he arrived in Guatemala City on 1 July. According to the family, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250721154716/https://www.mcall.com/2025/07/20/ice-leon-guatemala/">reported</a> Morning Call, his phone was taken away and Ice officers kept referring to him and other detainees as “Mario.”</p> <p>• This story was updated on 21 July 2025 to include statements from DHS and the Guatemalan government.
