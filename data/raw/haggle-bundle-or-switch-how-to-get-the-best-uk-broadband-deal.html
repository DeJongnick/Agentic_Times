<h2>Slow down</h2> <p>In the age of true fibre broadband the speeds available can be tremendous – and providers often try to upsell people to expensive, higher-speed packages. One way to save money is to pay for only the speed you need. For most households a speed of 100Mbps is likely to be enough, although it depends on the number of people who will use the internet at the same time, the kinds of devices you use, whether you play online games and the services you require.</p> <p>For instance, the programmes in HD from BBC’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/help/questions/getting-started-with-bbc-iplayer/internet-speed">iPlayer stream at up to 5Mbps</a> while <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306">Netflix requires at least 15Mbps</a> for its highest-quality 4K streams. Bear in mind that any devices such as computers running updates or security cameras will take up some of the bandwidth, so add a little headroom on to your calculations.</p> <p>Watch out, though, for slow upload speeds, as many lower-cost packages can be hamstrung by these, and they are often overlooked when comparing deals. Zoom calls, for instance, require <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306">up to 4Mbps upload</a> for full quality just on their own while Ring cameras need <a href="https://ring.com/gb/en/support/articles/92bd2/Test-Your-Wifi-Connections">up to 2Mbps each</a>.</p> <h2>Try your current provider</h2>    <p>Many providers raise the price of your service when your contract ends and this is where haggling can pay off.</p> <p>“Some providers have a reputation for being more willing to haggle to keep your business, but this can vary depending on your length of contract, previous service issues, what you want from your next deal and other factors,” says Max Beckett from the comparison site Uswitch. “Your bargaining position will be stronger near the end of your contract as you can leave for another provider, which your current one will naturally want to avoid.”</p> <p>Use price comparison sites to see what other deals are available and then ring or chat with your provider. Tell it you are looking for better value on your current service, say that the price it is asking is simply too much and ask what is the best deal it can offer.</p> <p>Be polite at all times, but don’t take the first offer at face value. Say you are thinking of quitting your contract or switching to another provider. This will lead to you being transferred to a customer retention team that typically has the power to offer the best deals to keep you from leaving.</p> <p>If you don’t get an acceptable deal on your first attempt you don’t have to commit there and then. Say you will have to talk it over with the other members of your household, then try again at another time or via another contact method if your provider has multiple routes, such as online chat as well as phone support or via social media. Consider upgrading or downgrading your speed, which may reduce your costs, particularly if your provider has an incentive to move customers to newer plans or technology.</p> <p>Note that some, including Virgin Media, are moving away from human operators offering the best deals and provide better prices via their automated online accounts instead. Check for renewal deals a couple of months ahead of time and see if they improve as the end of your contract nears.</p> <h2>Switch the account holder</h2> <p>If your current provider won’t give you a better deal and there are no other options, another member of your household can take out a new contract to bag introductory deals.</p> <p>Simply cancel your broadband contract and have them apply for a new one at the same address. The snag is that you may have some down time. Some providers allow new connection orders at the same address once the existing subscriber has given notice to cancel their plan, switching over at the day of termination. But others only open up to new contracts at an address after the existing service has ended.</p> <h2>Move to a new provider</h2> <p>Switching to another company is a good way of getting a better deal if multiple providers serve your address. The <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-and-broadband/switching-provider/simpler-broadband-switching-is-here/">One Touch Switch service</a> should make sure you have a minimum of downtime between your old and new provider automatically, though it is a relatively new service which has had some teething problems.</p> <p>Check the <a href="https://bidb.uk/">Better Internet Dashboard</a> or <a href="https://labs.thinkbroadband.com/local/postcode-search">Local Broadband Information</a> by ThinkBroadband to see which providers are likely to be available. Use comparison sites such as Uswitch, Comparethemarket, Confused or similar to see what offers are available. Check cashback sites for money back or voucher offers and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/jan/29/pick-the-right-card-and-mix-and-match-how-to-get-the-best-out-of-cashback-deals">other cashback services</a>, such as those provided by credit cards.</p> <p>Note that comparison or cashback sites do not include local fibre providers, which may offer cheaper connections, and that big providers may also offer different deals to customers who go direct.</p> <h2>Change to a social tariff</h2> <p>If you receive certain government pension, universal credit or other benefits you may be entitled to a social tariff, which is a lower cost plan made available by some providers from as little as £12 a month.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bt.com/broadband/home-essentials">BT</a>, <a href="https://help.nowtv.com/article/now-broadband-basics">Now</a>, <a href="https://www.sky.com/help/articles/sky-social-tariff">Sky</a>, <a href="https://www.virginmedia.com/broadband/low-income-families">Virgin</a> and <a href="https://www.vodafone.co.uk/broadband/essentials-broadband">Vodafone</a> offer social tariffs nationally, with varying eligibility requirements and speeds available. Some local providers, <a href="https://www.hyperoptic.com/broadband/home/price-plans/social-tariff-broadband/">such as Hyperoptic</a>, also offer social tariffs so it is worth looking around for the best speed and deals.</p> <h2>Bundle with phone, mobile and TV</h2> <p>If you also have a home phone, mobile phone, pay-TV or other services, bundling them with your broadband can work out much cheaper than paying for them all separately. It simplifies your various connections to one bill and can offer faster speeds for less money than broadband on its own.</p> <p>But bundling removes some of the flexibility for switching should you ever want to, and narrows your options to the main providers. Be careful that you don’t end up taking out more services than you need through upselling.</p> <h2>Or hang up the landline</h2>    <p>Modern broadband does not need a phone line any more, so if you no longer use your home phone then buying internet without it can save you as much as £30 a year in line rental plus the cost of your calling plan depending on your current package.</p> <h2>Use your own router</h2> <p>Some broadband packages include a charge for a wifi router system, particularly those that promise “whole-home wifi” or similar, with multiple wifi nodes that mesh together to spread your internet over a larger area.</p> <p>Buying your own wifi system can work out cheaper than paying for one from your service provider over the long term. Mesh systems capable of covering most homes start at about £100 and can replace or be plugged into your existing router easily. You may also get better coverage and faster wifi speeds.</p> <h2>Switch to 5G/satellite</h2> <p>If your fixed-line providers are limited, expensive or slow, 5G or satellite broadband might offer an alternative.</p> <p>Broadband over 5G is delivered using the same signal as your phone, but using a router inside your house. It is only available in certain areas and requires strong signal to work reliably, but EE, Three and Vodafone all offer the service, with the cheapest plans starting at £21 a month.</p> <p>Multiple <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/05/amazon-aims-to-branch-into-uk-internet-market-with-satellite-broadband-plan">satellite broadband</a> providers operate in the UK, offering fast services to places others can’t reach. Brdy has some of the cheapest plans starting at £29.90 a month while Starlink starts at £75. Both providers can have fairly hefty setup or equipment costs, depending on the plan. Speeds can reach up to 200Mbps, but satellite broadband has higher latency than fixed-line – that is, it takes longer for it to respond – and so may not be suitable for online gaming and similar usage.</p>
