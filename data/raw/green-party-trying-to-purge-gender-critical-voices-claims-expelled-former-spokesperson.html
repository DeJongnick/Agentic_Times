<p>The Green party is veering away from its founding culture towards a more leftwing authoritarianism, its former health spokesperson has claimed.</p> <p>Dr Pallavi Devulapalli said trans rights had become an obvious totem in the new climate, and accused the party of trying to purge anyone with gender-critical views.</p> <p>Devulapalli, a GP and member of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk council, was expelled from the party for a rules breach that she has said was due to her beliefs on gender. Her expulsion this month, she said, has exposed a rift in the party’s leadership on transgender issues that threatens to widen during this summer’s leadership election.</p> <p>The party’s current co-leader Adrian Ramsay, who has argued that members should not be thrown out for saying trans women are not women, is pressing internally for Devulapalli’s expulsion to be reviewed.</p> <p>A Green party spokesperson said: “We don’t comment on individual cases.”</p> <p>Devulapalli was suspended last September, three months after she failed to back the party’s manifesto policy on the <a href="https://greenparty.org.uk/about/our-manifesto/defending-human-rights-democracy-and-justice/">right of self-identification for trans people</a> during a hustings event. Last week she was informed she had been expelled from the party after attending what Devulapalli said she thought was a social gathering, but which a disciplinary panel deemed was an official party event from which she was banned because of her suspension.</p> <p>Devulapalli said the move was a “pretext” to get rid of her. She said: “They don’t like my stance on trans self ID and the trans women policy. They didn’t come out and say that so they expelled me on a technicality.”</p> <p>She added: “It feels like a purge. We’ve seen the Greens veer away from its original founding culture towards a much more leftwing authoritarian culture. If you say or think the wrong thing then you’re out – that’s really worrying.”</p> <p>Devulapalli is now one of 25 “<a href="https://greensinexile.org.uk/meet-the-exiles">Greens in Exile</a>” – former party members who have been suspended or expelled largely for their gender critical views. Last year a court found the party had removed Dr Shahrar Ali as a party spokesperson in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/09/green-party-incorrectly-sacked-spokesperson-over-trans-rights-views-court-rules">procedurally unfair way</a> that discriminated against him because of his gender critical belief. In 2021, Ali’s position as spokesperson is understood to have prompted Siân Berry, now an MP, to quit as co-leader.</p> <p>Devulapalli said the party’s belief that trans women are women was “peddling a falsehood”, adding: “It denies science and denies reality and alienates the Greens from the vast majority of voters who know the truth when they see it.”</p> <p>Following April’s supreme court ruling that a “woman” in the Equality Act refers only to a biological woman, the Greens’ policy has come under strain. In interviews since, Ramsay, who is standing again as co-leader with fellow MP Ellie Chowns, has refused to commit to an answer, but Carla Denyer, who is standing down as co-leader, has said that <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/green-party-co-leader-denies-split-over-trans-rights-13355566">“trans women are women [and] trans men are men”</a>. Zack Polanski, a leadership challenger, is campaigning on the slogan “trans rights are human rights”.</p> <p>Devulapalli fears that if Polanski wins, the party will become more “authoritarian” and less tolerant of gender critical views as it tries to appeal to disillusioned Labour supporters. She said: “A lot of members have said they will leave the party if he’s elected. People are trying to reclaim the Greens back to being a party of democratic values and science.”</p> <p>Since her expulsion Devulapalli says she has had dozens of messages of support, including from fellow GPs and prominent Greens such as the party’s former candidate for London mayor <a href="https://x.com/greenjennyjones/status/1932368254900842537?s=46&amp;t=_Hhp2Jc9TMhfEi5N7nBNSA">Jenny Jones</a> and another former Green party <a href="https://x.com/sanders4health/status/1932485983284375738?s=46&amp;t=_Hhp2Jc9TMhfEi5N7nBNSA">health spokesperson, Larry Sanders</a>, who called for <a href="https://x.com/sanders4health/status/1932485983284375738?s=46&amp;t=_Hhp2Jc9TMhfEi5N7nBNSA">“debate not expulsion”</a>.</p> <p>Devulapalli said accusations of transphobia, which she denies, had contributed to a culture of fear within the party. “People are afraid of being bullied online and being cast out of the party. But speaking up calmly, rationally and with compassion is important.” </p>
