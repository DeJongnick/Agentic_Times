<p>Over the past decade, the United States has turned technologies into tools that strengthened our economy, delivered good-paying union jobs, cleaned up our air and water, conserved our precious natural resources, and saved families money all across our country. Yet now the country is choosing to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e51744d9-e585-4622-91f9-e1f57c0269d9">cede that leadership, letting China</a> dominate and control the clean-energy market across the world. It’s no surprise that people are scratching their heads, wondering what happened.</p> <p>Our president is obsessed with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels">fossil fuels</a>. He wants to resuscitate what everyone knows is a dying coal sector while turning a blind eye to the health, environmental, and economic downsides of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis">climate crisis</a>. Coupled with inconsistent threats of increased tariffs against virtually all our allies, he has isolated the US and amplified threats to global security.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s giant budget bill, signed right before the horrific floods in Texas, North Carolina and New Mexico, ignores threats to communities from escalating climate risks while it cuts healthcare, raises energy costs, and puts the safety of our loved ones in harm’s way. And the administration’s executive orders, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history">Environmental Protection Agency announcements</a>, and efforts to gut our federal workforce make it abundantly clear our federal leaders are not working for the American people.</p> <p>But I have never been one to back down from a challenge, certainly not when it comes to protecting my kids and grandkids. And I am not alone. Millions of Americans across the country have no intention of letting this administration dictate our fate at home or abroad. We simply refuse to let this be the United States of America.</p> <p>States and institutions are still fighting in court when this administration disregards science and weakens federal efforts to protect people and our environment. Folks are still listening and speaking up at neighborhood gatherings, town hall meetings, and public hearings on issues such as the weakening of air, water and power plant pollution rules that increase risks to families. They are still fighting for our lives, our communities and our democracy.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/03/trump-us-immigration">The US immigration system is being militarized. Now is the time to stand up | Kica Matos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>States, cities and local communities have authority to act boldly and work with industries to advance market innovation and install clean energy that creates jobs and lowers the cost of living for families. They still have clean vehicle fleets for cities to purchase and EV charging projects to pursue. They still have tax credits for solar, wind and batteries. There’s more than a decade of geothermal and battery storage tax credits available for cities, schools and health clinics, as well as many more clean energy opportunities we can and must grab.</p> <p>California, the fourth largest economy in the world, ran on clean energy for 219 days last year. Florida built more large-scale solar infrastructure than California last year. Even in oil country, Texas is setting records for solar, wind and battery capacity.</p> <p>More than 40 states have green banks and clean energy financing institutions. Twenty-four states are committed to the goals of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement">Paris climate agreement</a>. They’re developing bilateral climate partnerships with countries that understand the threat of the climate crisis and the opportunity that clean energy provides.</p> <p>US leaders I have worked with for decades during international climate negotiations continue to work with colleagues in the United Nations, the European Union, India, China, development banks and the private sector to identify policies and strategies that allow the world to mobilize capital for climate projects. Why? Because the cost of not investing in resilience and decarbonization is far too high.</p> <p>Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies have given our country a seat at the global table. America Is All In, partnering with the US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors, Ceres and others, will be at the forthcoming UN climate negotiations in Brazil to showcase leadership on infrastructure, transportation, buildings, land use and more that protects our communities and cuts pollution.</p> <p>Mayors and governors will use this platform to inform negotiations, build new partnerships, and pursue creative financing for more projects at home, while US investors continue to explore opportunities to address the heartbreaking food and water challenges across the global south.</p> <p>Eighty-four per cent of corporations are <a href="https://intelligence.generatecapital.com/looking-beyond-the-headlines-of-corporate-decarbonization/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&amp;stream=top">standing by their commitments to cut carbon pollution, and 37% are increasing</a> their ambitions, according to PwC, because they know that climate solutions are good for business. The first quarter of 2025 <a href="https://cleanpower.org/resources/clean-power-quarterly-market-report-q1-2025/#:~:text=ACP's%20Q1%202025%20report%20finds,%2410%20billion%20in%20domestic%20investment.">was the second-strongest ever</a> for US clean energy, representing $10bn in domestic investments. Across the globe, <a href="https://www.pv-tech.org/iea-clean-energy-investment-to-hit-us2-2-trillion-in-2025/#:~:text=Investment%20in%20clean%20energy%20and,International%20Energy%20Agency%20(IEA).">investments in clean tech are slated to reach $2.2tn this year</a>, twice the amount for coal, gas and oil.</p> <p>To stay competitive, meet rising energy demand, stop utility bills from soaring, and tackle aging infrastructure, we need more clean energy, battery storage, and energy efficiency, not less. These technologies are cheaper to build and operate than fossil fuels. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/19/trump-clean-energy-cuts-wind-solar-power/85624752007/">Ninety-three per cent of new electric-generating capacity</a> this year is projected to come from solar, wind and batteries, according to Trump’s own energy department.</p> <p>Facts are facts. No matter how much the administration tries to prop up the fossil fuel industry, US states, cities, communities, businesses and institutions know that the world is not as Trump defines it. Clean energy is and must be our future.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gina McCarthy is the managing co-chair of America Is All In, former White House national climate adviser and 13th US EPA administrator</p></li> </ul>
