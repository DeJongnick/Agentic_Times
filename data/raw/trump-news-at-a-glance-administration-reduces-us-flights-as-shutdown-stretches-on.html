<p>As the record-breaking federal government shutdown stretches toward day 38, US airspace is about to get a little less busy. The same cannot be said for US airports.</p> <p>Donald Trump’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said flights are being reduced to maintain air traffic control safety during the federal government shutdown, now the longest recorded and with no sign of a resolution between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> to end the federal budget standoff.</p> <p>Airline regulators identified “high-volume markets” where the FAA says air traffic must be reduced by 4% by 6am ET on Friday, a move that would force airlines to cancel thousands of flights and create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the nation’s largest airports.</p> <p>Trump’s transportation chief, Sean Duffy, wrote on X Thursday that the decision was “not about politics” but rather “about assessing the data and alleviating building risk in the system as controllers continue working without pay”.</p> <p>“It’s safe to fly today, tomorrow, and the day after because of the proactive actions we are taking,” Duffy added.</p>  <h2>US airlines cancel flights after federal directive to cut air traffic</h2>  <p>Experts predict hundreds if not thousands of flights could be canceled. The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by the aviation analytics firm Cirium.</p> <p>The affected airports covering more than two dozen states include the busiest ones across the US – including Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver, Dallas/Fort Worth, Orlando, Los Angeles, Miami and San Francisco. In some of the biggest cities – such as New York, Houston and Chicago – multiple airports will be be affected.</p> <p>All three airports serving the Washington DC area – Washington Dulles international, Baltimore/Washington international and Ronald Reagan Washington national – will be affected, inevitably causing delays and cancellations for lawmakers as well as other travelers.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/us-40-airports-traffic-reduced"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>US supreme court allows Trump to block passport sex markers for trans and non-binary people</h2>  <p>The supreme court on Thursday allowed Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and non-binary people from choosing passport sex markers that align with their gender identity.</p> <p>The decision by the high court’s conservative majority is Trump’s latest win on the high court’s emergency docket, and it means his administration can enforce the policy while a lawsuit over it plays out.</p> <p>The court’s three liberal justices <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/25a319_i4dj.pdf">dissented</a>, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson calling the decision a “pointless but painful perversion”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/supreme-court-ruling-passports-transgender-trump"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>US judge orders Trump administration to fully fund Snap benefits in November</h2>  <p>The ruling by US district judge John J McConnell Jr on Thursday was in response to a challenge from cities and non-profits complaining that the administration was only offering to cover 65% of the maximum benefit. The government said it will rely on $4.65bn on emergency funding.</p> <p>“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund Snap,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial Snap payments and failed to consider the harms individual who rely on those benefits would suffer.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/ruling-snap-benefits-funding-trump"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Workers decry Trump officials as ‘out of control’ as longest shutdown drags on</h2>  <p>As the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2025/2025/nov/03/all">US federal shutdown</a> enters its second month, government workers are accusing the Trump administration of being “out of control” and bullying people who are “simply trying to do their best”.</p> <p><a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-shutdown/2025/10/feds-told-shutdown-furloughs-extended-to-late-november/#:~:text=Congress%20failed%20to%20pass%20a,a%20partisan%20or%20political%20message.">About 700,000 federal employees</a> are furloughed without pay, and about 700,000 additional federal workers have been working without pay through the shutdown.</p> <p>Affected workers say the shutdown has been a continuation of attacks they have experienced under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>, from mass firings – many of which have been overturned or blocked in federal courts – to drastic budget cuts, pushes to take early retirements or resignation buyouts and threats of withholding back pay for workers furloughed during the shutdown.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/trump-federal-government-shutdown"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Nancy Pelosi, a force on Capitol Hill for decades, to retire from Congress</h2>  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> Democratic representative and the first woman to serve as speaker, announced on Thursday she will retire from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress">Congress</a>, two years after stepping down from House leadership.</p> <p>Even when no longer in leadership, the 85-year-old remained enormously influential among <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a>, quietly counseling her party as they navigate Trump’s second term.
