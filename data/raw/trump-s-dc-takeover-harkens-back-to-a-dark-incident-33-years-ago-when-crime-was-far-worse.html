<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s takeover of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc">Washington DC</a>’s police department and decision to deploy the national guard was sparked by the assault of a former Doge staffer who nicknamed himself “Big Balls”. Thirty-three years ago, a fatal attack on a congressional staffer also provoked an effort by the federal government to impose law and order on the nation’s capital – but in that case, it came from Capitol Hill.</p> <p>On Monday, Trump said he was taking “a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we’re going to take our capital back.”</p> <p>In 1992, it was the death of 25-year-old Tom Barnes, a staffer for Senator Richard Shelby, a Democrat of Alabama, that prompted the senator to introduce legislation to legalize the death penalty in the district. Shelby, a conservative Democrat who would <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/11/09/Shelby-switches-to-Republican-party/5726784357200/">become a Republican two years later</a>, acknowledged that many DC community leaders had historically been opposed to the death penalty, but argued that the tide had changed – using similar dystopian language as Trump.</p> <p>“The terror that comes with living in a war zone has prompted many residents to reconsider the appropriateness, ethically and legally, of a death penalty,” Shelby wrote in a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1992/03/08/fighting-back-in-murder-city/2f4bf8e2-db30-462a-b773-5eccb059e6e4/">March 1992 Washington Post op-ed</a>. “… People are using guns to settle arguments about clothes and girlfriends. They are ‘smoking’ others because they feel like it. They will even ‘bust a cap in you’ if they don’t like the way you look at them.”</p> <p>In announcing the police takeover on Monday, Trump cited the attack on Edward Coristine, who <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2110me5g4o">he said</a> was “savagely beaten by a band of roaming thugs” and was “left dripping in blood”. He also referenced the June slaying of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, an intern for the Republican representative Ron Estes, of Kansas, who was killed by crossfire in a drive-by shooting. Last week, his mother, Tamara Tarpinian-Jachym, told ABC News <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/murdered-congressional-interns-mom-trump-washington-dc/story?id=124445454">that she supported Trump’s idea of a federal takeover</a>, which he had threatened in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114977985620971126">social media post</a>.</p> <p>There was one key difference between then and now: Trump is painting an exaggerated picture of crime in DC, where <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/violent-crime-dc-hits-30-year-low#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%2D%20Total%20violent%20crime%20for,Graves.">violent crime is at a 30-year low</a>. But back in January 1992, Washington really was a crime-plagued city. It was coming off a year that saw 482 murders in 1991, earning it the ignoble title of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28605215">the murder capital of the US</a>. By contrast, there were 187 homicides last year and the city is on pace for a lower number this year.</p> <p>According to the book Dream City: Race, Power, and the Decline of Washington DC by Harry Jaffe and Tom Sherwood, Barnes, the Shelby staffer, left his home on a Saturday night in January 1992 to go to the corner store to get coffee grounds for the next morning. A group of teenagers approached him and demanded his money or they’d “put a cap” in him. “Leave me alone,” Barnes replied, and turned up the street. One of them shot him in the head, landing him in a coma. He died four days later, marking the 22nd homicide of the new year.</p> <p>A Capitol Outrage, ran the headline on a Tuscaloosa News<em> </em>editorial two days later. “Beset by drug-related violence,” the newspaper declared, “Washington has become a national disgrace, an American embarrassment.”</p> <p>“Tom’s death was the catalyst for my involvement in trying to find solutions to the violent crime that plagues our city,” said Shelby, who had known Barnes since he was a toddler.</p> <p>His bill to impose the death penalty on DC failed, but he did get Congress to vote to force the city to hold a referendum on that fall’s ballot asking Washingtonians to authorize capital punishment. “The criminal justice system is out of control in this city and Congress is not going to turn its back on this issue,” Shelby said. Even some home-rule champions on the Hill voted with Shelby, such as Leon Panetta, a Democratic representative from California.</p> <p>“I really think the District of Columbia ought to handle its own affairs,” said Panetta, who would go on to serve as chief of staff to Bill Clinton, CIA director and defense secretary. “But crime continues to be a very serious problem in the district. Part of it is the urban crisis that is part of every city’s social and economic problems. But I don’t get the sense that the district has a strong commitment to confront this issue.”</p> <p>The DC council had repealed the death penalty in 1981, but the last execution in Washington took place in 1957, years before the city won home rule in 1973.</p> <p>This week, Washington leaders bristled at Trump’s takeover of the police. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a non-voting delegate representing DC in the House of Representatives, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/trump-washington-dc-crime">called it</a> “an historic assault on DC home rule”, while the mayor, Muriel E Bowser, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/11/trump-presidency-news/">described it</a> as “unsettling and unprecedented”.</p> <p>There was a similarly visceral reaction to Shelby’s death penalty referendum.</p> <p>“There is something approaching rage among the voters of the district about their disempowerment, about Congress forcing this on us,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/01/us/issues-of-race-and-home-rule-confound-death-penalty-vote-in-washington.html">said Norton</a>, who was in her first term in Congress at the time. “When you mandate a death penalty vote, you engage that issue directly.”</p> <p>Leading up to the referendum, dozens of ministers denounced it at Sunday sermons, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/11/04/district-rejects-death-penalty-measure/bac30807-80a5-4278-98ad-7a1416938596/">Washington Post reported</a>.</p> <p>On 3 November 1992 – the same day Democrat Bill Clinton won his first presidential election – Washingtonians rejected the death penalty referendum by a 2-1 margin.</p> <p>“Today the voters sent a powerful message to every member of the US Congress that we are citizens of this country,” the then mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, said after the vote, while Norton said the vote showed the city “will not tolerate this interference from the outside”.</p> <p>But the climate of fear around crime had won some support for capital punishment.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/mayor-dc-trump-national-guard">Trump says he’ll seek ‘long-term’ control of DC police and signals he’ll target other cities next</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“In neighborhoods across the city, among rich and poor, black and white, some residents have argued that violence has become so random and brutal that convicted killers should be punished with the ultimate act of retribution, regardless of whether it serves as a deterrent,” the Post reported. But others cited concerns that it would be used unfairly against Black defendants, or didn’t like Congress interfering in the city’s affairs, in their votes against it.</p> <p>Even the city council chair, John Wilson, who supported the death penalty, urged a no vote as a signifier of DC’s independence. (Today, the city hall is named for him.)</p> <p>“It’s not that they didn’t favor the death penalty,” Jaffe and Sherwood wrote of DC voters. “Many black Washingtonians are quite conservative, law-and-order advocates … They just resented a white senator from Alabama telling them that they needed a death penalty to make their streets safe.”</p> <p>Today, there is definitely some resentment at a white president from New York who says he wants to clean up the city streets. And Bowser is using it as a way to rally support for the long-held goal of DC statehood.</p> <p>“My message to residents is this: we know that access to our democracy is tenuous,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/11/trump-presidency-news/">she said at a news conference</a> after Trump’s takeover. “That is why you have heard me and many, many Washingtonians before me advocate for full statehood for the District of Columbia. We are American citizens. Our families go to war. We pay taxes, and we uphold the responsibilities of citizenship.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Frederic J Frommer, a writer and sports and politics historian, has written for the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Atlantic, History.com and other national publications</p></li> </ul>
