       " 'final_draft': '# Elon Musk\\'s $1 Trillion Salary: A Leap into the Future of Corporate Compensation\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is a prominent figure in the technology and business world, celebrated for his ambitious vision and transformative impact on multiple industries. Recently, discussions have surged around Musk potentially earning a historic $1 trillion salary—an extraordinary benchmark in corporate compensation that reflects not only his influence but also the evolving landscape of executive pay. This ambitious compensation package is intrinsically linked to Tesla\\'s remarkable journey and continued growth, raising questions about the sustainability and ethics of such substantial rewards in today\\'s corporate environment.\\n\\n## Section 1: Understanding Elon Musk\\'s Compensation Package\\n\\n### 1.1 The Breakdown of the $1 Trillion Package\\n\\nMusk\\'s colossal salary is part of a groundbreaking compensation strategy that is primarily performance-driven. Designed to incentivize exceptional growth and innovation at Tesla, the package is structured around ambitious milestones that Musk must achieve within a designated timeframe. Following a historic shareholder vote, over 75% approved this unprecedented compensation plan, recognizing Musk\\'s unique ability to lead Tesla into a future dominated by artificial intelligence and robotics [[source: Tesla shareholders approve $1tn pay package for Elon Musk]].\\n\\n### 1.2 Historical Context of Corporate Compensation\\n\\nSuch a staggering salary wouldn\\'t just set a record in Musk\\'s favor; it would also redefine the standards of corporate compensation worldwide. Historical comparison reveals that even previous high-value packages, such as those awarded to top tech executives, pale in comparison to the potential $1 trillion salary Musk is in line to earn. With the backdrop of Silicon Valley\\'s pay packages, where figures like Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google have garnered attention for their multi-million dollar salaries, Musk\\'s case represents an unprecedented leap toward a new era of corporate incentives [[source: How Tesla shareholders could make Elon Musk the world’s first trillionaire]].\\n\\n## Section 2: The Road to $1 Trillion\\n\\n### 2.1 Growth Milestones for Tesla\\n\\nFor Musk to realize the full extent of this compensation package, Tesla must achieve ambitious growth milestones. The shareholders\\' expectations dictate that Tesla\\'s market capitalization needs to soar to upwards of $8 trillion, a remarkable increase from its current standing. Achieving such targets will depend on expanding production, increasing sales, and potentially leading the electric vehicle sector into the ages of artificial intelligence and autonomous technologies [[source: How Tesla shareholders put Elon Musk on path to be world’s first trillionaire]].\\n\\n### 2.2 The Role of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics\\n\\nMusk\\'s vision extends beyond vehicles; the integration of AI and robotics is anticipated to play a critical role in driving Tesla\\'s value over the next decade. Musk has positioned Tesla\\'s future products, like the autonomous Optimus robots, at the forefront of this evolution, predicting they could become integral in sectors as diverse as healthcare and manufacturing. This innovative approach may not only fulfill performance milestones but could also reshape entire industries, underscoring why investors maintain their faith in Musk\\'s leadership [[source: Tesla shareholders approve $1tn pay package for Elon Musk]].\\n\\n## Section 3: Investor Confidence in Musk\\n\\n### 3.1 Shareholder Dynamics\\n\\nThe backing Musk received from shareholders was not merely a vote of confidence; it highlighted the belief in Musk\\'s capacity to generate extraordinary corporate growth. Despite considerable public scrutiny and challenges, investor sentiment remains robust, illustrated by the overwhelming approval at the shareholder meeting. One vocal investor even stated, \"Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk,\" reflecting a shared belief in his pivotal role in the company’s narrative [[source: Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk]].\\n\\n### 3.2 The Impact of Public Perception and Conduct\\n\\nHowever, Musk\\'s public persona isn\\'t without controversy. His conduct and statements have sparked strong reactions that have complicated Tesla\\'s relationship with consumers and investors alike. While some believe his forthright approach has harmed the brand, others argue that the innovative advancements he drives outweigh these distractions. Thus, the balance between public perception and stock value remains a dynamic aspect of Tesla\\'s growth story [[source: Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk]].\\n\\n## Section 4: Implications of a $1 Trillion Salary\\n\\n### 4.1 Economic and Social Perspectives\\n\\nMusk\\'s potential $1 trillion salary raises critical questions about corporate governance and social equity. Comparisons to national economies reveal that this compensation, if realized, would exceed the GDP of entire countries, presenting a stark contrast to public welfare funding. The implications for economic and social perceptions could ignite debates about fairness and corporate responsibility in an age where wealth inequality is a pressing concern [[source: Tesla shareholders approve $1tn pay package for Elon Musk]].\\n\\n### 4.2 Future Trends in Executive Compensation\\n\\nShould Musk successfully achieve the performance milestones outlined in his package, it may set a precedent influencing compensation structures across industries. The validation of such enormous payouts could signify a broader shift towards performance-based compensation, prompting discussions about appropriate benchmarks and corporate accountability in the tech sector and beyond.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nElon Musk\\'s journey towards a potential $1 trillion salary is not just a reflection of his personal ambition but also a testament to the innovative spirit driving Tesla and the technology industry at large. This unprecedented compensation could redefine executive pay structures, prompting corporations worldwide to reconsider how they reward leadership. As we look to the future, the balance of innovation, ethical considerations, and economic impact will be paramount in shaping Musk\\'s legacy and the narrative of corporate compensation.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- \"Elon Musk becomes first person with net worth of $500bn\"\\n- \"How Tesla shareholders put Elon Musk on path to be world’s first trillionaire\"\\n- \"‘Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk’ – why investors are happy to pay him $1tn\"\\n- \"How Tesla shareholders could make Elon Musk the world’s first trillionaire\"\\n- \"Tesla shareholders approve $1tn pay package for Elon Musk\"',\n",

Musk owns a 42% stake in SpaceX.</p> <p>Tesla shares fell early this year, hit by a combination of the competitive threat from Chinese rivals, falling sales and doubts over Musk’s focus on the company, amid distractions from his other businesses and his tempestuous relationship with Donald Trump. Musk’s vocal support for Trump and expression of rightwing political views on X, the social media platform he owns, have also damaged Tesla sales, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/08/major-brand-worries-just-how-toxic-is-elon-musk-for-tesla\">according to analysts</a>.</p> <p>However, Tesla shares have climbed this year as investor sentiment improved on Musk bringing his focus back to his companies.

After the votes were in, Musk took the stage and danced after the news was announced.</p> <p>“It’s not just a new chapter for Tesla,” Musk said. “It’s a new book.”</p> <p>The package’s approval demonstrates shareholders’ confidence that the billionaire Musk can lead the car company into an era dominated by artificial intelligence and robotics. If denied, Tesla had risked possibly losing a leader who once made the company name synonymous with electric vehicles.</p> <p>Musk’s status as the world’s first trillionaire, however, will depend on delivering the lofty milestones in the compensation plan. To do so, he’ll need to guide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla\">Tesla</a> to $8.5tn in market capitalization, eight times what it’s worth today. He will also be required to deploy millions of autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots and sustain the company’s bottom line in the hundreds of billions over the next decade.</p> <p>So where do Musk, and Tesla, go from here?</p> <h2>The path to $1tn </h2> <p>The major goals of the compensation plan lay out a path for Tesla to reach the enormous market capitalization.</p> <p>The required milestones are separated into a dozen “tranches”, each with their own compounding goals. The first milestone, or tranche, requires reaching market capitalization of $2tn. The next nine each require an additional $500bn in growth until $8.5tn is reached by 2035. With each financial milestone also comes a product development requirement.</p> <p>To earn an additional 12% of the company’s stocks over the next decade, Musk must also deliver 20m of Tesla’s electric vehicles to buyers, 10m active full self-driving subscriptions, 1m humanoid robots, and deploy 1m robotaxis in commercial service. He will also be expected to grow the company to $400bn in actual earnings for four consecutive quarters. Actual earnings for the third quarter of 2025 were $4.2bn, down 9% from the year prior.</p> <p>At Thursday’s annual meeting, Musk described the Optimus robots, which have not yet gone into mass production, as the future of the company and of humanity. He reiterated a claim that it would be “the biggest product of all time”, and suggested they could be used in everything from healthcare to prisons.</p> <p>Ultimately, Musk must grow Tesla’s market capitalization from about $1tn today to $8.5tn by 2035. He also has to be vested in the company for at least seven and a half years and help it develop a long-term succession plan. As he grows the company’s worth, so too will he grow the value of stocks, and therefore his own wealth.</p> <p>In its proposal, the company noted that the milestones laid out “will be extraordinarily difficult and challenging for Tesla, and for Musk personally”. If these financial goals are met, it would mean Tesla would be worth nearly as much as Meta, Microsoft and Google’s parent Alphabet combined.</p> <p>Some say Musk could <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/musks-record-tesla-package-will-pay-him-tens-billions-even-if-he-misses-most-2025-10-09/\">still reap billions</a> even if he doesn’t meet all of those milestones.</p> <p>As of November, Musk’s net worth was $460bn, the highest in the world, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/\">Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index</a>.</p> <h2>Tesla’s challenges, and a new corporate home</h2> <p>The vote is a resounding victory for Musk, showing investors still have faith in him even as Tesla struggles with plunging sales, market share and profits, in no small part due to Musk himself.</p> <p>Car buyers fled the company as Musk has ventured into politics in the US and Europe and trafficked in conspiracy theories.</p> <p>The vote came just three days after a report from Europe showing Tesla car sales plunged again last month, including a 50% decline in Germany.</p> <p>Still, many Tesla investors consider Musk as a sort of miracle man capable of stunning business feats, such as when he pulled Tesla from the brink of bankruptcy a half-dozen years ago to turn it into one of the world’s most valuable companies.</p> <p>Over the years, Tesla has offered incentive-based compensation plans for its CEO, setting specific milestones in exchange for stock options.</p> <p>The last compensation package set in 2018 was challenged by a single stockholder who held fewer than a dozen shares at the time he filed a lawsuit in Delaware’s court of chancery. He won his case, and the pay package was invalidated and rescinded.</p> <p>In response, Musk railed against the court and pushed for Tesla to move its corporate home from the first state to Texas. Musk’s outspoken displeasure with Delaware court rulings has been said to have fueled #DExit, a trend in which other big-name companies such as DropBox and Meta in turn threatened to move their corporate homes from Delaware.</p> <p>“Elon Musk has a tremendous gravitational force, and that even extends to corporate law,” said <a href=\"https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/eric-talley\">Professor Eric Talley</a> of Columbia Law School. Delaware’s title as the “mecca of corporations” went largely unchallenged, he said, “until 2024, when Elon Musk tried to rally the troops”.</p> <h2>Courting a ‘superstar CEO’</h2> <p>The Tesla board chair, Robyn Denholm, had publicly warned that a no vote on the 2025 compensation plan this week could mean losing Musk as CEO.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000110465925090866/tm252289-12_def14a.htm#tECCD\">In a note to shareholders</a> signed by Denholm and board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, they said Musk “has not received meaningful compensation for eight years” due to the legal battles over the 2018 compensation plan.</p> <p>On Thursday, shareholders also approved a plan to compensate Musk for the pay package that was invalidated by a Delaware judge twice. The new incentive packages, added to his existing stake in the company, means he will ultimately own more than 25% of Tesla’s stock if he’s able to meet all of those milestones. As of 6 November, Tesla stock was trading close to its 52-week high, at about $450 a share.</p> <p>Musk’s CEO compensation exceeds the GDP of entire countries, including that of Ireland, Sweden, and Argentina. Critics of the package, including some investors, argued that awarding Musk concentrated power in one erratic leader and ignored the challenges the company has faced.</p> <p>“This vote shows how far Tesla’s governance has drifted from accountability and respect for the rights of shareholders,” New York state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a statement after the meeting. “The board has rewarded distraction and entrenched a CEO who answers to no one.”</p> <h2>Additional voting measures</h2> <p>Tesla shareholders on Thursday also supported the company’s proposals to elect three board members, approve 2024 executive compensation rates, and eliminate some “supermajority voting requirements.”</p> <p>A series of other shareholder proposals, except on one advisory measure to possibly invest in xAI that will be further reviewed by the board, were rejected. That included a proposed child labor audit across Tesla’s supply chain, related to cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>'},\n",

Shares in Tesla have risen by nearly two-thirds since May, when the Tesla chief executive announced he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/29/elon-musk-announces-exit-from-us-government-role-after-breaking-with-trump-on-tax-bill\">leaving the Trump administration</a> (and then worrying investors by falling out with the president publicly). Third-quarter deliveries – a proxy for sales –<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/02/tesla-earnings-vehicle-deliveries\"> trounced Wall Street estimates last month</a> thanks to US consumers taking advantage of expiring federal tax credits for electric vehicles, although European sales suffered and analysts warned that Musk needs to cushion a post-credit slowdown by selling cheaper models.</p> <p>Another factor is the culture among US investors of backing high-flying innovators and entrepreneurs. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg’s control of Meta has not been challenged and Jeff Bezos had a long reign at the top of Amazon before stepping down in 2021. Indeed, most Tesla shareholders seemed concerned that Musk was devoting too little time to the company, instead of wanting him to leave altogether.</p> <p>“Money talks in the US more,” says Neil Wilson, an investor strategist at financial trading platform Saxo Markets. “The US has a far more entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, go-get-’em attitude so they are inclined to let innovators innovate. Plus Musk is a one-off – without him Tesla would be nowhere.”</p> <p>Other incentives in Musk’s <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000110465925087598/tm252289-4_pre14a.htm\">$1tn pay package</a> include delivering 20m Tesla vehicles, 10m self-driving car subscriptions, 1m humanoid robots and 1m robotaxis. These targets, particularly the robots and autonomous vehicles, require the kind of entrepreneurial and technological chutzpah that Musk has shown at Tesla and his rocket company SpaceX.</p> <p>Matthias Schmidt, an automotive industry analyst, says the added value Musk has brought to Tesla’s stock is “undeniable” and has made “many people rich, including himself”.</p> <p>However, Schmidt adds that Tesla’s core car business has reached its peak and describes the autonomous vehicle plans as “certainly not the best in the market”.</p> <p>“Have shareholders been naively blind-sided by past achievements rather than the foresight of future prospects? Perhaps!” he says.</p> <p>Most Tesla investors are willing to bet $1tn otherwise.</p>'},\n",
       "  {'how-tesla-shareholders-could-make-elon-musk-the-world-s-first-trillionaire.html': '<h1>How Tesla shareholders could make Elon Musk the world’s first trillionaire</h1>\\n<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-11-06T08:00:52Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Maddy Lauria &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Technology</div>\\n<p>If Elon Musk can grow Tesla to over $8tn in value for stockholders over the next decade, he will be well on his way to becoming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/05/tesla-elon-musk-trillion-dollar-pay-package\">world’s first trillionaire</a>.</p> <p>That is if stockholders approve the company’s latest proposed compensation plan for the “Superstar CEO”, as a <a href=\"https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/09/22/superstar-ceos-and-the-limits-of-fiduciary-law/\">judge once called him</a>, at this week’s <a href=\"http://www.tesla.com/2025shareholdermeeting\">annual shareholders meeting</a> in Austin, Texas, set for Thursday afternoon.</p> <p>“If Elon achieves all the performance milestones under this principle-based 2025 CEO Performance Award, his leadership will propel Tesla to become the most valuable company in history,” the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000110465925090866/tm252289-12_def14a.htm\">company’s annual proxy statement</a> boasts.</p> <p>Forward-looking measures on Musk’s compensation of $1tn are not the only issues on the ballot. Shareholders will also consider an alternate avenue to pay Musk the estimated $56bn the company says he is still due from a 2018 compensation plan. The company is also asking shareholders to vote against several other shareholder proposals, including one that would request a child labor audit. The previous pay package was invalidated by a Delaware court twice, and with an appeal now pending in front of the state’s supreme court, the company wants to make sure Musk gets paid regardless of the outcome.</p> <h2>The path to $1tn </h2> <p>The 2025 package contains milestones beyond growing the company’s market cap.</p> <p>The required milestones are separated into a dozen “tranches”, each with their own compounding goals. The first milestone, or tranche, requires reaching market capitalization of $2tn. The next nine each require an additional $500bn in growth until $8.5tn is reached by 2035. With each financial milestone also comes a product development requirement.</p> <p>To earn an additional 12% of the company’s stocks over the next decade, Musk must also deliver 20m of Tesla’s electric vehicles to buyers, 10m active full self-driving subscriptions, 1 million humanoid robots, and deploy 1m robo-taxis in commercial service. He will also be expected to grow the company to $400 billion in actual earnings for four consecutive quarters. Actual earnings for the third quarter of 2025 were $4.2bn, down 9% from the year prior.</p> <p>Ultimately, Musk must grow Tesla’s market capitalization from about $1tn today to $8.5tn by 2035. He also has to be vested in the company for at least seven and a half years and help it develop a long-term succession plan. As he grows the company’s worth, so too will he grow the value of stocks, and therefore his own wealth.</p> <p>In its proposal, the company noted that the milestones laid out “will be extraordinarily difficult and challenging for Tesla, and for Musk personally”. If these financial goals are met, it would mean Tesla would be worth nearly as much as Meta, Microsoft and Google’s parent Alphabet combined.</p> <p>Some say Musk could <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/musks-record-tesla-package-will-pay-him-tens-billions-even-if-he-misses-most-2025-10-09/\">still reap billions</a> even if he doesn’t meet all of those milestones.</p> <h2>Courting a ‘superstar CEO’</h2> <p>Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm has publicly warned that a “no” vote on the 2025 compensation plan this week may mean losing Musk as CEO.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000110465925090866/tm252289-12_def14a.htm#tECCD\">In a note to shareholders</a> signed by Denholm and board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, they note that Musk “has not received meaningful compensation for eight years” due to the legal battles over the last 2018 compensation plan. The two board members say the milestones Musk achieved while that agreement was in place led Tesla to $735bn in increased market capitalization.</p> <p>If Musk is awarded the new compensation plan, on top of the 2018 package, he’ll ultimately own more than 25% of Tesla’s stock. As of 5 November, Tesla stock was trading close to its 52-week high, at around $450 a share.</p> <h2>How votes are shaking out</h2> <p>On 4 November, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465925106380/tm252289d48_defa14a.htm\">SEC filings</a> highlighting social media posts from Musk and others indicated that, following the advice from advisory group Glass Lewis, several <a href=\"https://thecollegeinvestor.com/67824/schwab-faces-backlash-over-etf-votes-against-elon-musks-tesla-compensation/?srsltid=AfmBOoqrERgtYdoqSFb5y_zEf7wGR9g5oX_DQ7kS1BROBPin127xYW94\">Schwab investment funds planned to vote against the $1tn pay package</a>.</p> <p>Within hours, though, the script had flipped.</p> <p>“We firmly believe that supporting this proposal aligns both management and shareholder interests, ensuring the best outcome for all parties involved,” a <a href=\"https://www.aboutschwab.com/schwab-asset-management-statement-on-tesla-proxy\">Schwab statement</a> read, noting that the investment company doesn’t solely rely on recommendations from Glass Lewis or ISS.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Norges Bank Investment Management, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund and Tesla’s seventh-biggest stockholder, announced this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/04/elon-musk-tesla-pay-deal-norway-wealth-fund-annual-shareholder-meeting\">it would vote against</a> the proposed pay package.</p> <p>“We are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution and lack of mitigation of key person risk – consistent with our views on executive compensation,” Norges said in a statement.</p> <p>In addition to current board members’ support and a deluge of messaging on the vote from Musk on his own X social media platform, others are stepping up to support the proposal. At least three other investment firms have already pledged support.</p> <p>Musk, who holds over 500m Tesla shares as its largest individual stockholder, technically can cast votes in favor of his own pay package.</p> <p>“If a controlling stockholder can vote to validate his own compensation, that would be a pretty sad commentary on accountability, I think,” said Widener University Delaware Law School professor emeritus Lawrence Hamermesh, a former corporate lawyer.</p> <h2>Tesla’s new corporate home</h2> <p>Over the years, Tesla has offered incentive-based compensation plans for its CEO, setting specific milestones in exchange for stock options.</p> <p>But the last compensation package set in 2018 was challenged by a single stockholder who held less than a dozen shares at the time he filed a lawsuit in Delaware’s court of chancery. He won his case, and the pay package was invalidated and rescinded.</p> <p>In response, Musk railed against the court and pushed for Tesla to move its corporate home from the first state to Texas. Musk’s outspoken displeasure with Delaware court rulings has been said to have fueled #DExit, a corporate trend in which other big-name companies like DropBox and Meta in turn threatened to move their company’s corporate homes out of Delaware.</p> <p>“Elon Musk has a tremendous gravitational force, and that even extends to corporate law,” said <a href=\"https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/eric-talley\">Columbia Law School Professor Eric Talley</a>. Delaware’s title as the “mecca of corporations” went largely unchallenged, he said, “until 2024, when Elon Musk tried to rally the troops”.</p>'},\n",
       "  {'tesla-shareholders-approve-1tn-pay-package-for-elon-musk.html': '<h1>Tesla shareholders approve $1tn pay package for Elon Musk</h1>\\n<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-11-06T23:14:48Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Maddy Lauria and Nick Robins-Early &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Technology</div>\\n<p>Tesla shareholders approved a $1tn compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk on Thursday, awarding the world’s richest person what would be the largest corporate payout in history if he meets the goals necessary to receive it.</p> \\n<p>The pay package, which several high-profile investors opposed, demonstrates that shareholders still believe Musk can lead the automaker in an era dominated by robotics and artificial intelligence.</p> \\n<p>The result of the vote was announced at the annual shareholder event in Austin, Texas, with more than 75% of investors voting in favor of the plan. Chants of “Elon” erupted in the room at the news of its approval.</p> \\n<p>“Thanks, guys,” Musk said, after briefly dancing on stage alongside the company’s Optimus robots.</p> \\n<p>Musk described the Optimus robots, which have not gone into mass production, as the future of the company and of humanity. He reiterated a claim that it would be “the biggest product of all time”, and suggested they could be used in everything from healthcare to prisons.</p> \\n<p>“You now get a free Optimus and it’s just going to follow you around and stop you from doing crime,” Musk said. “You don’t have to put people in prisons and stuff. It’s really wild to think of the possibilities.”</p> \\n<p>Musk had previously said he wanted the pay package for more control over the company and exert “strong influence over this robot army” that he vowed to build as the company branches into robotics.</p> \\n<p>Musk’s staggering compensation is comparative with the GDP of entire countries, exceeding that of Ireland, Sweden and Argentina. It vastly exceeds federal funding for entire government programs such as annual cost of Snap food benefits and dwarfs that of other tech moguls such as Mark Zuckerberg.</p> \\n<p>Critics of the package, including some investors, argued that awarding Musk concentrated power in one erratic leader and ignored the challenges the company has faced.</p> \\n<p>“Elon Musk just got $1tn for failure. Sales are down, safety risks are up, and his politics are driving customers away. This isn’t leadership – it’s the world’s most expensive participation trophy,” the protest group Tesla Takedown said in a statement.</p> \\n<p>If Musk delivers on the lofty milestones in the pay package laid out at the annual meeting, he could become the world’s first trillionaire. To do so, he would need to guide Tesla to $8.5tn in market capitalization, eight times what it’s worth today. He would also be required to deploy millions of autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots, and sustain the company’s bottom line in the hundreds of billions over the next decade.</p> \\n<p>The major goals of the compensation plan, split into 12 tranches, lay out a path for Tesla to reach that enormous market capitalization. If he brings the company to that financial height, Musk would be able to cash in on an additional 12% of the company’s stocks. To do so, he has to be vested in the company for at least seven and a half years. He would also have to help develop a long-term succession plan for the company he has led for more than 20 years.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/02/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package\">Elon Musk’s $56bn Tesla pay package rejected again by US judge</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>The stock options provided by the new compensation plan, on top of shares guaranteed to him in his 2018 package, would leave Musk with 25% ownership of Tesla’s stock. As of 5 November, Tesla stock was trading close to its 52-week high, at about $450 per share.</p> \\n<p>Over the course of a decade, Musk is required to deliver 20m of Tesla’s electric vehicles to buyers, sell 10m active full self-driving subscriptions, develop and sell 1m humanoid robots and deploy 1m robotaxis in commercial service.</p> \\n<p>Musk will also be required to bring the company to $400bn in actual earnings for four consecutive quarters. Tesla’s actual earnings for the third quarter of 2025 were $4.2bn, down 9% from the year prior.</p> \\n<p>As of November, Musk’s net worth was $460bn, the highest in the world, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/\">Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index</a>.</p> \\n<h2>Reviving a rescinded package</h2> \\n<p>Shareholders also approved a plan that would compensate Musk after his 2018 compensation plan was invalidated by a court in Delaware. The pay plan, worth an estimated $56bn, was challenged by a single stockholder, who won his case. The Delaware court of chancery rejected Musk’s pay package twice.</p> \\n<p>After Musk’s 2018 pay package was first rescinded, he moved Tesla’s corporate home <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/01/elon-musk-acts-to-move-tesla-legal-base-to-texas-after-pay-package-ruling\">from Delaware to Texas</a>. He followed suit with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/15/elon-musk-moves-spacex-to-texas-tesla-pay-delaware-judge\">SpaceX</a> and other companies’ headquarters. In 2024, under Texas law, shareholders once again voted to approve the pay package.</p> \\n<p>But Delaware’s so-called “court of equity” once again ruled against one of the largest CEO payouts in modern history. Following that unfavorable ruling, Muskvoiced displeasure with the state and its “<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1885742602588148173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1885742602588148173%7Ctwgr%5E86609c343551d2fec094c85ffc21b61237d06dd5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Felonmusk%2Fstatus%2F1885742602588148173\">activist chief judge</a>”, arguably fueling a series of corporate exits that Delaware lawmakers have attempted to staunch with legislation.</p> \\n<p>“He had a big megaphone,” said Lawrence Hamermesh, Widener University Delaware Law School professor emeritus and a former corporate lawyer. “I think there’s more to the movement than just Elon stirring the pot, but I think that had some effect.”</p> \\n<p>In considering whether Musk had undue influence in being awarded that 2018 pay package, <a href=\"https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/eric-talley\">Eric Talley</a>, a Columbia Law School professor, noted that the judge recognized that other “superstar CEOs” like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos were not awarded these kinds of incentive-based contracts.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.
