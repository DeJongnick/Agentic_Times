<h1>Birding is a heightened state with a strange loss of self. Once you start, it’s hard to stop</h1>

<p>When I started birding, it was daggy – that was precisely why I wanted to learn more. I wanted to do something so niche, so consuming, I could lose myself in it. I was in a funk that needed urgent lifting.</p> <p>It started as a distraction. I was battling addiction and mental illness, spending so long in clinics and therapists’ rooms my vitamin D count had bottomed out.</p> <p>In my younger days, I loved bushwalking but had no friends left to do it with. I couldn’t carry a pack anyway, as my back health was terrible due to lack of exercise.</p> <p>Somehow I heard about a weekend introduction to birds at The Briars, Mt Martha, run by Birds Australia (now BirdLife Australia).</p> <p>A wholesome course of nature studies seemed harmless enough. I could get out of the house – and my long-sleeved shirts – for a couple of days.</p> <p>I went and it was a bit, ahem, obscure. I’m ashamed to say the lengthy talks about bird taxonomy made me fidget like a child. There were slideshows, nature walks and dusty bird specimens laid out on a table in lines.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/12/birdwatching-australia-binoculars-going-birding-life">Here’s to the birdwatchers! Optimistic, slightly eccentric custodians of wonder and joy and passion and love</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spark was lit but it wasn’t very bright.</p> <p>Everything changed when I enrolled in Tafe and studied David Malouf’s novel Fly Away Peter<em>. </em>The elegiac descriptions of Jim’s response to birds ignited me:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This creature that I could catch so easily in my hands, feeling the heart beat and the strong wings flutter against my palms … has been to Siberia. Its tiny, quick eye has seen something big. A whole half of the Earth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Who could resist? I wanted to see for myself the godwits and sandpipers that poor, doomed Jim studied in the Gold Coast hinterland in 1914.</p> <p>[Sadly, some of those migratory shorebirds are in as much trouble now as a soldier in the trenches, with one species, the curlew sandpiper, dropping in number dramatically in the last 20 years.]</p> <p>So I bought binoculars and began watching birds. I frequented parks and wetlands. I got a key to Werribee’s Western Treatment Plant. I went on beginner’s outings and began climbing a learning curve that hasn’t levelled out yet.</p> <p>It’s ridiculously easy to observe birds. Like cloud spotting, you need only stay still and pay attention (you can even watch birds – or clouds – out your window).</p> <p>Suddenly shapes in the sky, on the water and in the trees take on a name and a meaning. Your perceptions expand, you “get” the bird species and a new dimension of the world is exposed.</p> <p>Pinpointing birds involves a quantum leap, a jolt of comprehension. You gaze at a branch or follow a jerky movement, twiddling the knob of your binoculars. Suddenly, you discern the bird that was there all along.</p> <p>It’s a heightened state with a strange loss of self. The more birds you recognise, the more you feel part of the natural world.</p> <p>Once you start experiencing birds, it’s difficult to stop. Your “bird radar” is never turned off. Many birders will admit to pulling over on busy roads to check out a bird of prey above, or screaming to a halt when a brolga or banded lapwing come into view.</p> <p>Above a busy Caulfield crossroad I once saw five pelicans slowly revolve in a circle, floating on the summer thermal currents. Pulling over was <em>awkward.</em></p> <p>I took to birds pretty late but now can’t remember a time when I didn’t scour the sky.</p> <p>Of course, birding is not all joy and transcendence. You can’t understand birds without learning about the conservation issues they face.</p> <p>Take the orange-bellied parrot. It may be on the road to recovery but, for a wealthy country, Australia has far too many endangered birds, many without plans for their revival (known as recovery plans).</p> <p>The critically endangered bush stone-curlew is of great significance to many First Nations peoples. According to Wurundjeri elder Aunty Joy Murphy Wandin, the bird is part of the land; when it cries, it gives a message of warning.</p> <p>We must heed the warning and step up conservation. To do that, we must care a lot more.</p> <p>I’m passionate about class <em>Aves</em> the way others love pop stars or sports teams. I swapped one addiction for another and I don’t mind at all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Debbie Lustig is a <a href="https://debbielustig123.wixsite.com/dlustig">Melbourne writer</a>, birdwatcher and occasional wildlife rescuer</p></li> </ul>
