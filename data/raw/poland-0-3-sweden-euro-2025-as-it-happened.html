This was a routine victory and, make no mistake, tougher tests lie ahead than the obstacle posed by a limited Poland. The underdogs could, and really should, have been put far out of sight before Lina Hurtig completed the scoring. Nonetheless they will top Group C if they avoid defeat against Germany and, with Stina Blackstenius and Kosovare Asllani opening their accounts either side of the break, have enough stars hitting form to sense opportunity knocking.</em></p> </blockquote> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/08/poland-sweden-womens-euro-2025-group-c-match-report">Blackstenius seals Sweden’s knockout place as victory eliminates Poland</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686d87da8f08ba9382f60036" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-08T21:06:30.209Z">10.06pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Johanna Rytting Kaneryd </strong>has been named player of the match by Uefa.

After months of anticipation, it can all be over in a matter of days – which is particularly tough on debutants. For Poland, three decades of trying but failing to reach a major finals came to an end with a surprise playoff win over Austria.</p> <p>Poland began their Group C campaign with a creditable 2-0 defeat to Germany, but with said opponents beating Denmark in Basel, Nina Patalon’s side will likely need a result against Sweden – another former champion – or see their Euros dream end, four days after their tournament began.</p> <p>Sweden, who got the better of Denmark in their opener, will start as heavy favourites but Poland have a world-class forward in Ewa Pajor, and they have overcome the odds just to be there. One result can still change everything. Kick-off is at 8pm BST, 9pm local time.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-08T18:08:49.936Z">at 7.08pm BST</time></p>  </div>
