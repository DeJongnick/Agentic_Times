The fiscal deterioration is attributed to rising recurring expenses and a decline in mining royalties and GST revenue.</p> <p>“The government plans to curtail expense growth through measures such as limiting headcount from fiscal 2027, reducing consulting costs, and finding savings such as procurement efficiencies. Successfully implementing these will be crucial to maintaining our ‘AA+’ credit rating on the state,” S&amp;P Global said.</p> <p>By 2028 the state will owe a debt to revenue ratio of 150%, up from 100% in 2023, according to the agency. It noted that the state government is undertaking a historically large amount of infrastructure spending, constructing transport and health projects and the 2032 Olympics and Paralympic Games.

<p>“We don’t necessarily think about this as a fight as much as it is a competition, but it is a very real competition, and the stakes are pretty significant,” he told an audience at SXSW Sydney this

<blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The infrastructure of the AI age is made up of the following: It’s chips, it’s data, it’s energy and it’s talent, and whichever country is more effective at marshalling those resources to maintain the competitive lead right now – the US does have that lead, it’s not insurmountable – is going to be the country that does determine whether the world is built on democratic AI or autocratic AI.</p> <p>One of the two will end up being the player that the rest of the world builds on.</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked whether he was confident that America would

It will be the first formal face-to-face meeting between Albanese and Trump, after a series of phone calls, a cancelled meeting in Canada and a brief chat in New York last month.</p> <p>The Labor government is downplaying prospects of any immediate outcomes on the Pentagon’s Aukus review, tariffs on Australia, or a mooted critical minerals deal coming during Albanese’s trip. But Ley has continued the opposition’s criticism that Albanese hasn’t met Trump before now.</p> <p>She said she’d written to Albanese saying she hoped to see an assurance on the American review of Aukus, “real commitment” on pillar two of the Aukus agreement on future technologies, a “deal” on Trump’s trade tariffs and progress on Australia becoming a supplier of advanced weapons systems.</p> <p>Ley wished Albanese well, but yet again noted “this meeting could have, and should have, occurred sooner.”</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>When it comes to the prime minister stepping into the Oval Office, there is only Team Australia.
