<h1>As thinness is idolised, eating disorders can go dangerously overlooked. Will Victoria’s new approach save lives?</h1>

<p>What would become a decade-long battle that nearly claimed her life started out “quite innocently” for Portia Michau.</p> <p>“I wanted to be the ‘healthiest’ version of me I could be and it stumbled from there,” she says.</p> <p>At 14, she began to exercise and control her diet in what she says was an attempt to “fix” her body, which had changed “quite dramatically” during puberty.</p> <p>By 18, she was exercising multiple times a day and hyperfixated on her diet. Her period stopped, she couldn’t sleep and she was always cold. Socialising became harder and eventually stopped altogether.</p> <p>Then, her heart began to slow, and she was admitted to the cardiac ward at Monash hospital in Melbourne’s south-east.</p> <p>“There was actually nothing technically wrong with my heart,” Michau says. “It was just the result of being so deficient in energy.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/29/eating-disorder-help-insideout-eclinic-australia">I had no idea where to find help for my eating disorder. Then Australia’s new e-clinic changed everything | Lucinda Price</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For a month, she was confined to a hospital bed. Michau says while doctors were treating the “side-effect” of her eating disorder, the cause was largely ignored.</p> <p>“I was basically told: ‘eat more,’” she says. “Eating was my biggest fear. There was no support or understanding of that.”</p> <p>Now, two new Victorian government-funded programs – one a world-first, the other nation-leading – are aiming to change how the public health system responds to one of the deadliest, yet most neglected, mental health conditions.</p>    <p>The Eating Disorders Intensive at Home program began accepting referrals in February, while <a href="https://www.alfredhealth.org.au/services/ngamai-wilam">Ngamai Wilam</a>, the state’s first public residential eating disorder centre, opened three months later. Both are run by Alfred Health.</p> <p>“There won’t be other places doing what we are doing here – both in the public or private space – probably anywhere in the world,” says Dr Paul Denborough, the director of Alfred Health’s infant, child and youth mental health and wellbeing service.</p> <h2>Early intervention is crucial</h2> <p>Denborough oversees the at-home eating disorder program, which is a world-first early intervention service, largely focused on 14- to 16-year-olds – the age when anorexia most commonly emerges.</p> <p>Though rare, the program has received referrals for children as young as seven, Denborough says.</p> <p>He says that because “thinness is valued in western cultures”, there isn’t “enough anxiety” when early signs appear, such as worrying about weight or diet. As a result, parents are generally “a few months behind” when it gets serious.</p> <p>But he believes eating disorders are “completely curable” if help comes fast.</p> <p>Denborough describes the at-home program as a “one-stop shop”, delivered by a team of psychiatrists, dieticians, nurses, social workers and lived experience support staff – people who’ve recovered from eating disorders, as well as relatives. </p> <p>The model, adapted from Finland’s Open Dialogue approach to mental health, involves the young person’s entire support network. Rachel Barbara-May, who works alongside Denborough on the program, says responsiveness is a key element.</p> <p>“There’s no waitlist across our entire service,” she says. “We’re often in contact within 48 hours of a referral, we provide support over the phone or in person daily. In one case, a family were having a really hard time with their young person, so we were at their home in 20 minutes.”</p>    <p>For adults needing more intensive care, there’s Ngamai Wilam. From the street, it looks like a new, modern home – not out of place in leafy Armadale. Inside, it’s a thoughtfully designed 12-bedroom treatment centre.</p> <p>Participation is voluntary, with patients committing to undergoing weight restoration – three meals and three snacks daily, each followed by support. There’s also group and one-on-one therapy.</p> <p>This level of care was previously only available in hospital. But here, patients can leave the building, stay in part-time work or study and keep parts of their daily routine going. Six similar centres are <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/70-million-for-residential-eating-disorders-treatment-centres-across-australia">planned across Australia</a>, thanks to federal funding.</p> <p>Dr Jenny Babb, who leads Ngamai Wilam and directs statewide women’s mental health services at Alfred Health, says the shift is overdue.</p> <p>“We have this history of paternalism in this space – that we do things to people,” she says. “But it’s really hard to see how that’s going to then cause behavioural change.”</p> <h2>On the rise, yet underfunded</h2> <p>In 2022, the Butterfly Foundation estimated eating disorders affected about 4% of Australians, or more than 1 million people, with about two-thirds of them women and girls.</p> <p>But the real figure could be higher – <a href="https://butterfly.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-reality-of-eating-disorders-in-Australia-2022.pdf">Butterfly’s research estimates</a> 17% of the population either have an eating disorder or show more than three symptoms of disordered eating.</p> <p>In Victoria, eating disorder presentations rose by 10% between 2008 and 2018, according to evidence presented at the state’s mental health royal commission. It climbed further during the pandemic.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Yet they remain significantly underfunded. In Australia, eating disorders receive <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanwpc/article/PIIS2666-6065(23)00104-9/fulltext">the lowest share of mental health research funding</a>, despite anorexia having the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8429328/#:~:text=Anorexia%20nervosa%20affects%20up%20to,years%20of%20the%20diagnosis1.">highest mortality rate of any mental illness</a> – in part due to starvation-related health problems but more due to high suicide rates.</p> <p>“The level of distress is quite unique because it’s always there,” Babb says. </p> <p>Part of the problem, Denborough says, is structural. Eating disorders have historically been separated from other mental illnesses, which left them siloed.</p> <p>There’s also been a lack of political will to address it.</p> <p>“Eating disorders haven’t always been treated with the seriousness they deserve,” says Victoria’s mental health minister, Ingrid Stitt. “I’ve got no doubt there must be a gendered reason behind some of this, because there’s an overrepresentation of young women.”</p>    <p>In late 2024, Stitt released Victoria’s <a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/practice-and-service-quality/victorian-eating-disorders-strategy">first statewide eating disorder strategy</a> in a decade. Backed by $31m in funding, it focuses on early intervention, improving community-based care and research and data collection.</p> <p>The strategy also calls for “media and social media standards”. Stitt is hopeful the federal government’s move to ban <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/01/how-australia-under-16s-social-media-ban-enforced-tiktok-instagram-facebook-exempt-platforms">under-16s from using social media</a> will help.</p> <p>“There’s a clear link between excessive social media use and body dissatisfaction among young people,” she says.</p> <p>While the body-positivity movement gained traction in the 2010s, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/17/the-thin-obsessed-world-is-growing-more-vicious-by-the-minute-but-fat-people-arent-going-anywhere">pendulum has swung back in recent years</a>. Thinness is again being held up as an ideal, fuelled in part by the rise of weight-loss drugs and the popularity of #SkinnyTok content (a hashtag recently blocked by TikTok for promoting unhealthy weight loss).</p> <p>“We’ve come through the gastric surgery era, and now drugs like Ozempic are the next wave,” Babb says.</p> <p>After Michau’s stay in the cardiac ward, she spent eight weeks in a hospital-based eating disorder treatment. She believes either of these new programs would’ve led her to seek help earlier.</p> <p>“I had to give up my whole life for recovery,” she says. “If these options had been available maybe it wouldn’t have been such a life-altering thing. I could’ve had gone to uni, had a job.”</p> <p>Michau is now a wellness coach and works with young women to develop a healthy relationship with food and exercise.</p> <p>“I’ve learned that movement doesn’t need to be about weight loss or punishment or making up for something, it can be a really beautiful way to celebrate who you are,” she says.</p> <p>• In Australia, the <em><a href="https://butterfly.org.au/">Butterfly Foundation</a> is at 1800 33 4673.
