<p>Donald Trump’s “liberation day” US tariffs on imported goods from a long list of international territories – including some inhabited only by penguins – sparked market turmoil and fears of a global recession.</p> <p>As the chaos continued into this week, the question loomed of how the world, from China to Europe, would respond. An increasingly dark-looking spiral with China of tariff threats and counter-threats this week led Beijing to vow to “fight to the end”, while vice-president JD Vance again showed his lack of class by referring to “Chinese peasants” in an interview.</p> <p>But Trump is also coming under growing scrutiny from his own parish, as some of his wealthy US supporters survey the wreckage of their own damaged fortunes.</p> <p>From Vietnam’s factories to Europe’s corridors of power, Guardian and Observer reporters survey the reaction to a week that some feel could be an end to globalised trade as we know it. And from the economics perspective, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/heatherstewart">Heather Stewart</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/richard-partington">Richard Partington</a> explain why the tariffs make little fiscal sense.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM53X">Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home address</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Five essential reads in this week’s edition</h2>    <p><em><strong>Spotlight</strong></em><strong> | Families’ shock at IDF’s killing of paramedics in Gaza<br></strong>Relatives who waited an agonising week before the bodies were found speak of the passion that drove Red Crescent workers. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/malak-a-tantesh">Malak A Tantesh</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/julianborger">Julian Borger</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bethan-mckernan">Bethan McKernan</a> report</p> <p><em><strong>Science</strong></em><strong> | Is ratings culture changing our brains?<br></strong>We live under mutual surveillance, asked to leave public ratings for every purchase, meal, taxi ride or hair appointment.

As a (longsuffering) fan of the club I’m delighted to hear that Johnston has taken the Shrimpers to his heart. I also offer him my sympathies. <em><strong>Neil Willis, production editor</strong></em></p> <p>• Ever wondered how a parking warden came to be the subject of the Beatles’ Lovely Rita – or, along with the Kinks, wished you could be like David Watts?
