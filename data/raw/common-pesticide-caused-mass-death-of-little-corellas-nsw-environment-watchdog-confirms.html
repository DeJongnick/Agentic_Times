<p>A common agricultural pesticide caused the mass deaths of 200 little corellas across Newcastle in March, the New South Wales environment watchdog has confirmed.</p> <p>The Environment Protection Authority said toxicology tests had detected the presence of barley grain and the pesticide fenitrothion in all the deceased birds.</p> <p>Fenitrothion is a pesticide commonly used in agriculture to control insect pests.</p> <p>An EPA spokesperson said the regulator was continuing its investigation and urged “anyone with information about the deaths or possible pesticide misuse” to come forward.</p> <p>“The EPA has been conducting a thorough investigation and will continue looking into all lines of enquiry,” they said.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>In March, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/18/newcastle-corella-birds-mass-deaths-suspected-poisoning">volunteers described “extremely confronting” scenes</a> in suburbs including Hamilton, Carrington, Waratah, Broadmeadow, Lambton and near the University of Newcastle, where dead and sick birds were found.</p> <p>Vets and volunteer wildlife carers said they did everything they could to rescue surviving, severely sick birds.</p> <p>Most of the birds were little corellas but several sulphur crested cockatoos were also affected.</p> <p>Jason Gordon, the EPA’s executive director of regulatory operations, said at the time it was a distressing situation, with affected birds exhibiting symptoms such as bleeding, staggering, paralysis and an inability to fly.</p> <p>The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) is <a href="https://www.apvma.gov.au/chemicals-and-products/chemical-review/listing/fenitrothion">currently reviewing the regulation and use of fenitrothion</a>, which is legal and, as noted by the EPA, “readily available for purchase”.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.apvma.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-04/APVMA%20Special%20Gazette%2C%209%20April%202024.pdf">a government notice last year</a>, the APVMA said it was “not satisfied” that current use instructions for fenitrothion products would protect non-target species.</p> <p>The notice said fenitrothion was toxic to birds and use of it on a range of crops and some fruit and vegetables “in accordance with currently approved instructions posed an unacceptable risk to birds.”</p> <p>In NSW, the negligent use of pesticides that harms non-target animals or plants can attract penalties of up to $500,000 for individuals and $2m for corporations.</p> <p>The EPA spokesperson said anyone with information about the deaths or possible pesticide misuse should contact the EPA on 131 555.</p>
