<p>The British journalist <a href="https://x.com/SALHACHIMI/status/1920429867071365310?t=IZFPhDZHDqy6sA3yvbhRfA&amp;s=19">Sami Hamdi</a> was reportedly detained on Sunday morning by federal immigration authorities at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco">San Francisco</a> international airport, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) says that action is apparent retaliation for the Muslim <a href="https://x.com/SALHACHIMI/status/1920429867071365310?t=IZFPhDZHDqy6sA3yvbhRfA&amp;s=19">political commentator</a>’s criticism of Israel while touring the US.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.cair.com/press_releases/breaking-cair-calls-on-ice-to-release-sami-hamdi-british-journalist-abducted-over-criticism-of-israels-genocide/">statement</a> from Cair said it was “a blatant affront to free speech” to detain Hamdi for criticizing Israel’s ongoing military campaign in Gaza while he engaged on a speaking tour in the US. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> official added in a separate statement that Hamdi was facing deportation.</p> <p>“Our attorneys and partners are working to address this injustice,” Cair’s statement said. The statement also called on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a>) “to immediately account for and release Mr Hamdi”, saying his only “‘crime’ is criticizing a foreign government” that Cair accused of having “committed genocide”.</p> <p>The press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, wrote of Hamdi in a social media <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1982514569307197749">post</a>: “This individual’s visa was revoked, and he is in ICE custody pending removal.”</p> <p>McLaughlin’s post also said: “Those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”</p> <p>During his tour, Hamdi spoke on Saturday at the annual gala for Cair’s chapter in Sacramento. He was expected to speak on Sunday at the gala for the Florida chapter of Cair.</p> <p>In London at an event in 2023 following Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel that targeted mostly civilians, Hamdi called on the audience to “celebrate the victory”. He has denied antisemitism and in a speech in 2024 in Canada he said:“No one is saying October 7 was right.” He has appeared as a commentator on news channel Sky News and other outlets.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/26/ice-detained-chicago-man-daughter-cancer">US judge rules ICE illegally detained man whose daughter is battling cancer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McLaughlin’s post about Hamdi’s detention was shared by the Trump administration ally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/who-is-laura-loomer">Laura Loomer</a>, who took credit for his being taken into custody.</p> <p>Loomer, who has <a href="https://theconversation.com/far-right-activist-laura-loomer-cements-her-influence-after-white-house-firings-253870">called</a> herself a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/trump-ally-laura-loomer-audio?CMP=twt_b-gdnnews">white advocate</a>” and a “proud Islamophobe”, has often peddled conspiracy theories such as endorsing claims that the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 were an “inside job”.</p> <p>In 2018, she <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/far-right-activist-laura-loomer-handcuffs-herself-twitter-s-new-n941891">infamously chained</a> herself to Twitter’s headquarters in New York City in protest of her account being banned. The billionaire businessman Elon Musk <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/elon-musk-reinstates-twitter-accounts-proud-islamophobe-laura-loomer-and-dirty-trickster">reinstated</a> her account after he bought the social media platform in 2022.</p> <p>“As a direct result of … my relentless pressure on the [state department] and Department of Homeland Security, US officials have now moved to take action against Hamdi’s visa status, and his continued presence in this country,” Loomer <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1982463477303189899">posted</a> on social media.</p> <p>Hamdi is the latest of numerous immigrants and travelers who have been arrested and deported by ICE over pro-Palestinian views. Earlier in October, journalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/03/journalist-mario-guevara-ice-deportation">Mario Guevara was deported</a> to El Salvador after having been detained while live-streaming the massive, anti-Trump No Kings protest in June.</p> <p>On 30 September, a federal judge appointed during Ronald Reagan’s presidency <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/30/trump-administration-immigration-palestine">ruled</a> the administration’s policy to detain and deport foreign scholars over pro-Palestinian views violates the US constitution and was designed to “intentionally” chill free speech rights.</p> <p>The ruling is bound to be appealed, possibly all the way to the US supreme court, which is dominated by a conservative supermajority made possible by three Trump appointments. The state department, meanwhile, has said it will continue revoking visas under the policy.</p>
