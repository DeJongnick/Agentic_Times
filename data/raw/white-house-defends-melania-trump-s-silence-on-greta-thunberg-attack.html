<p>Melania Trump has been silent over her husband’s attacks on Greta Thunberg after protesting a mention of her own son in an impeachment hearing because Barron Trump “is not an activist who travels the globe giving speeches”, a spokeswoman said on Friday.</p>

<p>“He is a 13-year-old who wants and deserves privacy.”</p> 
<p>Thunberg is 16.</p> 
<p>The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, also <a href="https://twitter.com/KateBennett_DC/status/1205564997012770817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fentertainment%2Fcelebrities%2F2019%2F12%2F13%2Fmelania-trump-responds-potus-attack-thunberg%2F2640897001%2F">said</a>: “It is no secret that the president and first lady often communicate differently – as most married couples do.”</p> 
<p>Donald Trump has been criticised before for his <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1176339522113679360?lang=en">tweeted criticism</a> of Thunberg. This week the Swedish climate protester, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/11/21010673/cop25-greta-thunberg-climate-change-un-meeting-madrid">in Madrid</a> for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/13/richer-nations-accused-of-stalling-progress-on-climate-crisis">COP25 summit</a>, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/11/greta-thunberg-time-magazine-person-of-the-year-2019">named Time magazine’s person of the year</a> – an accolade <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/25/donald-trump-time-magazine-incorrect">close to the president’s heart</a> after he won it in 2016.</p> 
<p>“So ridiculous,” Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1205100602025545730">tweeted</a>. “Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!”</p> 
<p>Thunberg responded in familiar fashion, changing <a href="https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg">her Twitter biography</a> to mimic Trump’s words but otherwise refraining from passing comment.</p> 
<p>In turn she was widely applauded. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/13/michelle-obama-greta-thunberg-message-support-trump">former first lady Michelle Obama</a>, for instance, told Thunberg in a tweet not to “let anyone dim your light”.</p> 
<p>“Ignore the doubters and know that millions of people are cheering you on,” Obama added.</p> 
<p>Critics, meanwhile, targeted Trump for his attacks on a 16-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/donald-trump-greta-thunberg-time-magazine">with an autism spectrum diagnosis</a> and his wife for her silence on the matter.</p> 
<p>One of the aims of the first lady’s Be Best initiative is tackling cyberbullying. The irony of such work being undertaken by a woman married to perhaps the world’s foremost online troll has been noted extensively, particularly earlier this month when the first lady reacted with anger to a witness <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/the-smoking-pun-how-an-impeachment-witnesss-joke-laid-bare-americas-divide">using her son’s name in a pun</a> in an impeachment hearing.</p>

<p>“A minor child deserves privacy,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/melania-trump-barron-trump-impeachment-hearing/index.html">Melania Trump said in a tweet</a>, “and should be kept out of politics.”</p> 
<p>The first lady told Pamela Karlan, the Stanford law professor who riffed on her son’s name to make a point about America’s lack of titled nobility, she “should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it”.</p> 
<p>In her statement on Friday, Grisham also said: “Be Best is the First Lady’s initiative and she will continue to use it to do all she can to help children.”</p>
