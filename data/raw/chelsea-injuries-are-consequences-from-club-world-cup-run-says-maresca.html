<p>Enzo Maresca believes Chelsea are paying the price for their Club World Cup exertions, with the manager without “seven or eight” players for Saturday’s visit of Liverpool.</p> <p>Cole Palmer is out with a recurring groin problem, joining the long-term absentees Wesley Fofana, Liam Delap, Levi Colwill, Andrey Santos and Tosin Adarabioyo on the sidelines, and Trevoh Chalobah is suspended after his sending-off in last weekend’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/27/chelsea-brighton-premier-league-match-report">home defeat by Brighton</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/03/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A report published by the global players’ union Fifpro this week said Chelsea’s players were given 20 days off after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/chelsea-stun-psg-to-win-club-world-cup-after-cole-palmers-cool-double">winning the Club World Cup</a> in July, and that the beaten finalists, Paris Saint-Germain, rested players for 22 days, a high workload it linked to both clubs’ injury problems.</p> <p>Maresca said he agreed with the tenor of the Fifpro report before expressing faith in the young players he will call up to stand in, with the 19-year-old Josh Acheampong expected to replace Chalobah at centre-back for his fourth Premier League start.</p> <p>“It’s reality,” Maresca said. “If PSG and Chelsea have so many injuries, probably it’s some consequences from the Club World Cup. In this moment we have four or five defenders out, but we’re going to try to adapt and find the right solution. </p> <p>“It is difficult, but at the same time we trust the ones that are here. </p> <p>For sure, when you can change one player after four or five games, it’s better. The more you play together with teammates, the relationship becomes better. Sometimes you don’t even need to speak to do something on the pitch – they understand immediately. When you continue to change it’s more difficult.</p> <p>“But I really trust the young players. Not just the young players that we buy but also the young players from the academy. We gave games last year to Josh so that shows that I trust young players.”</p> <p>Maresca was on less sure ground when claiming to be unconcerned by Chelsea’s disciplinary record, with João Pedro’s sending-off in their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/30/chelsea-benfica-champions-league-match-report">Champions League win over Benfica</a> this week their third red card in as many matches after Chalobah’s dismissal and Robert Sánchez’s in the defeat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/20/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">at Manchester United</a>.</p> <p>Since Maresca joined in June 2024, Chelsea’s disciplinary record across all competitions is the worst of the Premier League clubs, with seven red cards in 73 games, one every 10.4 matches.</p> <p>Chelsea also top the table for Premier League yellow cards under his reign, with 114, and the Italian has the second-highest card-per-game rate at one club in the Premier League at 2.7, a figure beaten by Mauricio Pochettino during his time at Stamford Bridge (2.9).</p> <p>“I don’t see any discipline problem,” Maresca said. “You have to analyse case by case. When it’s a red card for bad intention or for bad discipline, it’s different compared to the United red card or the Brighton red card. In that case, it’s just a decision that you have to take in two seconds, three seconds. Do I do foul or not? It’s difficult.”</p>
