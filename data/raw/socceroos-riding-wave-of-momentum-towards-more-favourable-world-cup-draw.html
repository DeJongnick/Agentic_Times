<p>The Socceroos will seek to build on their momentum under coach Tony Popovic and edge closer to a more favourable draw at the 2026 World Cup when they meet the United States in a friendly in Denver at noon AEST on Wednesday.</p> <p>Australia secured a seventh straight victory when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/11/australia-socceroos-v-canada-international-football-friendly-match-report">Nestory Irankunda’s goal was enough to snatch a 1-0 win over Canada</a> last Saturday and are now in line to rise to world No 24 when the Fifa rankings are next updated on 23 October.</p> <p>The Socceroos are unbeaten in their past 12 matches – including all 11 played since Popovic took the reins a year ago – while the projected rankings would place Australia in pot 2 of the draw for next year’s World Cup.</p> <p>Little separates the world No 22-25, South Korea, Ecuador, Australia and Austria, as the teams battle for a ranking that would theoretically help them avoid a tougher opponent than if they were to land in pot 3 for the draw on 6 December (AEDT).</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/11/australia-socceroos-v-canada-international-football-friendly-match-report">Nestory Irankunda steals victory for Socceroos in fiery friendly against Canada</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We want to win every game,” Popovic said. “It’s always easy to say when you don’t get the result, ‘the result doesn’t matter because it’s a friendly’.</p> <p>“That’s a throwaway line that’s easy to use. We want to keep our run going. That’s why we’ve taken on this game and we appreciate the US giving us this opportunity to test ourselves against them.”</p> <p>A win or draw against the 16th-ranked US would boost Australia’s chances of being seeded in pot 2, while the World Cup co-hosts are already assured of a place in pot 1.</p> <p>Despite the lure of a helpful World Cup seeding, Popovic refused to guarantee that captain Maty Ryan would return in goals after fellow gloveman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/oct/11/canada-vs-australia-socceroos-live-updates-international-football-friendly-latest">Paul Izzo starred in the win over Canada</a> in Montreal.</p> <p>But the 52-year-old coach hinted that he would continue to tinker with the Socceroos’ lineup as he challenged emerging and fringe players to “surprise” him.</p> <p>Jacob Italiano was the latest player to be handed an international debut after impressing Popovic in training and started at right-back against Canada.</p> <p>“I’d love to be surprised by more players,” Popovic said. “They come [in] under this pressure, the expectation, they’re playing for their country, which is enough pressure on its own, and they deliver.</p> <p>“We saw a good, solid display by Jacob Italiano, which was fantastic for us as a coaching staff. Paul Izzo stepped up. We want a few more of those players to increase the depth and options come June next year.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/11/australia-usmnt-mls-patrick-yazbek-nashville-sc">A new frontier: why Aussies are coming to MLS for soccer opportunity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Popovic bristled at the suggestion from the US head coach, Mauricio Pochettino, that the Socceroos “keep the same shape and the way they are playing [over] the last year”.</p> <p>The Australia head coach argued that his side was “constantly making changes” and pointed to a young attack led by the teenage sensation Irankunda and forward Mohamed Toure.</p> <p>“We played a 19-year-old and 21-year-old up front,” Popovic said before the clash with the US at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park in Denver, Colorado. “We had a captain [Alessandro Circati] at 22.</p> <p>“I’m sure both teams want to build the continuity but at the same time trying to increase the depth of your squad, the depth of your team, the quality of your team.
