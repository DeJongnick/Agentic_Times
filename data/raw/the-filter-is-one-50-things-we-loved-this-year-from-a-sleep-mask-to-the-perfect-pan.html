<p>The Filter is turning one. Since we launched a year ago, we’ve run, hiked, camped and swum; we’ve drunk 455 cups of coffee; washed 34 loads of clothes; slept on mattresses for 2,240 hours, and much more, testing a total of 2,040 products – from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/21/best-coffee-machines">coffee machines</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/18/best-gins">gin</a> – to bring you the most rigorous, informed and entertaining buying advice.</p> <p>We’ve even had a decent stab at identifying the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/08/the-13-best-christmas-gifts-for-taylor-swift-fans">preferred lipstick of a global icon</a>. And we’ve<strong> </strong>helped you <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/07/how-to-buy-less">consume less</a> – and look after your precious things, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/mar/27/from-smash-proof-cases-to-updates-how-to-make-your-smartphone-last-longer">your phone</a> to your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/02/how-to-clean-care-wooden-kitchen-utensils">wooden kitchen utensils</a>, to make them last longer.</p> <p>To celebrate our birthday, we’ve asked our contributors – and our readers – to tell us the one thing they’ve tested or bought from our 409 articles (and counting) that they’ve loved the most. We’ve included a few of our personal favourites here on the Filter, too.</p> <p>From a slow cooker to a sleep mask, a highchair food catcher to a hot brush, here are 50 tried, tested and genuinely loved recommendations.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The Filter products we (and you) love the most</h2> <p>***</p> <h2>A perfectly portable blender</h2>    <p><strong>Ninja Blast cordless </strong><strong>blender</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://ninjakitchen.co.uk/product/ninja-blast-cordless-portable-blender-black-bc151ukbk-zidBC151UKBK" > £49.99 at Ninja </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://amazon.co.uk/Ninja-Portable-Rechargeable-Smoothies-BC151UKNV/dp/B0CJ39H6GG/" > £44 at Amazon </a>  <p>After reading the Filter’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/07/best-blenders">best blenders</a> article, I actually went out and bought the cordless Ninja Blast for making protein shakes. It’s fantastic, and I can stick it in my gym bag for a quick protein hit after a workout. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/leon-poultney">Leon Poultney</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Go retro with an MP3 player</h2>    <p><strong>Snowsky Echo Mini</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.advancedmp3players.co.uk/fiio-snowsky-echo-mini-portable-hi-res-music-player" > £49.99 at AMP3 </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/236196744286" > £66.99 at eBay </a>  <p>I’m a big fan of the Snowsky Echo Mini from my list of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/12/best-mp3-players-uk">best MP3 players</a>. It’s a great (re)introduction to portable music players, and the fact that it’s shaped like a cassette tape gives it a whole extra layer of charm. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alan-martin">Alan Martin</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Mix it up with cordless blending</h2>    <p><strong>KitchenAid cordless hand blender</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.kitchenaid.co.uk/hand-blenders/859711672530/cordless-hand-blender-plus-accessories-with-battery-kitchenaid-go-5khbrv75-matte-black" > £219 at KitchenAid </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/KitchenAid-GO-CORDLESS-ACCESSORIES-5KHBRV75BM/dp/B0D31FRSZH" > £219 at Amazon </a>  <p>I really liked the rechargeable battery concept of the KitchenAid Go cordless hand blender that I tested for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/07/best-blenders">best blenders</a> – not being tied to a plug socket makes all those little jobs so much easier. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachel-ogden">Rachel Ogden</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Beach campfire, in a candle</h2>    <p><strong>Smoky sea salt candle</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cornishseasalt.co.uk/products/smoked-sea-salt-candle" > £28 at Cornish Sea Salt </a>  <p>I hugely enjoyed testing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/dec/10/best-candles-gift">scented candles</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/09/best-diffuser-reed-oil-electric-uk">diffusers</a>. But the one I’m obsessed with is the Smoky Sea Salt candle by Cornish Sea Salt: it makes you feel like you’re sitting around a campfire on the beach. I can’t get enough of it. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-jacobs">Kate Jacobs</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Sleep aids for a blissful 40 winks</h2>    <p><strong>Otty Original Hyb</strong><strong>rid mattress</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://otty.com/products/the-otty-hybrid-mattress?variant=7683067510835" > From £499.99 at Otty </a>  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/mar/16/otty-original-hybrid-mattress-review">Otty Original Hybrid</a> mattress is my lone five-star review of the year, and the only one I subsequently bought for keeps.

I now have four, such is my fear of losing one to holiday baggage handlers or the eye mask fairy. <strong>J</strong><strong>H</strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Cosy socks</h2>    <p><strong>Heattech cable socks</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E480721-000/00" > £7.90 at Uniqlo </a>  <p>We featured a pair of Heattech socks last Christmas that quickly became the most popular item ever on the Filter (since overtaken by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/mar/16/otty-original-hybrid-mattress-review">Otty mattress</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/23/best-mascara-uk">a sub-£10 mascara</a>, among other things). I finally succumbed to curiosity and bought myself a pair towards the end of winter, and they were just perfect for the shoulder season, keeping me warm even with bare legs. I’ve since developed a full-blown obsession with Uniqlo technical fabrics (Heattech scarves, Airism shorts …), but I don’t think I can hold the socks fully responsible. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/monica-horridge">Monica Horridge</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Lovely booze-free bubbly</h2>    <p><strong>L’Arjolle Zero sparkling equilibre</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://wineathome.org/products/zero-sparkling-equilibre-domaine-de-larjolle-alcohol-free" > £13.45 at Wine at Home </a>  <p>I was surprised to discover there are some really good <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/27/best-non-alcoholic-low-alcohol-wines">non-alcoholic wines</a> out there that taste like the real deal. The L’Arjolle Zero sparkling equilibre was my favourite: with fine bubbles and depth of flavour, it’s a convincing alternative to real bubbly. I’m planning to get in a few bottles for Christmastime to moderate the intake a little and offer booze-free imbibers something tasty. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sophia-longhi">Sophia Longhi</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>A forever dress</h2>    <p><strong>Reiss Atelier maxidress</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.reiss.com/style/su571823/an6308" > £428 at Reiss </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.next.co.uk/style/su571823/an6308" > £428 at Next </a>  <p>This Reiss Atelier dress was one of the most expensive things I’ve <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jun/01/june-style-essentials">recommended</a>, and I hesitated to include it, but it is a truly beautiful piece that I will wear for ever.

Sturdy but lightweight, ridiculously comfy, not stupidly expensive – and they actually look nice too. <strong>JCM</strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Pitch-perfect camping</h2>    <p><strong>MSR Hubba Hubba NX tent</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/p/msr-hubba-hubba-nx-tent-D1312362.html" > £474.99 at Cotswold Outdoor </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.gooutdoors.co.uk/15898304/msr-hubba-hubba-nx-2-person-backpacking-tent-15898304" > £560 at Go Outdoors </a>  <p>I take my MSR Hubba Hubba tent wild camping all the time: it’s quick and intuitive to pitch and has two roomy porches, so it’s easy to share with another camper. And our <a href="https://boutiquecamping.com/products/luna-bell-tent">Boutique Glamping bell tent</a> comes to weddings, festivals and family camps with us; I love having headroom. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sian-lewis">Sian Lewis</a></strong></p> <p><em><strong>For more, read our guide to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jun/20/best-tents-uk">best tents</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>A knife made for gardens</h2>    <p><strong>Niwaki hori hori knife</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.niwaki.com/hori-hori/" > £32 at Niwaki </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.burford.co.uk/products/niwaki-hori-hori-weeding-trowel-with-holster/" > £32 at Burford </a>  <p>My green-fingered aunt bought me a hori hori knife from Niwaki (as recommended in our piece on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/dec/03/best-easy-christmas-gifts-repeat-ideas">gifts so good we buy them on repeat</a>) and I’m obsessed: it makes weeding really fast – and fun!<strong> SL</strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Joggers to pep up the WFH wardrobe</h2>    <p><strong>Adidas Originals Firebird track pants</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.adidas.co.uk/adicolor-classic-firebird-loose-track-tracksuit-bottoms/KD2528.html" > £60 at Adidas </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.asos.com/adidas-originals/adidas-originals-firebird-track-pants-in-green/prd/208128329#colourWayId-208128330" > £60 at Asos </a>  <p>I bought the Adidas Firebird joggers in green after Peter Bevan highlighted them in his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/30/men-summer-wardrobe-updates-uk">50 men’s summer wardrobe updates</a>. I wanted to update my work-from-home attire, so I don’t feel like such a slob when I pop out on my lunch break. These fit the bill perfectly: they’re comfy to sit in all day, but they also look good – plus they add a nice pop of colour to my wardrobe. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lily-smith">Lily Smith</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Steamed rice microwave-style</h2>    <p><strong>Sistema rice steamer</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/sistema-round-2.6litre-rice-steamer-21921879.html" > £7.99 at Currys </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sistema-Microwave-Rice-Cooker-2-6/dp/B00BTIVNT4" > £7.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>I’ve always wanted a rice cooker, but I don’t have the counter space. So when I saw Joanne Gould recommend this affordable microwave version in her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/mar/14/best-rice-cooker">review of the best rice cookers</a>, I gave it a go. It produced much more delicious and less starchy rice than I’d ever managed in a saucepan, and all for £7.99.<strong> LS</strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>The perfect hot brush</h2>    <p><strong>GHD Duet </strong><strong>Blowdry hairdryer brush</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.ghdhair.com/wet-to-dry/ghd-duet-blowdry-hair-dryer-brush-in-black-p-663" > £379 at GHD </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/p/ghd-duet-blowdry-white/15326341/" > £379 at Lookfantastic </a>  <p>I thought nothing would make me part with my well-tried and very trusted <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Revlon-One-Step-volumiser-technology-RVDR5222/dp/B08C8HKBN1">Revlon One Step hot brush</a>, but the GHD Duet Blowdry I tested for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/13/best-hot-brushes-uk">best hot brushes</a> really did blow me away.
