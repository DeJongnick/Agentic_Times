<p>Publishing this list is like giving you an X-ray examination into my funny bone, the area that harbours all of my dumbest, stoopidest and most insincere thoughts. I got a case of dumb-dumb-itis; it’s bad doc, real bad!</p> <p>Please do not take this examination lightly. I had to do a lot of archive searching and cross-referencing; I sought counsel from gurus and masters in the field. I dove deep. My room looked like a murder mystery of red string and pins, low light and a cream Burberry trench with some Loewe spectacles adorning the peak of my nose just so I could be ready.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>My goal was to make you laugh – but after many meditations, sound bowls and endless Kristen Wiig SNL videos, I realised that the beauty of humour is that it is so personal, so my approach was thus: to find content that altered my mind’s chemistry and geared it toward joy. Simple.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/14/sashi-perera-the-10-funniest-things-i-have-ever-seen-on-the-internet">Sashi Perera: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These videos may not all be funny to you, but they provided years of entertainment and camaraderie between peers that are still quoted almost 20 years later. All this to say, humour does not come without a slight sweat on my furrowed brow, sore cheek, and a little gas. I took this seriously.</p> <h2>1. Cole Escola: Serial Killer Documentary Takes Horrible Turn</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fne4v_zBQs"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5fne4v_zBQs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This piece of cinema speaks for itself: nuance, dedication to role and craft. A true artist and provocateur of our generation but … something about that … just doesn’t sit right with me. Cole’s performance is arresting and I find myself quoting this in the kitchen in the dead of night sometimes with no one around. Cole is a true harbinger, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. We MUST stay vigilant.</p> <h2>2. Golden Girls Full Remix Soul Version</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWD_VPiMlso"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mWD_VPiMlso?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This rendition of the Golden Girls theme song sent me into the STraTosphere when I first saw it 10 years ago. I have not stopped singing it since. The way the hair is TORN off the scalp at the end, I was absolutely transcending. I push to motion that this become our new national anthem.</p> <h2>3. Saturday Night Live: Liza Minnelli Tries to Turn Off a Lamp</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVvxOwxuk_w"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nVvxOwxuk_w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>OK so I have to be so real with you doc, I need another cure. I have an obsession with this woman right here; I have studied Kristen Wiig with a microscopic eye. This woman right here may be one of our greatest minds. She should be the first contact between aliens when they arrive. She is a true titan of her craft. I gift you this video and implore you to deep dive into all her works and, if I could, I’d link the entire 107 minutes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/feb/11/barb-and-star-go-to-vista-del-mar-review-goofy-bridesmaids-reunion">Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</a> right here and be done with this whole article.</p> <h2>4. Mad TV 2007 – Bird Poop</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RI0UGy7kTI"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7RI0UGy7kTI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Now, these next two videos are where it all started. I am because they are YGM?? Like no I need you to deep it for real. These are THE KEY to understanding me. From the absolute devolution and whimsical anarchy of the birds pooping video, the disruption and absurdity, the characters breaking to the genius timing of the Can I Have Yo Numba skit. UGH it’s like watching a Beethoven symphony or the city of Babylon being built. It is such a big pivotal moment for me. Twelve-year-old me was in absolute stitches for months at the idea that humour could be so utterly void of anything cerebral at all. Not a single thought, just pure entertainment.</p> <h2>5. Mad TV – Can I Have Your Number?</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFZyl7hfBw"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kTFZyl7hfBw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This skit broke open the tesseract of character acting for me and I became the class clown instantly. Nicole Randall Johnson, wherever you are, I hope to God you know what you’ve done. The second horseman of the apocalypse. You changed the course of my life, immeasurably.</p> <h2>6. Judge Rinder: defendant whispers ‘licky licky’, confuses everyone</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azd7GwqPHM4"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/azd7GwqPHM4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Following this line of stupidity is the ever eloquent and incredibly persuasive court case of “licky licky”. To be in the eye of the law and to have your fate tried before you and for you to come out with something so genius as “licky licky” as your primary defence is unfathomable. I was rendered a puddle on the floor, puddle in my pants, puddle under my eyes. I was liquid.</p> <h2>7. Don’t Call Me Shirley – Airplane!</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixljWVyPby0"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ixljWVyPby0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I surely gotta thank my dad for introducing me to the absolute wonder that is Airplane; I’m serious, thanks Dad! And I won’t call you Shirley! RIP Leslie Nielsen, you would’ve loved Keke Palmer. This film is an onslaught of physical humour from the outset. You cannot catch a break; if you need a good laugh, you can’t go wrong here.</p> <h2>8. Ts Madison x Nicki Minaj</h2>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Video of TS Maddison unwrapping a takeaway meal.">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@tsmadisonnewsone/video/7323036049981148462&quot; data-video-id=&quot;7323036049981148462&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@tsmadisonnewsone&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@tsmadisonnewsone?refer=embed&quot;&gt;@tsmadisonnewsone&lt;/a&gt; Throwback Thursday @therealtsmadison &lt;a title=&quot;tsmadison&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tsmadison?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#tsmadison&lt;/a&gt; @nickiminaj &lt;a title=&quot;nickiminaj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nickiminaj?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#nickiminaj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;romansrevenge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/romansrevenge?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#romansrevenge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;♬ original sound  - Ts Madison News One&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-Ts-Madison-News-One-7323036056767482667?refer=embed&quot;&gt;♬ original sound  - Ts Madison News One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Oh thank GOD we’ve reached the part where I get to talk about our sister Ts Madison. Allow me to invoke her name! Ts Madison, Ts Madison, Ts Madison. This woman is Unserious to the bone. She is praying over a bowl of chipotle and reciting the sacred text and so shall I. I would watch her watch paint dry.</p> <h2>9. 73 Questions With Nicole Kidman</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI2ucw7hP34"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kI2ucw7hP34?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>To wind us down before the end dear reader-doctor, I’d like to pull your attention to Nicole Kidman’s 73 Questions, the first redhead to ever exist and the only person in history to not have that thought in the back of their mind that says “maybe this is cringe”. This woman is brimming with mirth and frivolity, she’s just a crazy gal in an increasingly unimaginative world. But don’t get it twisted, she is not afraid of truth and honesty. She’ll let you in – all you have to do is ask, “Nicole, how are you feeling these days?”</p> <h2>10. Cole Escola – Mom Commercial</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8KjZ7wKYUc"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w8KjZ7wKYUc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>And finally, doc, to conclude the list of symptoms before you come up with your prognosis (a terminal case of stupidity I can venture to guess), I’d like to book-end with another Cole Escola film. I’ll let it speak for itself.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Zarif is an actor/writer/model from Egypt, Sudan and Australia who has appeared in Choir Boys and Netflix’s Wellmania and Lonesome.
