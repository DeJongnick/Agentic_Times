<p>Resistance is growing to Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, with the mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, signing an executive order to counter the president’s move.</p> <p>The order prevents the Chicago police department from collaborating with federal authorities on patrols, immigration enforcement, or conducting traffic stops and checkpoints. It also restricts officers from wearing face coverings to hide their identities.</p> <p>Johnson has accused the president of “behaving outside the bounds of the constitution” and of being “reckless and out of control”, while the White House insists the potential flood of federal agents is about “cracking down on crime”.</p> <p>“If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the president, their communities would be much safer,” said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.</p> <p>Here are the key stories.</p>  <h2>Chicago mayor signs executive order directing city to resist Trump’s immigration raids</h2>  <p>The mayor of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago">Chicago</a> has signed an executive order outlining how the city will attempt to resist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s immigration crackdown.</p> <p>Brandon Johnson pushed back on Saturday against what he called the “out-of-control” Trump administration’s plan to deploy large numbers of federal officers into the country’s third-largest city, which could take place within days.</p> <p>The Chicago police department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge, according to the executive order Johnson signed.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/chicago-mayor-executive-order-trump-immigration-raids"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>More than 500 workers at Voice of America and other broadcasters to be laid off</h2>  <p>The agency that oversees Voice of America and other government-funded international broadcasters is eliminating jobs for more than 500 employees, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> official said.
