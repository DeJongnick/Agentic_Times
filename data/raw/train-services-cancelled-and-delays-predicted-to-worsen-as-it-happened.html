  <p><strong>Australia accused of ‘provoking’ China in South China Sea</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>China</strong> accused <strong>Australia</strong> of deliberately “provoking” China in the South China Sea this week, and of “invading” and “breaking into” the homes of others, its defence ministry said on Friday, <strong>Reuters</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>The ministry spokesperson said Australia was spreading “false narratives”.</p> 
  <p>Australia on Thursday raised concerns with China over what it said were “unsafe and unprofessional” actions by a Chinese fighter jet towards an Australian maritime patrol in the South China Sea earlier in the week, an account disputed by Beijing.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW Greens call on mental health minister to rule out private hospitals holding patients involuntarily</strong></p> 
  <p>Involuntary mental health patients being treated in a private hospital is a “fundamental human rights concern”, the NSW Greens say as they call the state government to rule out the possibility.</p> 
  <p>Guardian Australia in January <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/17/nsw-government-asks-private-sector-to-take-public-hospital-patients-as-hundreds-of-psychiatrists-set-to-resign">revealed the NSW government was considering moving public patients to private settings</a> in preparation for the mass resignations of the state’s psychiatrists - despite concerns private hospitals were not appropriate settings for high-risk patients and they were not legally able to take involuntary patients (those detained under the Mental Health Act).</p> 
  <p>On January 30, NSW health secretary <strong>Susan Pearce</strong> announced the government had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jan/30/australia-news-live-caravan-attack-explosives-dural-antisemitism-leeser-chris-minns-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-ntwnfb?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-679b1b988f083fa6b3a7bef3#block-679b1b988f083fa6b3a7bef3">begun moving public psychiatric patients into private hospitals</a>, and said it is was also considering declaring these for-profit facilities as legally able to admit involuntary patients.</p> 
  <p>NSW Greens’ health spokesperson, Dr <strong>Amanda Cohn, </strong>has <a href="https://www.amandacohn.org/no_involuntary_mental_health_care_in_private_hospitals">started a petition</a> calling on the NSW mental health minister, <strong>Rose Jackson,</strong> to rule out this option.</p> 
  <p>The petition states “the possibility of profit motives influencing the assessment of people experiencing mental illness and whether or not they are detained against their will is a fundamental risk to human rights.”</p> 
  <p>Cohn, a former GP said the prospect has “rightly alarmed people with lived experience of mental illness and their loved ones”.</p> 
  <p>“For-profit involuntary care is counter to the principles of the Mental Health Act, under which care must be delivered through the least restrictive means necessary.</p> 
  <p>“So far, the NSW government has responded to the mass resignation of psychiatrists by plugging gaps with expensive, inefficient temporary staff, and now it wants to put the most vulnerable patients in private hospitals not equipped to support them.”</p>

  <p><strong>Government consulting with tech industry on YouTube exclusion from under-16s media ban</strong></p> 
  <p>The federal government is conducting confidential consultations with the tech industry over the decision to explicitly exclude YouTube from the under 16s social media ban.</p> 
  <p>Guardian Australia has seen briefing documents sent to industry this week seeking feedback on the proposed platforms the ban would apply to.</p> 
  <p>The communications minister, <strong>Michelle Rowland</strong>, said last year that YouTube would be included in a range of services exempt from the ban on health and education grounds, but in the draft wording of the document that sets out what services are exempt, YouTube is granted an exemption on its own, while health and education services are another carve-out.</p> 
  <p>In the document, the communications department states that “based on research” from the eSafety commissioner:</p> 
  <p>YouTube has consistently ranked as one of the top digital services used by children and young people in Australia. While the platform undoubtedly functions as a source of entertainment and leisure, it is an important source of education and informational content, relied on by children, parents and carers, and educational institutions. This contrasts substantially with other content streaming services, which are predominantly used by young people to view short-form entertainment content.</p> 
  <p>The exclusion of YouTube from the ban has raised some eyebrows in the sector, given it has many of the same algorithmic, rabbit-hole features that other platforms have been accused of that led to the under 16s ban.</p> 
  <p>Guardian Australia has sought comment from the minister’s office.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Sydney parents urged to organise alternative transport from school amid rail delays</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Sydney transport authorities have warned parents of schoolchildren who rely on trains to get home to organise alternative pickups, as industrial action cripples the city’s rail network.</p> 
  <p>More than 90% of morning peak services were either cancelled or delayed. By 1:30pm on Friday, more than 800 services had been cancelled across all lines, with the T2 Leppington and Inner West and T8 Airport and South lines hardest hit. There were cascading delays across the network, with 396 not running to time.</p> 
  <p>By 2pm, when a key roster period began, 576 train drivers and guards<strong> </strong>hadn’t turned up to work – including a “big uptick” in sick leave at rates not seen since the height of Covid.</p> 
  <p>Disruptions were likely to worsen throughout the afternoon and evening, Sydney Trains CEO Matt Longland said, while urging staff rostered on from 2pm to turn up for work.</p> 
  <p>Longland said buses were shuttling travellers from Central Station to the airport but he suggested, as an alternative, catching the Metro to Sydenham and then taking a taxi or Uber. The Metro is operated separately and was unaffected by industrial action.</p> 
  <p>A cap on Uber surge pricing will continue to be in place on Friday afternoon, while parents of school children who return home by train have been told to organise alternative pickups.</p>

  <p><strong>Decision to withdraw Khaled Sabsabi from Venice Biennale ‘deeply troubling’</strong></p> 
  <p>Australia’s peak advocacy body for contemporary Australian artists has condemned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/feb/13/khaled-sabsabi-dropped-as-australias-representative-to-venice-biennale-ntwnfb">Creative Australia’s decision to withdraw Lebanese-born Australian artist Khaled Sabsabi from the 2026 Venice Biennale</a>.</p> 
  <p>The executive director of the National Association for the Visual Arts (Nava), Penelope Benton, told the Guardian the decision by Creative Australia’s board made on Thursday evening was “deeply troubling”.</p> 
  <p>“This is a devastating and terrifying moment for artistic freedom in Australia,” Benton said.</p> 
  <p>“The decision to retract support from an artist of Sabsabi’s calibre in response to political and media pressure is an attack on arms-length arts funding and the independence of the arts sector.”</p> 
  <p>Benton said the decision to withdraw Sabsabi’s selection as Australia’s representative at the biennale threw doubt on the Australian government’s ability to uphold the right of artists to critically engage with history and politics.</p> 
  <p>“The government’s intervention in this selection process is an outrageous overreach that threatens the very foundation of independent arts funding,” she said.</p> 
  <p>At the core of the controversy is Sabsabi’s 2007 video installation titled You, which includes images of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p> 
  <p>The artist gifted the work to Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) in 2009.</p> 
  <p>Benton said the work exemplified Sabsabi’s ability to contextualise contested histories and challenge dominant narratives.</p> 
  <p>“Recent misrepresentation of this work — specifically, the distortion of his use of an image of Hassan Nasrallah — demonstrates a profound lack of engagement with artistic practice and context,” she said.</p> 
  <p>The former longstanding director of the MCA, Elizabeth Ann Macgregor, took to social media on Friday to condemn the Creative Australia decision, saying on Instagram she was “shocked and disgusted”.</p> 
  <p>“Instead of defending an artist from the bullying and misrepresentation of his work by the Australian newspaper amplified by politicians who haven’t even seen it, Creative Australia caves in,” she posted.</p> 
  <p>“I hope the Venice Biennale supporters withdraw their support .”</p>

  <p><strong>RSL Victoria defends call for taxpayers to fund for Anzac Day ceremony, despite millions in pokies revenue</strong></p> 
  <p>RSL Victoria’s president, <strong>Rob Webster</strong>, has defended calls for the state government to cover the cost of Melbourne’s biggest Anzac Day service, despite some sub-branches generating more than $2bn from poker machines in a decade. </p> 
  <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/14/scrapping-of-anzac-day-funding-raised-at-crisis-meeting-of-victorian-rsl-clubs-ntwnfb">Guardian Australia revealed an internal push for the RSL to stop paying for the services, </a>so money could instead be spent on supporting veterans in need. The call came from sub-branch representatives who feared they could close due to financial challenges. </p> 
  <p>In an interview with ABC Melbourne, Webster said state and local governments provided about $160,000 for Anzac Day services in the City of Melbourne. He said the RSL paid about half a million dollars last year. </p> 
  <p>A recent study published in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anzjph.2024.100214">Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health</a> found RSL Victoria sub-branches with poker machines collected $2.097bn in revenue from gambling between 2009 and 2019. </p> 
  <p>During the interview, Epstein asked why the RSL didn’t demand a bigger share of that money to finance the Anzac Day ceremonies. Webster said sub-branches did provide the state executive with money, but suggested it wasn’t enough:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>They give us $6m a year to run various activities a year, including Anzac Day. But it is still always a struggle to get the money. </em></p> 
   <p><em>I accept that there is some suggestion that we don’t get enough money from sub-branches, but sub-branches run about 30% of their turnover back to their community... much of it to veterans. It goes into the local footy club, it goes into local schools for scholarships. We also need to maintain upkeep of buildings where veterans meet. </em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Webster said RSL sub-branches with poker machines used some of that revenue to run Anzac Day ceremonies in their own communities. </p>

  <p><strong>Cost-of-living crunch fuelling DV support service need</strong></p> 
  <p>Women escaping domestic and family violence are facing greater barriers due to the cost-of-living crisis, <strong>AAP</strong> reports, with advocates calling for dedicated funding for support services in the federal budget.</p> 
  <p><strong>An estimated 1,000 women each week are being turned away from support services due to a lack of capacity.</strong></p> 
  <p>In its submission to the 2025-26 federal budget, <strong>Women’s Legal Services Australia</strong> (WLSA) has called for urgent funding of $52m over five years to help meet demand and ensure victim-survivors of violence can access the specialist legal help they need. Chair <strong>Elena Rosenman</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is a national crisis, and the demand for our services is only growing. Financial stress is a well documented factor in domestic violence, and rising living costs are making it even harder for victim-survivors to leave abusive relationships.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>More than 26,000 women accessed legal assistance and non-legal support from WLSA in 2023-24.</p> 
  <p>Along with the rising cost of living, a number of additional factors are contributing to the increased need for legal services, the peak body said in its submission. This includes the <strong>increasing frequency and severity of climate disasters, which exacerbates financial stress within families and escalates domestic violence.</strong></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Continuing from our last post, via <strong>AAP</strong>: GFG Alliance has also been under intense pressure from the South Australian government to pay tens of millions of dollars owed to creditors of the Whyalla steelworks and the government, including $15m to SA Water.</p> 
  <p>GFG chairman <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong> said today’s agreement with the Greensill creditors is “a great relief for GFG and … gives us a financial platform for recovery and growth.”</p> 
  <p>The $150m in financing Gupta was seeking had been expected to be finalised before the end of 2024.</p> 
  <p>SA Premier <strong>Peter Malinauskas</strong>, who visited Whyalla on Tuesday to “gather intelligence” from GFG’s creditors, said he welcomed the news. He told FIVEAA in Adelaide:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is on the face of it good news, but <strong>I approach it with great caution. </strong>And the reason why I say that is because I’ve seen a number of statements by GFG over the months and years – some as promising as this one – and they haven’t fully materialised.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Billionaire Sanjeev Gupta to sell coalmine to prop up Whyalla steelworks</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A UK billionaire will try to sell a coalmine to prop up the Whyalla steelworks, <strong>AAP</strong> reports, as he announced a deal to settle billions of dollars of debt linked to a financier’s collapse.</p> 
  <p><strong>GFG Alliance</strong> chairman <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong> says a debt settlement deal had been reached with creditors of global financier <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>, which had advanced billions of dollars in credit to GFG before it collapsed in 2021.</p> 
  <p>But the deal, which GFG said would be the “final chapter” in clearing worldwide debts of up to $US4bn ($A6.3bn), is subject to final legal agreement and will return to court in the UK in six weeks.</p> 
  <p>GFG had launched an “expedited process” to sell its equity in the <strong>Tahmoor Coking Coal</strong> mine in NSW and some of the proceeds from the sale would be available for reinvestment in Whyalla, allowing the firm “to catch up with supplier payments and boost liquidity, subject to board approval”, the company said.</p> 
  <p>The Tahmoor sale could reportedly be worth up to $800m. Production at the mine halted in January and workers were sent home on full pay, after suppliers stopped deliveries over unpaid bills.</p>

  <p>Addressing attendees, among them chief minister <strong>Andrew Barr </strong>and former parliamentary colleague <strong>Katy Gallagher</strong>, Shorten acknowledged recent times had “not been easy” for UC, nor throughout higher education, which he described as the “great liberator of personal freedom”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We have to accept the challenges of the current environment. The entire university sector, not just UC, is in a state of change – mirroring the state of our world.

   <p>I’ve always been very involved with trade unions and my brothers know he was a scab.</p>

  <p>And for Haines, Betoota asked if “Wodonga [is] the Springfield of the Upper Murray, and Albury the Shelbyville? Or is it the other way around?”</p>

  <p>At the National Press Club, a reporter asked whether renewable energy provides an economic opportunity for the regions – and <strong>Helen Haines</strong> said it does, “if we do it right”.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They’re seeing massive landscape change, a change to their visual amenity – which really means something to us in the bush – genuine concerns about what grid-scale solar means in terms of bushfire safety. What does grid-scale energy look like in terms of biosecurity risks, insurance, land values for adjoining properties? These are real and genuine concerns from real and genuine rural and regional Australians.</p>

  <p>She said the government needs to get the community benefit angle of the transition right and “get rid of the cowboys who stir up fear in communities”.</p>

  <p>Haines said she doesn’t believe it is “confusion” when people call her a teal, but it is more deliberate:</p>

   <p><strong>I think it’s very deliberate because there’s been, from the major parties, a weaponisation of that term.</strong> And any women in the audience today who find themselves being successful in their career and exercising the power that comes with office will be familiar with the many ways that the system attempts to undermine their authority.

  <p>A 39-year-old man who had been operating machinery on the property was flown to Royal North Shore hospital with burns, but died the next day. The incident had been raised at Senate hearings investigating the effect of the 3G mobile network closure.</p>

  <p><strong>Shanyn Sparreboom</strong>, a senior public servant from the federal communications department on Wednesday told the inquiry Telstra advised the government of the incident and prepared a report. It found eight calls were made to triple zero on that day, three of which did not connect due to poor signal strength, Sparreboom said.</p> 
  <p>A Telstra statement said its investigation found the failed calls – including some from other mobile providers – either cut out or did not connect.</p>

   <p>These calls were made in areas with traditionally poor to no coverage and not related to the closure of 3G.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The way in which bargaining takes place is that unions begin by lodging a log of claims, and <strong>clearly they did not include this in their log of claims</strong> …</p> 
   <p>They are disputing as to whether they needed to ultimately – ordinarily, common sense would suggest that if you are asking for $60m in pay, you’d claim it. <strong>The fact that it wasn’t in their log of claims is the reason why the machinery of government wasn’t triggered, until they claimed it last night</strong> …</p> 
   <p>Most people would understand that that clause automatically expires, unless you demand for it to stay. And it’s disappointing that the dispute is having to bog down in this level of minutia, when, frankly, the offer on the table is pretty good.</p>

   <p>We know that the US has a trade surplus with Australia. We have zero tariffs of any US goods into Australia, and Australian steel is making a positive difference to the US economy by putting roofs on houses, by making a difference there in the US as well.</p> 
   <p>BlueScope aren’t just investing here in Australia. They’re also investing in the United States, $5 billion of investment at plants across the states, across many facilities as well. It is in both Australia and the United States’s interest to have economic cooperation, and that’s what I am endeavouring to achieve. And we had a great discussion this week with President Trump.</p>

  <p>He was in the seat of Whitlam, held by retiring assistant minister <strong>Stephen Jones</strong>, with the new candidate, <strong>Carol Berry</strong>. Albanese called Whitlam “the heart and soul of the Labor party”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted">

  <p><strong>ACCC says independent slot manager ‘critical’ for Sydney airport</strong></p> 
  <p>The <strong>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</strong> says the creation of an independent slot manager at Sydney airport is “critical” for improving competition despite conceding last year its impact would be small.</p> 
  <p>The commission, which is fronting senators at a parliamentary inquiry this morning, was asked about whether <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/08/controversial-sydney-airport-slot-system-faces-government-crackdown">the Albanese government’s changes last year</a> would improve the level of competition at the busy airport, and lower flight prices.</p> 
  <p>The changes related to the airport’s controversial slot allocation system, which restricts the airport to 80 takeoffs and landings per hour – known as slots. An overnight curfew to minimise noise further limits flight numbers.</p> 
  <p>The laws introduce an independent slot manager, introduce civil penalties, an extreme weather “recovery period” and stronger enforcement powers in an effort to crack down on the Qantas-Virgin duopoly.</p> 
  <p>The independent MP <strong>Allegra Spender</strong> asked the commission whether it believed the longstanding arrangements, which benefit incumbent airlines, could be improved as a result of the changes. The commission’s chair, <strong>Gina Cass-Gottlieb</strong>, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The reforms that have been announced [and have passed], we think, are very important. We do consider, on what we have seen of the process that has been proposed, that it meets the standards across government you would expect to see in terms of integrity and independence. The critical point is to move from the situation where currently there’s a representative of each of the airlines making these decisions, which manifestly does not have the required independence, and in fact poses conflicts.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Slot hoarding is where airlines schedule more flights than they intend to run, before cancelling them in a strategic manner so as not to cancel any service more than 20% of the time, so they retain the slot at the expense of a competitor (known as the 80:20 rule). Weather cancellations don’t count towards an airline’s limit.</p> 
  <p>Qantas Group and Virgin have consistently denied they misuse slots.</p>

  <p>As <strong>AAP</strong> reports, a study released today found high-integrity carbon farming projects could result in large-scale landscape restoration and increased biodiversity habitats.</p> 
  <p>Government policies to date have favoured projects that support lower-cost emissions abatement, rather than high-biodiversity value projects that can involve relatively higher financial costs.</p> 
  <p>Co-authored by a peak body for the nation’s 54 natural resource management bodies and the member-led Carbon Market Institute (CMI), the report calls for a “step-change” to encourage the scale of investment required to support nature.</p> 
  <p>There was untapped potential in the carbon market for solving the “twin crises” of climate and biodiversity, CMI chief executive <strong>John Connor</strong> said.</p> 
  <p>The report found carbon projects can, and do, contribute to nature outcomes, but Australia lacked clear regulatory or commercial drivers for carbon credit buyers to invest in nature.</p>

  <p><strong>Environment organisations request mission to examine if salmon farming affecting Tasmanian world heritage area</strong></p> 
  <p>Fourteen environment organisations have written to the World Heritage Centre asking it to send a mission to Macquarie Harbour, on Tasmania’s west coast, to examine whether salmon farming is affecting the state’s world heritage area.</p> 
  <p>The letter highlights the plight of the Maugean skate, an endangered ray-like fish species that has lived in the region since the time of the dinosaurs and which is at the centre of a heated political fight over the future of fish farms in the harbour.</p> 
  <p>The federal environment minister, <strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong>, is reconsidering the future of salmon farm licences in the harbour after a legal request by environment groups.</p> 
  <p>Scientists have advised the Australian government that fish farms are the greatest threat to the species’ survival and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/15/tasmania-salmon-industry-macquarie-harbour-maugean-skate">recommended it be dramatically scaled back or removed</a>. The salmon industry and the Tasmanian Liberal government and Labor opposition have responded forcefully, pledging to fight any decision that affects jobs.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Peace talks between Ukraine and Russia must be on Ukraine’s terms, <strong>Richard Marles</strong> says, after US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire">announced he began negotiations</a> with Russian president <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> earlier this week.</p> 
  <p>The defence minister told ABC radio this morning he welcomed efforts to resolve the conflict, which began in early 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine, but said the conflict must be resolved on Ukraine’s terms.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>It really matters this conflict is resolved on Ukraine’s terms and the reason for that is it was Russia who was the aggressor.</strong> It was Russia who broke international law, it was Russia who invaded a smaller neighbour, not by reference to international law, but really by reference to power and might. And that example cannot be allowed to stand.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Trump said he would be “OK” with Ukraine not gaining Nato membership and added it would be “unlikely” Ukraine would regain much of the territory Russia has taken control of.</p> 
  <p>The Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> said he had spoken to Trump and supported peace talks but would not be able to accept any agreements without Ukraine’s involvement in negotiations.</p>

  <p>Men’s behavioural change programs need to be better funded to provide tailored, holistic and timely services that can support meaningful behaviour change, an evidence brief from Australia’s National Research organisation for Women’s Safety (Anrows) and No To Violence has shown.</p> 
  <p>Men’s behaviour change programs are group-based interventions for men who have used domestic, family, and sexual violence against a current or former partner or other family members.</p> 
  <p>While these programs are a key intervention for people who use violence, the report highlights that they are not a stand-alone solution. The Anrows chief executive, <strong>Dr Tessa Boyd-Caine</strong>, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>People who use violence must be held accountable. But men’s behaviour change programs can’t do this on their own. The evidence is clear that accountability must extend beyond individual programs to a coordinated system that spans the justice, social service, housing and community sectors.</p> 
   <p>A whole-of-system approach is needed for lasting change in men’s behaviour that brings safety for victims and survivors.</p>

  <p>The male nurse has since apologised through his lawyer.</p> 
  <p>As <strong>Sarah Basford Canales</strong> reports, Dutton said a “proper process” should be in place to “understand how this individual became an Australian citizen and where the failing in the system originated and how we can make sure it doesn’t happen again”.</p> 
  <p>Guardian Australia understands one of the nurses gained citizenship in 2020, years after fleeing from Afghanistan to Australia as a child, while Dutton was home affairs minister.</p>

   <p>Some people might not be able to lose a day’s pay, so they’ll come to work. Other people might say, “I don’t like how I’ve been treated for the past nine months”, and decide not to come to work. It really is a moving feast.</p>

  <p>We’ll aim to bring you the latest here on the blog as soon as we can.</p> 
  <p>In a statement this morning, Warnes said commuters were experiencing delays this morning “as a result of Transport for NSW’s decision to lock out its rail workers from Friday morning”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Over 5,000 lock-out notices have been issued to employees on an individual basis. This is what happens when this sort of extreme industrial strategy is rolled out on vital public transport infrastructure.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said claims from the state government that rail workers threw an extra payment into the mix are “completely untrue.”</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The payment in question is an existing entitlement contained within the enterprise agreement – it is nothing new at all. In fact, the payment in question was offered up by the union in exchange for a pay rise in the final year of the agreement.</p> 
   <p>The government’s tactics of attempting to whip up public fury and using legal strategies to silence and intimidate workers needs to be put behind us.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Australia’s biggest R&amp;B music festival, <strong>Souled Out</strong>, cancelled its 2025 event yesterday afternoon, in the latest hit to the nation’s festival industry.</p> 
  <p>In a post to social media, Souled Out said it had not reached the level of support it needed to remain financially viable:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Like many festivals in Australia, we have faced ongoing challenges in the current market. After exploring every possible option, we’ve had to make the tough call to cancel this year’s edition of Souled Out.</p>

  <p>The festival was scheduled to take place in Melbourne on 22 February, Sydney on 23 February and Brisbane on 28 February, with international acts such as <strong>Don Toliver, Jhene Aiko </strong>and<strong> Vince Staples.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Steggall and McKenzie have back-and-forth over electoral reforms</strong></p> 
  <p>Earlier in the week, the major parties struck a deal to cap political donations and campaign spending, sidelining crossbenchers in a major overhaul of federal electoral laws.</p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">

  </aside> 
  <p>Nationals senator <strong>Bridget McKenzie</strong> spoke on Sky News about this earlier, and was asked how much this move had to do with curbing the teals. She argued that the “union movement [and] the industrial renewable complex” was funding teals, and that this threatened transparency.</p> 
  <p>Teal MP <strong>Zali Steggall</strong> was also on the program, and said the “only concessions that occurred in relation to the negotiations between Labor and the Coalition was, in fact, to reduce transparency”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>At the end of the day, if this was so above board, why does it have to be ran through parliament? Why could it not take the course of all pieces of legislation and be sent to inquiry so that we actually can interrogate the legislation and ensure the public gets bang for buck?</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>McKenzie and Steggall had a back-and-forth over whether or not the bill was adequately scrutinised. As <strong>Dan Jervis-Bardy</strong> reports, independent thinktank Centre for Public Integrity said it was an “affront to our democratic process” that such complex legislation could be rammed through without a parliamentary inquiry.</p> 
  <p>But the government had argued that donation and spending caps were widely canvassed by parliament’s joint standing committee on electoral matters, whose recommendations shaped <strong>Don Farrell</strong>’s bill. As debate wrapped up, Steggall said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is there is no one that is duped by this as being an attempt of the major parties to delve into public funds to keep themselves on a drip support, because they know their popularity with people is falling dramatically with every election.</p>

  <p><strong>Holocaust survivor and author Dr Gabor Maté addresses Wheeler Centre in Melbourne</strong></p> 
  <p>Hundreds of members of Melbourne’s Jewish community gathered at the Wheeler Centre last night for a frank and bracing discussion about trauma, liberation, justice and Israel’s war on Gaza with renowned Jewish trauma specialist, Holocaust survivor and author <strong>Dr Gabor Maté.</strong></p> 
  <p>In conversation with human rights lawyer and former South African anti-apartheid activist Emeritus Prof <strong>Andrea Durbach</strong>, Maté described his experience as a child who survived the Nazi encroachment on Budapest, his youth in the Zionist movement and his repudiation of it after the Vietnam war.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>I began to question why is the same press that is so enthusiastically and relentlessly lying about Vietnam so supportive of us Jews? The same dishonest, malevolent western press? And then I began to do some research … Right from the beginning of Zionism, there’d been Jews, even Zionists, who opposed the Zionist project, because they knew where it was going.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Israel’s war on Gaza and the conflation of Zionism and Israel’s actions with Jewish identity by Jewish organisations around the world was contributing to the rise in antisemitism, and the logic of Israel’s actions was reinforced by the colonial countries in which many Jewish people live, Maté said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Racism in general is rising in the world, and so is antisemitism, but I don’t see it as distinct from other forms of racism. Number one, we have to ask, why is racism rising, and what are the forces driving that? …</em> <em>When Israel declares itself to be – which it has – the state of the Jews … and it acts in the name of the Jews, for the benefit of the Jews – that’s what we’re telling the world – then what are people supposed to think of the Jews when the Jews massacre Palestinian children?</em></p> 
   <p><em>So who’s creating it? Who’s creating this identification of mass murder with Jewishness? … The same Jewish organisations that complain about antisemitism are feeding it with identification of these unspeakable acts and this oppression and this terrible occupation with the Jews – “the Jews” in quotation marks.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Call to bring back inheritance tax to tackle wealth gap</strong></p> 
  <p>Inheritance taxes were abolished in Australia in the late ‘90s – but <a href="https://www.anglicare.asn.au/research-advocacy/research-reports/">Anglicare Australia argues in a report</a> today that the government should seriously look into reinstating it, <strong>AAP</strong> reports. Its executive director, <strong>Kasy Chambers</strong>, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Australia is becoming more unfair and more unequal. Our research shows that we are one of the only countries in the OECD that doesn’t tax big inheritances. This has turbocharged inequality, concentrating wealth among a smaller and smaller group of people.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Anglicare is calling for a tax on high-value inheritances above $2m, not including the family home, which would avoid placing additional burden on low- and middle-class households.</p> 
  <p>In recent years, Australia’s taxation burden has increasingly fallen on working Australians through personal income tax while taxes on wealth – such as capital gains and land taxes – contribute a relatively small proportion, in part due to generous concessions.</p> 
  <p>That wealth can be passed on virtually tax-free, entrenching generational equality and making it harder for people without privileged upbringings to achieve financial security.</p> 
  <p>At the last two federal elections, Labor was assailed by scare campaigns claiming they would institute “death taxes” if elected, despite having no plans to resurrect an inheritance tax. Australia Institute chief economist <strong>Greg Jericho</strong> said such proposals are easy to malign, despite the fact they would benefit most of the population, because average Australians are sold an aspirational dream.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Emergency warning over Tasmania bushfire</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Communities are bracing as an out-of-control bushfire bears down on Tasmania’s west coast, with more than 20 blazes raging as weather conditions rapidly change, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Residents and visitors to Corinna were issued with an emergency warning last night and told to take shelter. The blazes put people and homes at high risk, authorities warned.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Corinna and surrounds is currently at high risk. The fire is travelling towards Corinna. Burning embers may threaten your home before the main fire arrives. Smoke and ash may make it difficult to see and breathe.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Schools were closed and evacuation centres established. Residents were urged to avoid using hoses and sprinklers unless an ember attack directly threatened their property.</p> 
  <p><strong>Scott Vinen</strong> from the Tasmanian fire service said embers had begun to descend on the town, which prompted an emergency warning.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have had embers in and around Zeehan with smoke. We do have some firefighting resources in the area who will be patrolling and looking out for any ember attacks.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Watch and act alerts were in place for Sandy Cape, Pieman Heads, Conical Rocks, Savage River and Granville Harbour. In all, there were 25 bushfire warnings issued across Tasmania.</p>

  <p><strong>Five new university hubs for Western Sydney, Brisbane and Logan</strong></p> 
  <p>Western Sydney, Brisbane and Logan will be home to five new university study hubs to bring the outer suburbs closer to higher education.</p> 
  <p>Labor will announce the locations of the study hubs today, which were a key recommendation of the Universities Accord to encourage university attainment among under-represented outer suburban Australians.</p> 
  <p>They will be located in Fairfield, Mt Druitt and Liverpool in western Sydney, Inala in Brisbane and Beenleigh in Logan.</p> 
  <p>They add to 10 existing suburban university study hubs, with all 15 expected to be open by late 2025, offering campus-style facilities for students undertaking a degree. Some 56 regional study hubs are operating across the country.</p> 
  <p>The minister for education, <strong>Jason Clare</strong>, said almost half of people in their 20s and 30s had a university degree, but not in outer suburbs or regional Australia.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I know growing up in western Sydney I saw a lot of golden arches and KFC and Westfield but not a lot of university crests. A lot of my friends felt like university was somewhere else for someone else. I want this to change, and that means bringing university closer to where people live.</p>

  <p>A “super black” sky has provided a chilling reminder of the potential danger ahead as a destructive cyclone zeros in on Australia, according to Australian Associated Press.</p> 
  <p><strong>Tropical Cyclone Zelia</strong> is set to hit Western Australia’s Pilbara coast today, becoming a category five system with forecast wind gusts of more than 300km/h.</p> 
  <p>Shops, schools, roads and ports in WA’s north-west have closed in preparation for the “dangerous” system, with people told to take shelter.</p>

  <p><strong>Carrie McDowell</strong> called the “super black” sky over her Karratha community ominous as locals were warned to expect dangerous winds and more heavy rain.</p> 
  <p>The 22,000-strong town of Karratha sits in the region bracing for impact when Cyclone Zelia is forecast to cross the coast between Dampier and De Grey, including Port Hedland, late today. McDowell told <strong>AAP</strong>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ve not had a category five while we lived here. We had a category three in 2020 and that was really scary. I’m a bit worried about flooding.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Karratha and Port Hedland are both at risk of a direct hit, the Bureau of Meteorology warned. The bureau’s <strong>James Ashley</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is a very dangerous system that will cause significant impacts.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The New South Wales government is urging commuters to delay non-urgent travel today, amid industrial action.</p>

  <p>A NSW government spokesperson said it was looking at all its options, “including urgent legal action”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>After extensive negotiations over the last few days the unions at the last hour asked for a $4,500 bonus payment for every rail worker. This was never part of our offer, nor was it in the union’s counter offer.</em></p> 
   <p><em>We have a fair and reasonable pay offer on the table. We can’t say yes to rail unions and no to nurses. We have made that clear.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">BoM shares long-range forecast</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Warmer than average days and nights are on the cards across large parts of the country in the coming months as Australia enters autumn, the <strong>Bureau of Meteorology</strong> has revealed.</p> 
  <p>Its long-range forecast for March to May, released on Thursday evening, predicts warmer than average days are “likely to very likely” across most of the nation, with an increased change of unusually high daytime temperatures across the southern two-thirds of the country, particularly Tasmania.</p> 
  <p>Warmer than average nights are also “very likely”, alongside unusually high overnight temperatures.</p> 
  <p>The forecast also predicts above average rainfall across much of northern Australia and parts of the eastern coastline for autumn. Australia’s south is expected to fall within the typical rainfall range.</p> 
  <p>It has been a sweltering start to the year, off the back of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/02/bom-data-2024-australia-second-hottest-year-on-record">sweltering 2024</a>. January this year was Australia’s second-warmest on record, with above average weather across most of the country. Ocean temperatures are forecast to remain warmer than average in March to May.</p> 
  <p>Australia’s land surface has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/08/australia-global-warming-climate-change-data-statistics-warmed-bom-temperature-records">warmed by 1.5C since 1910</a>, according to the BoM, with the climate crisis making heatwaves longer and more intense, and increasing the number of extremely hot days.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Sydney commuters set for fresh delays</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Sydney commuters will be hit by fresh delays on the train network this morning as rail workers go ahead with their threat to run trains below the speed limits.</p> 
  <p>Trains will run 23km/h slower than usual in areas where the speed limit is over 80km/h, the <strong>Rail, Tram and Bus Union</strong> said last night in a planned protected industrial action.</p> 
  <p>The union blamed <strong>Transport for NSW</strong> for backing out of an agreement to head off the dispute, while it also said the state government had confirmed its plans to lock out workers from 12am this morning.</p> 
  <p>The Rail, Tram and Bus Union NSW secretary, <strong>Toby Warnes</strong>, said while the extent of the delays was unclear, commuters should plan for delays, and direct their anger at the NSW government for the uncertainty.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Commuters across the state should prepare for delays as a result of the NSW government’s decision to lock out its rail workers from Friday morning.</p> 
   <p>We asked the government to rescind its lockout notices to ensure services ran smoothly on Friday but unfortunately they refused. We hope that the NSW government doesn’t choose to blow this up and cause serious delays, but the reality is we can’t predict the impact.</p> 
   <p>It’s bitterly disappointing that we haven’t been able to reach a sensible agreement over the past 48 hours. We were incredibly close in negotiations but it seems there are people within Transport for NSW who are still intent on blowing this dispute up.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Sydney Trains apologised for the expected delays and said talks on a new enterprise agreement were continuing before the next Fair Work Commission hearing on Monday.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welcome</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m <strong>Martin Farrer</strong> with the best of the overnight stories and then it’ll be <strong>Emily Wind</strong> to pick up the reins.</p> 
  <p>The two main parties have been accused of a “bidding war” in their response to anti-Israeli comments by two nurses in Sydney. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/14/peter-dutton-citizenship-stripping-laws-referendum-anti-israeli-comments-nsw-nurses">But we report today</a> on the constitutional law expert who believes there could be a ceiling to <strong>Peter Dutton’s</strong> possible preferred policy of rethinking citizenship rules. <strong>Helen Irving</strong> thinks that the Coalition leader’s suggestion of stripping citizenship from people who fall foul of Australian norms could require a referendum.</p> 
  <p><strong>Khaled Sabsabi</strong>, the western Sydney artist who fled Lebanon’s civil war as a child, has been dropped from representing Australia at the 61st Venice Biennale amid criticism of his appointment. Creative Australia, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/feb/07/khaled-sabsabi-to-represent-australia-at-venice-biennale-i-felt-this-wouldnt-happen-because-of-who-i-am">only announced its pick five days ago</a>, released a statement last night saying Sabsabi had been removed because of the need to avoid “divisive debate”. The artist has portrayed the late Hezbollah leader in his art and his selection prompted questions in the federal Senate. We’ll have all the reaction as it happens today.</p> 
  <p>Sydney commuters will be hit by fresh delays on the train network this morning as rail workers go ahead with their threat to run trains below the speed limits. Trains will run 23kmh slower than usual in areas where the speed limit is over 80kmh, the Rail, Tram and Bus Union said last night in a planned protected industrial action. More coming up.</p> 
  <p>Severe Tropical Cyclone Zelia is set to make landfall on the north coast of Western Australia today. The storm has rapidly intensified since developing over the Indian Ocean and is forecast to be at its most dangerous and powerful when it hits land. Schools, ports and roads have been closed amid fears that the category five system could bring ferocious wind gusts up to 320km/h. More coming up.</p>
