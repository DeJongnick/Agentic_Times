 <h2 class="block-title">Denmark bans all civilian drone flights this week due to EU summit, transport ministry says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Denmark will ban all civilian drone flights across the country this week to ensure security as Copenhagen hosts an EU summit gathering heads of government and officials on Wednesday and Thursday, the transport ministry said on Sunday afternoon.</p> 
  <p>“Denmark will host EU leaders in the coming week, where we will have extra focus on security. Therefore, from Monday to Friday, we will close the Danish airspace to all civilian drone flights,” transport minister Thomas Danielsen said.</p> 
  <p>“In this way, we remove the risk that enemy drones can be confused with legal drones and vice versa,” he added.</p> 
  <p>A violation of the ban can result in a fine or imprisonment for up to two years, the ministry said.</p> 
  <p>Justice minister Peter Hummelgaard said in the same statement the purpose of the ban was to simplify the work of police and other authorities. “The police are on heightened alert, and our authorities must use their forces where necessary to take care of Danes and our guests.”</p> 
  <p>The statement comes after Danish authorities sighted yet more drones at several military facilities overnight (see post at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/28/ukraine-russia-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-nato-europe-latest-live-news-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68d90fc18f081f77e6af4b0b#block-68d90fc18f081f77e6af4b0b">11.48</a> for more details).</p> 
  <p>While there has been no official confirmation of who is behind the incursions, Denmark’s prime minister Mette Frederiksen has linked them to Russia’s efforts to destabilise Europe.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Moldova heads to polls in pivotal vote that could steer it closer to EU or Russia</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Pjotr Sauer is a Russian affairs reporter for the Guardian</em></p> 
  <p>Moldovans have begun voting in a pivotal parliamentary election that will decide whether the country of 2.4 million stays on its path towards EU membership or drifts back into Moscow’s orbit, amid widespread reports of Russian meddling.</p> 
  <p>The president, <strong>Maia Sandu</strong>, and her pro-western Action and Solidarity party (PAS) face a stiff challenge in Sunday’s election from an alliance of Soviet-nostalgic, pro-Russian parties led in part by the former president Igor Dodon, whom Sandu defeated in 2020.</p> 
  <p>Polls suggest PAS is likely to remain the largest party but could lose its parliamentary majority, potentially limiting Sandu’s efforts to push through changes required for EU accession.</p> 
  <p>Polling stations in the impoverished country, wedged between Ukraine and Romania, opened at 7am (5am BST) and will close at 9pm, with results expected late on Sunday.</p> 
  <p>The outcome will be closely watched in Brussels and other European capitals, where fears are high that Moscow could gain a foothold in a strategically vital region as it intensifies its hybrid war across the continent.</p> 
  <p>Casting her ballot in Chișinău, Sandu warned voters of the stakes. “Moldova, our dear home, is in danger and it needs the help of each one of you. You can save it today with your vote. Tomorrow may be too late,” she said. “The fate of our country must be decided by your vote, not by bought votes.”</p>

  <p><em>Guardian foreign correspondent Luke Harding is in Kyiv. Here is his report on the overnight strikes on Ukraine.</em></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Kyiv has experienced one of its worst bombardments since the start of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, with at least four people killed in what Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as a “vile and brutal” attack.</p> 
   <p>Russia launched about 500 drones and more than 40 missiles, Ukraine’s president said, in a bombardment that lasted more than 12 hours over Saturday night and into Sunday morning. The main targets were the Ukrainian capital and the Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv and Odesa regions.</p> 
   <p>Zelenskyy said the onslaught was the “virtual culmination” of last week’s UN general assembly meeting, at which Donald Trump express support for Ukraine. The US president called on allies to stop all Russian oil imports and promised Ukraine would “strike back”.</p> 
   <p>“This is how Russia is making its real position known. Moscow wants to continue to fight and kill and deserves only the harshest pressure in the world,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram.</p> 
   <p>“The Kremlin benefits from continuing this war and terror as long as there are energy funds and a shadow navy.”</p> 
   <p>Kyiv echoed with the sound of anti-aircraft fire early on Sunday as waves of drones arrived in a grey dawn sky. Residents scrambled to take cover as air raid sirens blared. A missile struck a row of houses in the Petropavlivska Borshchahivka district, sheering off several upper floors.</p> 
   <p>A falling concrete slab crushed and killed a 12-year-old girl. A nurse and patient also died when Kyiv’s cardiology institute suffered a direct hit. Another person was found dead buried under debris at a residential block, officials said.</p> 
   <p>“At 6am there was a huge explosion. Everything started falling on our heads,” Lolita Isakova, 24, said. “We started to run in panic. My neighbour was covered in blood. He was looking for his wife and daughter. Everyone was screaming. We could hear booms.</p> 
   <p>“Russia is a terrorist state. Fuck them.”</p>

  <p>The Kremlin has dismissed threats by <strong>Ukrainian</strong> president Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Kremlin officials should know where the bomb shelters were. Zelenskyy suggested to Axios that the centres of <strong>Russian</strong> power, like the <strong>Kremlin</strong>, were potential targets, saying that Kremlin officials “have to know where the bomb shelters are.”</p> 
  <p>“Zelenskyy is trying to demonstrate to the Europeans, who now act as the breadwinners, that he is such a brave soldier,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television in comments reported by Reuters.</p> 
  <p>When asked directly by state television’s Kremlin correspondent Pavel Zarubin how the Kremlin would perceive an attack on the centre of Russian power, Peskov said that “it’s better not to even talk about it.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">More drones observed over Danish military sites overnight for the second straight day, army says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Nato <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/27/denmark-new-drone-sightings-biggest-military-base">yesterday vowed</a> to upgrade its mission in the <strong>Baltic Sea</strong> after <strong>Denmark</strong>’s armed forces said unidentified drones were seen near the country’s military installations overnight into Saturday. </p> 
  <p>This morning, Denmark’s army said that more drones were observed over Danish military sites overnight into Sunday.</p> 
  <p>“The Armed Forces can confirm that drones have been observed at several of the Armed Forces’ locations during the night. Several capacities were deployed,” the military said in a statement early on Sunday, without providing any more details.</p> 
  <p>There have been several suspicious drone incursions near airports and critical infrastructure this week. </p> 
  <p><strong>Copenhagen Airport</strong>, the Nordic region’s busiest, closed for several hours late on Monday as several large drones were seen in its airspace, while possible drone sightings also temporarily shuttered Oslo airport in <strong>Norway</strong>. </p> 
  <p>Five smaller Danish airports, both civilian and military, were shut temporarily in the following days.</p> 
  <p>In response, Nato said it would “conduct even more enhanced vigilance with new multi-domain assets in the Baltic Sea region”. The alliance said the new assets included “intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms and at least one air-defence frigate”.</p> 
  <p>Russia is the prime suspect behind the recent drone incursions but there has been no definitive proof to back this up. Copenhagen is to host a EU summit gathering heads of government on Wednesday and Thursday, with security likely to be high on the agenda.</p>

  <p>The US president, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, said last Tuesday that he believed Ukraine could win back all territory lost to Russia, a dramatic shift from his repeated calls for Kyiv to make concessions to end the war.</p> 
  <p>Trump posted on social media soon after meeting with <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> on the sidelines of the UN general assembly gathering of world leaders.</p> 
  <p>“I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,” Trump wrote.</p> 
  <p>“With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option.”</p> 
  <p>The US president’s comments marked a sharp departure from his previous suggestions that Ukraine would never be able to reclaim all the territory that Russia has occupied since seizing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.</p> 
  <p>Russia controls 114,918 square km (44,370 square miles), or about 19% of Ukraine, and has taken 4,729 square km of Ukrainian territory in the past year, according to the DeepState map project.</p>

  <p>In an address at the UN general assembly in New York on Saturday, Moscow’s foreign minister <strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong> warned that “any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response” but insisted Russia has no intention of attacking EU or Nato member states.</p> 
  <p>In a wide-ranging speech, Lavrov said threats against Russia by western countries were becoming “increasingly common”.</p> 
  <p>“Russia has never had and does not have any such intentions” of attacking European or Nato countries, he said, after the alliance warned Russia last week it would use all means to defend against any further breaches of its airspace after the downing of Russian drones over Poland and Estonia’s report of an intrusion by Russian fighter jets (see post at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/28/ukraine-russia-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-nato-europe-latest-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d8e6b38f084553ecf45c8c#block-68d8e6b38f084553ecf45c8c">08.56</a> for more details).</p> 
  <p>“However, any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response. There should be no doubt about this among those in Nato and the EU,” Lavrov added.</p> 
  <p>Lavrov said that only the “politically blind” would expect Ukraine to one day return to the borders it had before Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, an indirect response to <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s assertion that Kyiv could retake all its occupied land from Russia.</p> 
  <p>Lavrov also singled out German Chancellor <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong>, referring to what he said was “militaristic rhetoric” and said Moscow was alarmed by remarks by politicians in EU and Nato capitals of a looming world war three as a “likely scenario.”</p> 
  <p>Ukrainian President <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> has warned that Russia will expand its aggression beyond Ukraine if not stopped.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In a post to Telegram this morning, Ukrainian President <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> said Russia launched about 500 drones and over 40 missiles in the overnight attack on Ukraine, killing at least four people.</p>

  <p>The EU has agreed to move forward with plans for a drone wall at the heart of its <strong>eastern defences</strong> as momentum grows for a €140bn loan to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> based on Russian frozen assets.</p> 
  <p>After a meeting with ministers from 10 mostly central and eastern European member states plus Ukraine on Friday, the EU’s defence commissioner, <strong>Andrius Kubilius</strong>, said a drone wall to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/23/loan-scheme-to-rearm-europe-could-be-important-breakthrough-in-ukraine-support">protect against incursions from the skies</a> was an immediate priority and core element of the bloc’s eastern flank defences.</p> 
  <p>The issue has risen up the agenda after a spate of drone incursions in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/23/drone-sightings-cause-disruption-delays-norway-denmark-airports">Denmark</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/poland-shoots-down-drones-over-its-territory-amid-russian-attack-on-ukraine-says-military">Poland</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/14/romania-reports-russian-drone-in-its-airspace-as-poland-scrambles-jets-again">Romania</a> as well as the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets while Russia continues its deadly bombardment of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Kubilius said it was urgent to have an effective detection system, including radars and acoustic sensors, as well as capabilities to intercept and destroy drones.</p> 
  <p>The commissioner acknowledged the potential mismatch in cost involved in drone defence.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>If you are using air, and air missiles from your air fighter to shoot the drone, then you are using … [a] missile which costs 1m to kill the drone which costs 10,000.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Meanwhile, the Kremlin criticised the suggestion of shooting down Russian military planes over Europe as “reckless” and “irresponsible” after Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/wednesday-briefing-what-russia-wants-with-nato-airspace-and-what-options-it-leaves-the-west">suggested alliance members should do so</a>.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Poland scrambles jets in response to Russia's attack on Kyiv</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Poland</strong>’s military said it had scrambled fighter jets in its airspace and put ground-based air defence systems on high alert in response to the Russian strikes in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>The moves were preventive and aimed at securing Polish airspace and protecting citizens, especially in areas adjacent to Ukraine, the military said.</p> 
  <p>Poland also closed the airspace near its south-eastern cities of <strong>Lublin</strong> and <strong>Rzeszow</strong> until at least 0400 GMT on Sunday.</p> 
  <p>Tensions have mounted on Nato’s eastern flank with Russia in recent weeks.</p> 
  <p>More than 20 Russian drones entered Polish airspace on the night of 9-10 September, prompting Nato jets to down some of them and western officials to say Russia was testing the alliance’s readiness and resolve.</p>

  <p>Estonia accused Russia of sending three fighter jets into its airspace last week, while Romania has come close to shooting down a drone.</p> 
  <p>The violations have prompted both Poland and Estonia to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/19/estonia-accuses-russia-of-brazen-violation-of-its-airspace"> request this month</a> that Nato open consultations under article 4 of the alliance’s treaty, which states that members will consult whenever the territory, political independence or security of any is threatened.</p> 
  <p>The talks do not automatically lead to any action, unlike Article 5 of the treaty, which states that Nato’s collective security guarantee, under which allies pledge that an attack on one member of the alliance constitutes an attack on them all.</p> 
  <p>Russia denied its planes entered Estonian airspace and said none of its drones targeted Poland.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">At least four people killed after massive Russian attack on Kyiv, officials say</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Kyiv</strong> came under heavy bombardment early on Sunday in what independent monitors said was one of the biggest Russian attacks on the Ukrainian capital since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p> 
  <p>At least four people, including a 12-year-old girl, were killed in the attacks, according to Ukrainian officials.</p> 
  <p>Timur Tkachenko, head of the capital’s military administration, had said early reports pointed to “three fatalities”, “including a 12-year-old girl killed by Russians”.</p> 
  <p>Tkachenko has since revised the toll upwards to four, as a “body of the deceased has been found”. At least 10 people were also reported injured in the attack on Kyiv.</p> 
  <p>Drones hit several regions overnight, including the southeastern <strong>Zaporizhzhia </strong>region, where at least 16 people, including three children, were injured, authorities said.</p>
