<p>The chief spokesperson for the agency overseeing mass firings as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> slash the federal workforce used her office to record fashion influencer videos even as thousands of workers were losing their jobs.</p> <p>McLaurine Pinover, communications director at the US office of personnel management (OPM), posted several Instagram videos during business hours in which she posed in different outfits, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/11/politics/opm-spokesperson-fashion-influencer-videos-invs/index.html">CNN reported</a>.</p> <p>One video was posted on 13 February, the day OPM <a href="https://www.afge.org/article/judge-sides-with-afge-saying-trumps-mass-firings-of-probationary-employees-illegal/">reportedly</a> directed several agencies to lay off thousands of employees with probationary status, including about 20 people on Pinover’s own team.</p> <p>Pinover has issued numerous statements backing moves to fire federal workers, including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/22/politics/elon-musk-employees-emails/index.html">describing</a> a controversial directive for all workers to list five things they achieve each week as “a commitment to an efficient and accountable federal workforce”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/12/education-department-firings-trump">Education department slashed in half after Trump administration mass firings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>CNN said Pinover did not respond to questions but said she deleted her Instagram account minutes after being approached for comment. Pinover’s LinkedIn page appeared to have been taken down, too.</p> <p>Videos <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/11/politics/opm-spokesperson-fashion-influencer-videos-invs/index.html">published</a> by CNN showed Pinover in her office, showing herself wearing various clothing outfits with hashtags including “#dcstyle” and “#dcinfluencer” and the song Busy Woman by Sabrina Carpenter.</p> <p>One post was made on Tuesday, the day the Department of Education announced it was cutting half its workforce, CNN said.</p> <p>Pinover may have benefited from affiliate links to buy clothes in her videos, CNN said, though it noted that she only had approximately 800 followers to her account.</p> <p>Former OPM staffers told CNN the videos were filmed in the office of the communications director, across the hall from an annex used by workers for the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), Musk’s vehicle for imposing cuts.</p> <p>One unnamed former staffer said: “I saw it, and I was like, ‘Are you kidding me, that’s my office.’ She’s the spokesperson for the agency that is advocating for the firing based on performance and efficiency of the rest of the government workforce, and she’s using government property as a backdrop for her videos.”</p> <p>Jack Miller, Pinover’s predecessor as OPM communications director under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>, said: “Your number one job as a leader is to protect and support your people. So instead of fighting tooth and nail to keep your team, we’re posting fashion videos. It’s absurd.”</p> <p>Donald K Sherman, chief counsel for the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/11/politics/opm-spokesperson-fashion-influencer-videos-invs/index.html">told CNN</a>: “It is highly problematic that while dedicated civil servants who want to work for the government are being fired for all manner of dubious reasons, or are being forced out by this administration, that someone at the agency leading that attack on the civil service is using their government job for private gain.”</p>
