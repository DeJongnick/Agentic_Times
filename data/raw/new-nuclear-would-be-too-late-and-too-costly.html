<p>The new nuclear renaissance on which you report ((<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/01/tide-turning-europe-beyond-favour-nuclear-power">Tide is turning in Europe and beyond in favour of nuclear power, 1 June</a>) may well turn out to be like the last frail one due to a set of inconvenient truths. </p> <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/">reports</a> that renewables are now <a href="https://x.com/dorfman_p/status/1802289974944944407">10 times more efficient</a> than new nuclear at CO2 mitigation; 92.5% of all new power capacity added worldwide in 2024 was from renewables, with new nuclear virtually nowhere; new nuclear builds are vastly over-cost and over-time; large reactors on offer are the same ones offered 25 years ago – no new designs have been developed this century; since all <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/06/what-are-small-modular-reactors-and-why-does-uk-want-to-build-them">small modular reactors</a> are in the design stage, industry forecasts must be treated with scepticism; and waste, proliferation and siting problems are all deeply unresolved.</p> <p>New nuclear has limited operational need and a poor business case. Even for the couple of hundred hours per year of <em>dunkelflaute</em> (low wind and low sun), it is possible to sustain a reliable power system by expanding renewable energy, rapid growth and modernisation of the electricity&nbsp; grid, faster interconnection, using electricity far more efficiently, smart energy management and deployment of today’s cost-effective storage technology.</p> <p>And, by the way, it turns out that Sizewell C new nuclear station would be <a href="https://coastal.climatecentral.org/map/14/1.5989/52.212/?theme=sea_level_rise&amp;amp;map_type=year&amp;amp;basemap=roadmap&amp;amp;contiguous=true&amp;amp;elevation_model=best_available&amp;amp;forecast_year=2040&amp;amp;pathway=ssp3rcp70&amp;amp;percentile=p50&amp;amp;refresh=true&amp;amp;return_level=return_level_1&amp;amp;rl_model=coast_rp&amp;amp;slr_model=ipcc_2021_med">almost entirely cut off</a> by climate-driven storm-surge floodwater at least once a year by the time it’s built. According to <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-02/0174/ImpactAssessment.pdf">UK government global data</a>, it takes up to 17 years to build just one nuclear station. New nuclear would be much too late and far too costly for&nbsp;the climate and energy crises.<br><strong>Dr Paul Dorfman</strong><br><em>Bennett scholar, Bennett Institute for Innovation and Policy Acceleration, University of Sussex; c</em><em>hair, Nuclear Consulting Group</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
