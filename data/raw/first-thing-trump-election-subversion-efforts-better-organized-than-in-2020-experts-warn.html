<p>Good morning.</p> <p>Experts are preparing for Donald Trump to stage an aggressive attempt to challenge the election results if he appears to be losing Tuesday’s vote, warning that such efforts will be far more organized than his attempt at overturning the result following the 2020 race.</p> <p>The former president has made it clear that he will contest the results if he loses – and election lawyers and voting rights experts say that this time, the effort to get Trump into the White House, regardless of the result, ranges from using the courts to local groups organizing election deniers to work the polls.</p> <p>From spreading the false idea that voter fraud is undercutting the election, to planning to sow chaos in states with slow vote counts, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/trump-2024-election-subversion-explainer">here are the ways that Trump</a> and his allies are organizing.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Just how close could the vote be?</strong> Analysts are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/white-house-race-armageddon-election">predicting the closest election since 2000</a>, when George W Bush won by 537 votes, and warning of the threat of civil unrest and political violence.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Trump leans into anti-migrant rhetoric in Georgia while Harris promises Michigan she will do her best to end Gaza war</strong></h2>    <p>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/us-election-donald-trump-georgia-rally">stuck to familiar territory in his final Georgia rally</a> on Sunday, criticising migrants and describing the US as “an occupied country”, while Kamala <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/kamala-harris-michigan-arab-muslim-americans">Harris used her last event in Michigan</a> to vow to “do everything in [her] power” to end the Gaza war.</p> <p>More than 4 million Georgians – a record – voted early this year, and the swing state appears to be balanced on a knife edge. At his rally in the city of Macon, Trump appeared on stage an hour and a half late and promised to pursue the death penalty for undocumented immigrants who kill a US citizen. He also vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1790, the law under which Japanese, Italian and German-Americans were interned during the second world war.</p> <p>Meanwhile, anger over the Biden administration’s position on the Israel-Gaza war means that many of Michigan’s 240,000 registered Muslim voters are leaning towards the Green party candidate, Jill Stein, polling suggests.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Where will Trump and Harris be on the final day of campaigning?</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/04/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-polls-latest-live-news?page=with:block-672847a28f08b3d97c364c41#block-672847a28f08b3d97c364c41">Harris will be in three cities in Pennsylvania</a>; Trump will make appearances in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Judge rules Iowa can challenge validity of hundreds of ballots from potential non-citizens</strong></h2>    <p>A federal judge has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/us-election-iowa-challenge-validity-ballots-noncitizens">ruled that Iowa can carry on challenging</a> the validity of potential noncitizens’ ballots, despite warnings from civil liberties groups that this may jeopardize the voting rights of recently naturalized US citizens.</p> <p>The US district judge Stephen Locher sided with the state in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of an Iowa Latino group and four recent citizens who had been added to a list of questionable registrations. The ruling is a boon for Republicans – Donald Trump has made voting by non-citizens a campaign issue, despite it being rare.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>How many people could be affected?</strong> While the judge said their names won’t be taken off electoral rolls, potentially 2,000 could be required to use provisional ballots.</p></li> </ul>    <ul> <li><p><strong>What are the latest polls saying?</strong> The margins are razor-thin.
