That may not be a surprise for anyone who has tried to navigate the planning permission system in recent times, but is something of a vindication for housebuilding firms.</p> <p>The original study was also looking into the industry’s use of landbanks, with early suggestions being whether builders were stockpiling land and artificially slowing delivery. The conclusion instead is that land-banking is a consequence of the slow planning process – i.e. it might make sense to carry multiple years’ worth of land on balance sheet if planning takes years to complete. Housebuilders will be relieved that their strategy has avoided this blame.</p> <p>However, the other headline – that housebuilders may have shared information regarding pricing, incentives and sales rates – is more troubling. While it is not named as a primary factor in the under-delivery of new homes, it is still possible that firms are found to have broken the law, and fines may be levied as a result. It is difficult to judge the probability of this outcome.</p> <p>While the property market does not have a reputation for arch-secrecy, it’s also unlikely that a series of “smoking gun” emails will be found in senior executives’ email accounts. How strong a conclusion the investigation comes to, and what the impact on the housebuilding firms will be, remains to be seen.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-65dc6f548f08cc31668ee2a4" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-02-26T11:08:50.348Z">11.08am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">UK retail sales slump eases in February</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Just in: the slump in UK retail sales has eased this month, which may lift hopes that the economy is escaping recession.</strong></p> <p>The CBI has reported that retail sales fell at a modest pace in the year to February, with a net balance of -7% of retailers reporting a fall in sales rather than a rise.</p> <p>That is a pick-up on the “rapid decline” of -50% iin the year to January, and is the weakest fall since retail sales started sliding 10 months ago.</p> <p><strong>Martin Sartorius, CBI </strong>principal economist, explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“The slump in retail activity eased in February following an exceedingly dreary start to the year. Nevertheless, with sales expected to continue falling next month, retailers are still planning to reduce headcount and investment going forward.</p> <p>Many retailers will expect to see further pressure on their margins due to the upcoming hikes in business rates and the National Living Wage.

As a result, more than half a million 18-24-year-olds were prescribed anti-depressants in 2021-22.<br></p></li> <li><p>Young people with mental health problems are more likely to be out of work than their healthy peers. Between 2018 and 2022, one-in-five (21 per cent) 18-24-year-olds with mental health problems were workless, compared to 13 per cent of those without mental health problems.<br></p></li> <li><p>Universities have become hotbeds for mental health problems: the share of young full-time students with a CMD has increased at a far faster rate than that of working or out-of-work young people (up 37 per cent, compared to 15 per cent and 23 per cent respectively).<br></p></li> <li><p>Non-graduates with mental health problems are particularly disadvantaged in the labour market. One-in-three young non-graduates with a CMD were workless, compared to 19 per cent of non-graduates without mental health problems, and 17 per cent of graduates with a CMD.<br></p></li> <li><p>A shocking four-in-five (79 per cent) 18-24-year-olds who are workless due to ill health only have qualifications at GCSE-level or below, compared to a one-third (34 per cent) of all people in that age group. <br></p></li> <li><p>Mental health problems are blighting young people’s education.

The report highlights that many planning departments are under resourced, some do not have up to date local plans, and don’t have clear targets or strong incentives to deliver the numbers of homes needed in their area. They are also required to consult with a wide range of statutory stakeholders – these groups often holding up projects by submitting holding responses or late feedback to consultations on proposed developments.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Speculative Private Development: </strong>the report found another significant reason behind under delivery of homes are the limitations of private speculative development. The evidence shows that private developers produce houses at a rate at which they can be sold without needing to reduce their prices, rather than diversifying the types and numbers of homes they build to meet the needs of different communities (for example providing more affordable housing).<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Land Banks:</strong> the CMA assessed over a million plots of land held by housebuilders and found the practice of banking land was more a symptom of the issues identified with the complex planning system and speculative private development, rather than it being a primary reason for the shortage of new homes.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Private Estate Management: </strong>the CMA found a growing trend by developers to build estates with privately managed public amenities – with 80% of new homes sold by the eleven biggest builders in 2021 to 2022 subject to estate management charges. These charges are often high and unclear to homeowners. Whilst the average charge was £350 – one-off, unplanned charges for significant repair work can cost thousands of pounds and cause considerable stress to homeowners. The report highlights concerns that many homeowners are unable to switch estate management providers, receive inadequate information upfront, have to deal with shoddy work or unsatisfactory maintenance, and face unclear administration or management charges which can often make up 50% or more of the total bill.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Quality: </strong>housebuilders don’t have strong incentives to compete on quality and consumers have unclear routes of redress.<strong> </strong>Analysis also suggests that a growing number of homeowners are reporting a higher number of snagging issues (at least 16).
