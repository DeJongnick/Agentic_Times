<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is ratcheting up pressure on the Federal Reserve to remove governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she had “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/lisa-cook-trump-resign-fed-reserve-governor">no intention of being bullied</a>” into stepping down.</p> <p>Cook, who was appointed to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve">US central bank’s powerful</a> board of governors by Joe Biden, has been accused by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s officials of committing mortgage fraud. The allegations are unconfirmed.</p> <p>The US president has waged an extraordinary war on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/01/trump-jerome-powell-tariffs-federal-reserve">Fed’s independence</a>, breaking with precedent to demand interest rate cuts and urge its chair, Jerome Powell, to resign. Trump promptly called on Cook to quit on Wednesday.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/lisa-cook-trump-resign-fed-reserve-governor">Fed governor urged by Trump to resign will not be ‘bullied’ into stepping down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Department of Justice is reported to have indicated it is investigating the allegations, with a top Trump official telling Powell the case “requires further examination” – and calling on him to remove Cook from the Fed’s board.</p> <p>“At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms Cook from your Board,” Ed Martin, the official, wrote in a letter, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-21/doj-to-investigate-federal-reserve-s-cook-urging-removal">Bloomberg News</a>. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.”</p> <p>The Fed declined to comment. The justice department declined to comment.</p> <p>Despite Martin’s demand, the Fed chair has no authority under the Federal Reserve Act to remove another member of the board of governors. On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/fed-lisa-cook-trump-244c22c2">the Wall Street Journal</a> reported that Trump had discussed how to fire Cook for cause, citing an unnamed administration official.</p> <p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the report.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, Bill Pulte, head of the US Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has become – beyond the president himself – one of the Trump administration’s most vocal critics of Powell and the Fed, published allegations against Cook.</p> <p>Pulte says the finance agency is investigating a third property owned by Cook.</p> <p>In June 2021, Cook entered into a 15-year mortgage agreement on a property in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and declared her intention to use it as her principal residence, according to Pulte. In July 2021, Cook bought a property in Atlanta, Georgia, and also committed to use that property as her primary residence when taking out a 30-year mortgage, according to Pulte.</p> <p>In a statement, Cook said: “I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”</p> <p>She is the latest figure to be targeted by Trump officials over claims of mortgage fraud. Pulte has made <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-mortgage-fraud-allegation/">similar allegations</a> about the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and the California senator Adam Schiff, both Democrats. The justice department is reportedly investigating.</p> <p>James has dismissed the claims as “<a href="https://www.syracuse.com/state/2025/04/ny-ag-calls-fraud-accusations-baseless-retaliation-for-trump-lawsuit.html">baseless</a>”, while Schiff has vehemently denied the allegations, and accused the administration of weaponizing the US justice system.</p>
