<p>Congressman Sean Casten, Democrat of Illinois, <a href="https://casten.house.gov/imo/media/doc/gaetz_report_resolution_december_2024.pdf">introduced a privileged resolution</a> on Tuesday demanding the House ethics committee release its investigative report on former representative Matt Gaetz, even after Gaetz withdrew from consideration after being nominated to be Donald Trump’s attorney general, amid sexual scandal.</p> <p>Casten’s resolution calls for immediate public disclosure of the committee’s draft report, including conclusions, recommendations and supporting materials, with provisions to protect sensitive information and witness identities.</p> <p>The ethics committee’s investigation was centered around serious allegations against Gaetz, including potential sexual misconduct, inappropriate congressional behavior, misuse of campaign funds, using illicit drugs, and possible bribery. Gaetz has consistently denied these claims.</p> <p>Casten’s move <a href="https://casten.house.gov/media/press-releases/casten-nearly-100-house-democrats-urge-ethics-committee-to-release-gaetz-report">came weeks after he led</a> 97 House Democrats in signing a letter requesting the report’s release. In this case, the resolution will force a House vote within two legislative days, though Republican leadership is expected to resist.</p> <p>Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has opposed releasing the report in the past, arguing that ethics investigations typically conclude when a member leaves Congress. Gaetz resigned from the House as soon as Trump nominated him to become attorney general, and when he stepped aside eight days later after it was clear he would struggle to be confirmed even with a Republican majority in the Senate, he indicated he would not seek to return to Congress.</p> <p>However, Casten has often pointed to previous cases, <a href="https://ethics.house.gov/press-release/statement-chairman-and-ranking-member-regarding-former-representative-eric-massa">such as the 2011 investigation</a> of former Representative Eric Massa, where investigations continued after a member’s resignation.</p> <p>“The committee on ethics has, on many occasions, released its reports on former members,” Casten said in a statement. “Resigning from Congress should not allow members to avoid accountability for allegations as serious as those faced by Matt Gaetz.”</p> <p>Johnson’s office did not reply to a request for comment on whether his stance has changed. The Republican ethics committee chair, Michael Guest, declined to comment when asked if the committee would now release the report.</p> <p>Congresswoman Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the committee, declined to comment.</p> <p>The ethics committee meeting is scheduled for Thursday to discuss next steps concerning the congressional investigation.<br></p>
