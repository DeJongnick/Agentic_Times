Thank you for reading the updates and commenting below the line. You can stay up to date with the Guardian’s UK politics coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics">here</a>.</p> <p>Here is a summary of today’s developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The foreign secretary has defended children as young as 13 needing digital ID</strong>. Asked by LBC whether she supported the Department for Science Innovation and Technology’s consultation on digital ID for young children, Yvette Cooper said: “Lots of 13-year-olds already do [have a form of digital ID], and what the department is going to be consulting on is exactly how that should be taken forward.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Cooper said there are no plans for British or European troops in Gaza after the ceasefire.</strong> Cooper told the news programme: “That’s not our plan, there’s no plans to do that.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UK government needs to work with China, but there are a “whole series of security threats”, the foreign secretary has said. </strong>Asked whether China was a “friend or foe”, speaking on LBC, Cooper said the government had been “clear” that “there’s a whole series of security threats that have come from China”, but added: “They are also, of course, an important trading partner, and also they’re somebody that we need to work with on things like climate change.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Lib Dems called digital ID for children as young as 13 “sinister” and a “step towards state overreach”.</strong> Responding to reports that the government is considering rolling out mandatory digital ID for children as young as 13, Victoria Collins, Liberal Democrat science, innovation and technology spokesperson said:“This is proof that the Liberal Democrats were absolutely right to warn about mission creep.”</p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/10/starmer-accused-pushing-out-progressive-allies-no-10-shake-up">Keir Starmer has been accused of pushing some of his last remaining progressive allies out of government</a> as he embarks on another shake-up of his Downing Street operation designed to empower his chief secretary, Darren Jones. </strong>The prime minister is overseeing a reorganisation of several key parts of his government, including the delivery and policy units, to refocus the policy work and give Jones more direct control of the machinery of government.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ash Regan, the only MSP at Holyrood representing the late Alex Salmond’s Alba party, has quit to sit as an independent. </strong>After Salmond died suddenly last year, Regan ran to replace him but was beaten by former MP Kenny MacAskill. Regan said in her resignation letter that she believed the party “had chosen a different path” and would now focus on her members’ bill to criminalise those who buy sex.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Nigel Farage has described a former senior figure in his party who has been convicted of taking pro-Russian bribes as a “bad apple”</strong>. Speaking at a campaign visit in Caerphilly on Friday, Farage said he was “shocked” by Nathan Gill’s admissions that he had taken bribes to make statements in favour of Vladimir Putin’s Russia while he was a member of the European parliament.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A former British diplomat has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/10/former-british-diplomat-craig-murray-challenges-palestine-action-ban-scotland">served a petition challenging the ban on Palestine Action in Scotland</a>. </strong>The case, brought by Craig Murray, is separate to the judicial review of the proscription decision <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/30/palestine-action-co-founder-wins-permission-to-challenge-ban">being brought at the high court in London</a> and could lead to a situation whereby the ban is ruled unlawful in Scotland but not in England and Wales.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The leader of Plaid Cymru has said the party would bring “new energy” to the Senedd after 26 years of Welsh Labour in power, ahead of the party’s annual conference.</strong> The party conference will be held in Swansea until Saturday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ap Iorwerth also said that next year’s Welsh parliament elections will be a two-horse race between his party and Reform UK. </strong><a href="https://senedd.wales/people/rhun-ap-iorwerth-ms/">Ap Iorwerth</a> said voters could choose to back Plaid’s vision of a progressive Wales or face the division upon which Reform thrives.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Senior Scottish National party strategists believe <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/10/snp-holyrood-scottish-parliament-election-party-conference">a majority at next year’s Holyrood elections is “within reach”</a> despite failing public trust in Scotland’s government as they focus in on the “battleground cohort” of independence supporters who have drifted away from the SNP. </strong>Before the party’s annual conference in Aberdeen this weekend, one senior source said the path to a majority – by winning 65 seats or more – was “more straightforward now” than it had been for a long time because of the Tory collapse and Labour’s unpopularity.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Bridget Phillipson is pushing the prime minister and chancellor to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/09/phillipson-presses-starmer-and-reeves-to-abolish-two-child-benefit-cap-in-full">scrap the two-child benefit cap entirely in next month’s budget</a>, with the education secretary telling the Guardian the evidence is clear that it needs to be removed. </strong>Phillipson, who is finalising a report to Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves on child poverty, said abolishing the cap was the most cost effective way to make lives better for young disadvantaged people.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Scottish government will have to make its land reform bill more radical to ensure support from the Greens, the party’s co-leader has said</strong>. The land reform (Scotland) bill will go before MSPs for a final vote later this month, after what is expected to be multiple marathon sessions to consider more than 400 amendments.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/10/foreign-office-chief-to-visit-china-after-collapse-of-high-profile-espionage-case">head of the Foreign Office will travel to China next week</a> as ministers come under pressure over the collapse of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/02/uk-cps-china-official-intelligence-westminster-spy-case">high-profile espionage case</a>, the Guardian can disclose. </strong>Oliver Robbins, who as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/08/former-brexit-negotiator-oliver-robbins-expected-to-get-top-job-at-foreign-office">permanent secretary</a> of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) is its most senior civil servant, will visit China on “long-planned” government business.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Arif Ahmed, England’s higher education free speech regulator, says universities must distinguish between legitimate criticism of Israel’s government while protecting Jewish students from harassment on campus, in an interview about student protests. </strong>Ahmed, the Office for Students’ (OfS) director for freedom of speech, said the regulator was “deeply concerned” about antisemitism on campus. In an interview on the BBC’s Today programme, Ahmed said the OfS was “prepared to act” against any university that failed to shield Jewish students as part of its duty to promote free speech.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Reform UK recorded its biggest ever byelection win in the election for the Skelton East ward for Redcar and Cleveland council on Thursday</strong>, where the party set a new vote record with 65.3% and gaining a council seat from the Tories.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey described “a stonker of a night” for his party, after the Lib Dems held two seats in byelections and gained a seat from the Consevatives in another. </strong>Parish councillor Kevin Smith beat Reform UK’s Terry Tume and the Consevative party’s Lucille Baker in the Kenn Valley (Teignbridge) council byelection within the shadow chancellor Mel Stride’s constituency.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-10T14:04:08.363Z">at 3.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68e9096f8f08e1d65d2a6dec" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/pollytoynbee"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-10T13:37:07.367Z">2.37pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Government plans to merge councils may not save money, and do nothing to solve the very real problems they face, writes <strong>Polly Toynbee</strong> in her latest opinion piece:</em></p> <p>It’s extraordinary that a profound reshaping – and shrinking – of our democracy is happening under our noses, and virtually no one notices. For baffling reasons, soon after the general election a government with a sky-high in-tray of problems embarked on a gigantic local council reorganisation no one knew about.</p> <p>It didn’t feature in the manifesto, nor in the local government secretary <strong>Steve Reed</strong>’s conference speech last week – but <strong>England</strong> has plans to axe unknown numbers of local councillors – <a href="https://www.localis.org.uk/events/reorganisation-local-government-future-english-devolution/">some estimates</a> put it at nearly 90%.<strong> </strong>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-devolution-white-paper-power-and-partnership-foundations-for-growth/english-devolution-white-paper">white paper</a> outlining these plans <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/devolution-revolution-forges-ahead-with-more-powers-for-mayors">actually boasts</a> that there will be “fewer local politicians”, pandering disgracefully to the general scorn for politics. Yet voters trust <a href="https://neweconomics.org/2024/04/voters-twice-as-likely-to-trust-local-politicians-to-improve-their-area-polling-shows">councillors twice as much</a> as they do <strong>Westminister</strong> politicians.</p> <p>For all the talk of localism and connecting to neighbourhoods, these are the unheralded foot soldiers of democracy. It is councillors who run political parties and much that binds their communities<strong>. </strong>Few people ever join political parties, yet the whole tottering democratic system relies entirely on those who do. Running the council and becoming a councillor is part of party members’ purpose and motivation. Abolishing so many will diminish democratic engagement over time.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/10/local-government-democracy-axing-councillors-councils">English democracy relies on local councillors.

After attempting to return to work from maternity leave after having Zharia-Rae, she was told she was not eligible to work in the UK.</p> <p>“My manager told me that there’s a new feature at work. You have to upload the documents on to an app. And that needs to be done before you can return to work.

It’s a good place to be,” they said.</p> <p>With <strong>Scottish Labour</strong> battling to end the SNP’s nearly 20-year-long domination, both parties are focused on the “soft yes” voters. These are people who were attracted by Labour’s “kick out the Tories” message during the 2024 general election, but are no longer SNP loyalists.</p>    <p>“That’s the battleground cohort that Labour is battling to hold on to and the SNP is fighting to take,” said another senior source, who batted away Scottish Labour claims the nationalists were simply retreating to their core vote by putting much greater emphasis on independence. They said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This is not a core-vote strategy. That’s the battleground vote and how that plays out is the difference between us getting 55 seats and upwards through to us getting something around 65.</p> </blockquote> <p>Senior figures argue this strategy takes advantage of a deeply fractured opposition that is dividing the non-SNP vote, and the impact of changing dynamics at <strong>Westminster</strong> – they credit the Scottish first minister, <strong>John Swinney</strong>, for differentiating himself as pro-immigration and a progressive tax reformer.</p> <p>Swinney emphasised this on Wednesday as he launched a Scottish government policy paper on independence.

She replied: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>What we’ve had so far is now the detailed agreement on the first phase that was around five of the 20 points of the plan that was set out have now been agreed to in detail as part of phase one. </p> <p>The first thing is that that has to be implemented, and there’s a huge amount of work, particularly on the humanitarian aid.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about reports of continued bombing inside Gaza, Cooper said the government wants to see “a complete end to all fighting” immediately.</p> <p>Cooper, who is on the media round this morning, told Radio 4’s Today Programme that the ceasefire in Gaza must be the beginning of the end of the war.</p> <p>The foreign secretary said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This has to be the beginning of the end of the war, and the delivery of a just and lasting peace, of security for Palestinians and Israelis alike. </p> <p>We’ve had two agonising years of suffering, tens of thousands of lives lost, hostages being held far away from their families for two years.</p> </blockquote> <p>Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Cooper said there are no plans for <strong>British or European troops</strong> in Gaza after the ceasefire. Cooper told the news programme:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>That’s not our plan, there’s no plans to do that. </p> <p>But there is an immediate proposal for the US to lead what is effectively like a monitoring process to make sure that this happens on the ground, to oversee the process with hostage release, and also making sure that this first stage is implemented, getting the aid in place, but they have also made very clear that they expect the troops on the ground to be provided by neighbouring states, and that is something that we do expect to happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cooper said there are international discussions on an “international security force” and the UK was continuing to contribute in other ways, including looking at getting private finance into Gaza.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68e8bf5e8f08a99f0492795a" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-10T08:19:04.401Z">9.19am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The leader of <strong>Plaid Cymru</strong> has ruled out holding a referendum on independence in the next five years if he became first minister, reports the PA news agency.</p> <p><strong>Rhun ap Iorwerth</strong> told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: </p> <p>This isn’t an independence election coming up in May next year.
