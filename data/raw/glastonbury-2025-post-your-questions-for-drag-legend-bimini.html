<p>Roll up, roll up! This year you can find the Guardian’s ringleaders – OK, <em>interviewers</em> – from Friday through to Sunday at noon on the Astrolabe stage, with cracking conversation between culture’s most exciting minds and our journalists Zoe Williams and Miranda Sawyer.</p> <p>On Saturday, get up close and magical with the illusionist formerly known as Dynamo, AKA <strong>Steven Frayne</strong>, fresh from his 47-date residency in Soho. Here’s hoping he can magic away any lurking rain clouds. Then on Sunday, it’s garage-rock rapscallions <strong>Pete Doherty and Carl Bar</strong><strong>â</strong><strong>t</strong> of the Libertines, who’ll be talking to us before they dash off to their Pyramid stage performance.</p> <p>Kicking things off on Friday, <strong>Bimini</strong><strong> </strong>will be charting their rise from their breakout moment on RuPaul’s Drag Race in 2021 to being a multi-hyphenate punk-drag storyteller – pop artist, podcaster, published author, you name it. The Great Yarmouth-born, non-binary fashionista has become a key advocate of activism through drag and for the LGBTQIA+ community. Expect a frank conversation featuring their trademark wit, as they discuss anything from the power of drag and life outside the gender binary to how to pull off the best festival fit and look fierce in the shower queue.</p> <p>Want to hear their hot takes? Let us know! Please post your questions in the comments section below and the best will get asked on stage. And if you can’t be on the front row this year, you’ll be able to read what happened – and what our guests got grilled with – later on the Guardian’s website.</p>
