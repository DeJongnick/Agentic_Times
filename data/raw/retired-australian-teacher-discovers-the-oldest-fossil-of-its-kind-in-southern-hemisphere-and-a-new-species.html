<p>As a boy, holidaying with his family in the New South Wales coastal town of Gerringong, Robert Beattie found a shell in a rock. It turned out to be hundreds of millions of years old – a Permian fossil, common to the <a href="https://australian.museum/learn/australia-over-time/fossils/sites/common-fossils-of-the-sydney-basin/">Sydney basin</a>.</p> <p>“I couldn’t believe it,” Beattie recalls. “I’ve been interested in fossils ever since.” That childhood discovery, made in 1948, sparked a lifelong passion for palaeontology, one that that has taken him to dig sites across Australia’s eastern states, seen him present his findings internationally – and discover a fossil that changes what we know about how insects evolved.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/13/deceptively-cute-ancient-whale-with-razor-sharp-teeth-and-eyes-the-size-of-tennis-balls-discovered-in-australia">‘Deceptively cute’ ancient whale with razor-sharp teeth and eyes the size of tennis balls discovered in Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For all of his professional life, Beattie worked as a science and agriculture teacher, spending his weekends and spare time collecting fossils – and, in the 1960s, studying palaeontology at Macquarie University.</p> <p>Since his late teens, Beattie has had an association with the Australian Museum, bringing to the institution’s front desk specimens he collected on his expeditions – fish fossils extracted from the rubble of an old sewer tunnel near Longueville on Sydney’s lower north shore; insects from fossil beds at Belmont, near Newcastle.</p> <p>When he retired from teaching at age 59, Beattie devoted himself full-time to his passion. In 2016, he gave a talk at a conference in Edinburgh, about some tiny insects he had found at Talbragar, a fossil site in NSW’s central tablelands.</p>    <p>His presentation caught the eye of Dr Viktor Baranov, a palaeontologist at the Doñana Biological Station in Spain. “He said: you know those things you had up on the screen? They are midges,” Beattie recalls.</p> <p>In early 2020, before Covid shut Australia’s borders, Baranov visited the Australian Museum, where Beattie’s undescribed specimens were held.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/10/sign-up-for-the-clear-air-australia-environment-newsletter-with-adam-morton?CMP=copyembed">Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>After years of work, scientists confirmed that the fossilised specimens were about 151m years old, dating from the Australian Jurassic period, and that what Beattie had discovered was a new species of non-biting midge – the oldest fossil of its kind in the southern hemisphere.</p> <p>The findings, described in a research paper published in the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X25002886?via%3Dihub#s0125">Gondwana Research</a>, challenge what the researchers say are long-held assumptions about how that group of insects evolved.</p>    <p>“Robert collected these fossils over about a 10-year period,” says study co-author Dr Matthew McCurry, of the Australian Museum. “We really didn’t understand the importance until we started studying them quite recently.”</p> <p>The specimens belong to the Podonominae subfamily of midges; the oldest known fossils had previously come from China and Siberia, which had led scientists to assume the freshwater animals originated from the northern ancient supercontinent of Laurasia.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>We’re putting so much more effort into finding fossils in the northern hemisphere – that results in biases</p> <footer> <cite>Matthew McCurry, Australian Museum</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Beattie’s find, according to the new study, suggests the insects likely originated in the southern hemisphere, on the supercontinent of Gondwana.</p> <p>Podonominae are insects that feed on nectar rather than blood, and are still found around the world today. “They’re still very ecologically important,” McCurry says. About 80% of biodiversity of the group today is found in the southern hemisphere, adding weight to the Gondwanan origin hypothesis.</p> <p>McCurry says a strong geographical bias in fossil research has skewed scientific understanding of evolutionary origins.</p> <p>“If you look at any map of where fossils are being found, the hotspots are always in the northern hemisphere … it’s where there’s a lot of palaeontologists working, it’s where there’s a lot of money funding palaeontology,” he says. “We’re putting so much more effort into finding fossils in the northern hemisphere – that results in biases in our understanding of the past as well.”</p> <p>“This midge in particular … is an example of the fact that when we actually do look in the southern hemisphere, there are fossils to find, and they can start to correct that understanding.”</p> <p>The team named the new species <em>Telmatomyia talbragarica</em>, translating to “fly from the stagnant waters”.</p> <p>“[The fossil site] seems to have been a mud pond of some kind, so we have insects at all stages of their development from there,” Beattie says.</p> <p>At 82, the avid fossil hunter, now a research associate at the Australian Museum, has no intention of slowing down; he has a field trip planned next month to Penrose, in the NSW southern highlands.</p> <p>When asked about how it feels to discover a fossil with noteworthy evolutionary implications, Beattie is unbothered. “Oh, we all do it,” he says. “Lots of people find all sorts.”</p>
