<p>A manhunt is under way for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/27/porepunkah-shooting-suspect-dezi-freeman-victoria-police-ntwnfb">Dezi Freeman</a>, a 56-year-old so-called “sovereign citizen” accused of killing two police officers and injuring another in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria">Victorian</a> town of Porepunkah, which is home to about 1,000 people.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/aus_shooting_satellite/giv-3255447399MU7frA4/" data-alt="A map depicting the site of the shooting in Porepunkah"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/aus_shooting_satellite/giv-3255447399MU7frA4/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Here’s what we know so far:</h2> <ul> <li><p>About 10.30am on Tuesday, 10 police were attending a rural property in Porepunkah to execute a search warrant when they were fired upon.</p></li> <li><p>Two officers were killed and another was wounded. The officers killed were detective leading senior constable <strong>Neal Thompson</strong>, 59, and senior constable <strong>Vadim De Waart</strong>, 35.</p></li> <li><p>Thompson, who was on the verge of retirement, joined Victoria police in 1987 and spent seven years in general duties at Collingwood police station before working as a detective at the major fraud squad and the state crime squad. De Waart had only recently arrived in Wangaratta when the shooting occurred. He started his policing career at the Victoria police academy in late 2018 and worked for three years at St Kilda police station before joining the public order response team as a senior constable in April 2023.</p></li> <li><p>The police officer who was wounded has had surgery. On Thursday morning he remained in a stable condition at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne, a hospital spokesperson confirmed.</p></li> <li><p>According to the chief commissioner of Victoria police, <strong>Mike Bush</strong>, the officers were<strong> </strong>“met by the offender, and they were murdered in cold blood”.</p></li> <li><p>On Wednesday, Bush named the suspect as 56-year-old <strong>Dezi Freeman</strong>, or<strong> Desmond Filby</strong>, whom he described as “heavily armed” and said he “understands bushcraft well”. He said Freeman had been able to run into the bush near the property alone immediately after the shooting.</p></li> </ul> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <ul> <li><p>Bush said it was believed Freeman was armed with multiple firearms, including long arms. He said police were still examining the scene to understand whether he took any additional weapons from police. The area around the town, about 300km north-east of Melbourne, is steep and mountainous.</p></li> <li><p>On Wednesday afternoon police released a new image of Freeman and a description of him as Caucasian, 183cm tall, with medium build, short dark hair and brown eyes.</p></li> <li><p>Police said he was last seen wearing “dark green (khaki) tracksuit pants, dark green rain jacket, brown Blundstone boots and reading glasses”.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/27/porepunkah-shooting-suspect-dezi-freeman-victoria-police-ntwnfb">Freeman has a history of association with pseudolaw</a> and “sovereign citizen” ideas. Bush would not confirm this but said he was known to police before the shooting.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2Fvic_map.png&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2F250826VicMapShooting_loop.mp4" data-alt="map of Victoria showing location of Porepunkah"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2Fvic_map.png&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2F250826VicMapShooting_loop.mp4">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>How has the search for Dezi Freeman unfolded?</h2> <ul> <li><p>Police have deployed hundreds of specialist resources, including air and ground, to find him.</p></li> <li><p>On Tuesday Bush described the suspect’s address as a semi-rural property with a bus on site, which housed the alleged offender, his partner and children.</p></li> <li><p>Bush described the search area as “very wide”, with Freeman likely to “know that area better than us”. He said there had been no sightings of him since he fled into the bush on Tuesday.</p></li> <li><p>The Police Association Victoria chief executive, <strong>Wayne Gatt</strong>,<strong> </strong>said “hundreds of our members” were continuing to “put themselves in danger right as we speak” in an attempt to apprehend the suspect.</p></li> <li><p>The Victorian premier, <strong>Jacinta Allan, </strong>said Wednesday evening there were “huge resources” being put on the ground in North East Victoria. New South Wales police have also offered support.</p></li> <li><p>On Thursday afternoon, the Australian federal police confirmed it was providing assistance to the Porepunkah operation at the request of Victoria police. Guardian Australia understands that officers from the tactical response team have been deployed.</p></li> <li><p>The state’s police minister, <strong>Anthony Carbines</strong>, on Thursday said Bush had not requested additional financial support, while interstate police had provided technical and specialised assistance. He said the force was throwing “everything” at the search and the government had pledged “anything” it needs.</p></li> <li><p>Deputy commissioner regional operations, <strong>Russell Barrett</strong>, on Thursday said “every available asset” was being put into the manhunt. “We will not rest until we apprehend the offender,” he said.</p></li> <li><p>Barrett described the search as “protracted” owing to the “difficult terrain” police were navigating.</p></li> <li><p>Victoria police on Thursday said “severe weather” had complicated travel in the region. The Bureau of Meteorology forecast that a cold weather system could dump large amounts of snow – up to half a metre – over the Alpine mountains near the Victoria-NSW border.</p></li> <li><p>Bush said the team who went to Freeman’s property was made up of local officers and members of the sexual offences and child abuse team: “It’s a large area, so it required a large number of staff to search the area and also search for technology.”</p></li> <li><p>It was not a “hostage situation”, Bush said, as Freeman’s partner and children had attended a police station on Tuesday evening. He said police had spoken with Freeman’s partner.</p></li> <li><p>On Thursday, superintendent <strong>Brett Kahan</strong> addressed Freeman directly during a press conference, saying: “If Dezi Freeman is watching this, ring triple zero, and we will support a surrender plan.”</p></li> </ul> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/27/the-porepunkah-shooting-has-left-us-with-many-questions-one-of-them-is-how-we-confront-sovereign-citizenship">From Facebook groups to shoot-outs with police: inside the sprawling ecosystem of ‘sovereign citizens’ | Ariel Bogle</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How has the Porepunkah community been affected?</h2> <ul> <li><p>Kahan said on Thursday the Porepunkah community did not need to stay indoors but should remain vigilant.</p></li> <li><p>Police searches have been carried out on local properties, police said on Thursday. Barrett warned that anyone harbouring Freeman was committing a criminal offence.</p></li> <li><p>The local council closed all facilities “effective immediately”, and Porepunkah primary school was in lockdown for a period on Tuesday. The school reopened on Thursday morning.</p></li> <li><p>On Thursday, police advised members of the public, particularly those heading to nearby ski resorts, to avoid Porepunkah.</p></li> </ul> <h2>What has the wider reaction been?</h2> <ul> <li><p>Allan said the thoughts of “all Victorians” were with the police, saying the response showed first responders’ “extraordinary bravery and courage”.</p></li> <li><p>The prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, said his thoughts were with the “police for the work they do, each and every day”. He said “the men and women who wear the uniform of the police take risks” for everyone.</p></li> <li><p>In parliament on Thursday, the PM was joined by the leader of the opposition, <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>, and the member for Indi, <strong>Helen Haines</strong>, in paying tribute to the victims before a moment’s silence in their honour.</p></li> <li><p>The mayor of Alpine shire, <strong>Sarah Nicholas</strong>, said in a video message that Tuesday had been a day of “deep sorrow and shock” for the community: “We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of the two police officers tragically killed in Porepunkah. Our thoughts, love and unwavering support are with you during this incredibly painful time.”</p></li> <li><p>The Victorian government has offered support to the local council and the Porepunkah primary school, including trauma counselling for any students, staff and affected families.</p></li> </ul> <p>• <em>In Australia, support is available at <a href="https://www.beyondblue.org.au/">Beyond Blue</a> on 1300 22 4636 and <a href="https://www.lifeline.org.au/">Lifeline</a> on 13 11 14</em></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
