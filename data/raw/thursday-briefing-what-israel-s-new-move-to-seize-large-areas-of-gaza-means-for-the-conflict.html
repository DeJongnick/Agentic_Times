<p>Good morning. On Tuesday, Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, announced a major expansion of attacks on Gaza and the “capture of large areas that will be added to the security zones of the state of Israel”.</p> <p>The announcement followed a night of airstrikes on Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza, which officials said had killed at least 21 people, including a pregnant woman. The intensification of Israel’s offensive comes after more than two weeks of airstrikes and ground operations that have, according to Gaza’s health ministry, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g9x0kd4gro#:~:text=Israel%20accused%20Hamas%20of%20rejecting,run%20health%20ministry%20has%20said">killed more than 900 people</a>. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0r5827dke1o">Unicef has said that at least 322 </a>of those killed since the renewed attacks have been children.</p> <p>Earlier this week 15 bodies of Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, killed by Israeli forces <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/palestinian-paramedics-shot-by-israeli-forces-had-hands-tied-eyewitnesses-say">and buried in a mass grave</a>, were discovered. According to witnesses, some victims were found with their hands or legs bound and had gunshot wounds to the head and chest.</p> <p>For today’s newsletter, I spoke with the Guardian’s international security correspondent, <em><strong>Jason Burke</strong></em>, who has reported on the war since its beginning, about Katz’s announcements and what they mean for Gaza’s future. That’s right after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>UK economy</strong></em> | Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/trump-hits-uk-with-10-tariffs-as-he-ignites-global-trade-war">hit the UK with tariffs of 10% on exports to the US</a> as he ignited a global trade war. Other tariffs include 20% on the EU and 34% on China. Downing Street had been expecting 20% but Keir Starmer’s conciliation towards the Trump administration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/why-starmers-trade-diplomacy-may-still-bear-fruit-despite-10-tariffs-on-uk">appeared to have paid off</a>.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Immigration</strong></em> | An investigation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/02/investigation-launched-after-racist-message-reportedly-blasted-out-at-asylum-centre">has been launched</a> after a racist message was reportedly “blasted out” on portable radios used by Home Office contractors at an asylum processing centre. The deeply offensive broadcast – “fuck off you [N-word]s, go back to where you came from” – was reportedly heard at the Manston processing site for small boat arrivals in Kent.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Health </strong></em>| Doctors have reported a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/03/doctors-urge-government-fight-poverty-victorian-diseases">rise in the number of patients with Victorian diseases such as scabies</a>, as the Royal College of Physicians urged the government to do more to fight poverty.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>UK news </strong></em>| A third former South Yorkshire police officer has been arrested as part of an investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. The ex-constable, aged in his 50s, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/02/third-ex-police-officer-arrested-in-rotherham-child-sexual-exploitation-inquiry">was arrested on Monday</a> on suspicion of raping a teenage girl in the town in 2004. </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Education </strong></em>| The fate of boys <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/03/bridget-phillipson-education-secretary-more-male-teachers-adolescence">“is a defining issue of our time”</a>, according to the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, as she calls for more men to become teachers to combat “toxic” behaviours.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: ‘Authorities who imagine they can eradicate Hamas through force are wrong’</h2>    <p>Last week, the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for people in Rafah and a stretch of land extending north towards Khan Younis, directing them to al-Mawasi – an area on the coast that Israel once designated a humanitarian zone but which has been bombed more than 100 times between May and January, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2jld7j50eo">according to the BBC</a>. Other orders forced tens of thousands across the north of Gaza to move. Many have only just returned to their former homes, most of which are in ruins.</p> <p>The Gaza health ministry now puts the number of people killed by the Israeli offensive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/23/there-was-just-wave-after-wave-gaza-medics-recount-horror-of-the-last-week">at more than 50,000</a>, mostly civilians. In January the Lancet medical journal published a report that estimated that the death toll during the first nine months of war was approximately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/10/gaza-death-toll-40-higher-than-official-number-lancet-study-finds">40% higher</a>. International agencies estimate that at least <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/19-01-2025-the-ceasefire-in-gaza-brings-hope--but-immense-challenges-lie-ahead-to-restore-the-health-system">110,000 people</a> have been injured, often very seriously.</p> <p>The war was triggered by a Hamas surprise attack into southern Israel that killed 1,200, also mostly civilians, and led to 251 being taken hostage, of whom 59 remain in Gaza.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Capturing </strong><strong>territory</strong></p> <p>“The language expressing a definite interest in taking control of territory, without giving any kind of timeline, feels much more explicit now and that’s a change,” Jason says.</p> <p>Throughout the war, some observers have warned that Israel’s offensive in Gaza <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/29/israeli-ministers-attend-conference-calling-for-voluntary-migration-of-palestinians">could lead to annexation</a> or resettlement. Israeli officials have previously avoided explicit statements about seizing territory in Gaza. One reason was undoubtedly pressure from the Biden administration, which insisted that Israel <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67355319">should not reoccupy</a> Gaza after the conflict.</p> <p>However, things have changed following Donald Trump’s proposal to reconstruct Gaza as “the Riviera of the Middle East”, after displacing the Palestinian population to Egypt and Jordan. This prompted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/un-chief-warns-against-ethnic-cleansing-after-donald-trump-gaza-proposal">a warning against ethnic cleansing</a> from the UN secretary general, António Guterres, but appears to have emboldened Israeli authorities, which threatened last month to annex parts of the devastated territory.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/israel-announces-intention-seize-large-areas-gaza-strip">According to the Israeli rights group Gisha</a>, Israel has already taken control of around 62 square kilometres (approximately 17%) of Gaza as part of a buffer zone along its edges. In a video statement that was published on Wednesday evening, the Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces would capture a “second Philadelphi route”, referring to the narrow Israeli-held corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border. “[By] dividing up the strip, we are adding pressure step by step, so that our hostages will be given to us,” Netanyahu added. It is still not clear how much more land Israel wants to capture.</p> <p>“Of course territory could be seized simply to put pressure on Hamas during ongoing negotiations over a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, or used as a bargaining chip in any deal, or to carve out a very wide buffer zone but a lot of observers suspect other motives,” Jason says. </p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What does </strong><strong>this mean long-term?</strong></p>    <p>Any seizure of land is potentially part of a broader, long-term ideological project of the Israeli right, particularly the far right, which wants the reoccupation of Gaza, the re-establishment of settlements and the displacement of the Palestinian population.</p> <p>Once dismissed as an Israeli fringe fantasy, this project has become far more plausible following Trump’s announcement of his plan for Gaza. Since then, Israeli authorities have approved a scheme to facilitate what they call “a voluntary transfer for Gaza residents who express interest in moving to third countries”, creating a bureau to oversee it. Legal experts are clear that under any reasonable interpretation of international law, any emigration in current circumstances from Gaza would be unlawful and constitutes ethnic cleansing. Many Palestinians have also made it clear that they are determined to stay <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/09/this-time-we-stay-the-palestinian-families-vowing-not-to-leave-gaza">and reject any proposals</a> involving resettlement.</p> <p>Since the first phase of the ceasefire that was agreed in January ended at the beginning of March, Israel has blocked all humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. Israeli authorities claim this is because Hamas is diverting aid for its own benefit, which Hamas denies. Israel then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/09/israel-cut-off-electricity-gaza-hamas-ceasefire-negotiations">cut off remaining electricity</a> supplies, forcing the closure of a water desalination plant and so depriving more than 600,000 people of clean water. The UN World Food Programme has warned its supply of hot meals will last for no more than two weeks, adding that all bakeries have been forced to shut down due to a lack of fuel and flour.</p> <p>“If parts of the Israeli government and the extreme right more generally want to see ‘voluntary emigration’ from Gaza, making it unliveable is a good way to advance that project,” Jason says.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Pressuring Hamas</strong></p> <p>Negotiations are ongoing but there is a massive gap between Hamas and Israel, Jason says. Hamas wants the previous ceasefire deal upheld, with a second phase that would end the war but allow Hamas to remain effectively in power in Gaza. Israel wants any pause to be temporary, and is offering a couple of months or so of ceasefire. This makes the imminent cessation of hostilities unlikely.</p> <p>“It has to be said that Hamas has sustained massive losses,” Jason continues. “It has few cards to play in any negotiations, other than the hostages and international public opinion. The only international public opinion that can influence Israel is the opinion of one individual, and that is the occupant of the Oval Office.”</p> <p>Currently that occupant has seemingly given Netanyahu a blank cheque, and this is not universally popular in Israel. Families of hostages have expressed their dismay at the expansion of the attacks, asking whether their loved ones were being sacrificed for the sake of territorial gains and expressing concern that the mission of returning their relatives had been pushed to the bottom of the government’s priorities. A<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-70-of-israelis-support-second-phase-of-hostage-ceasefire-deal/"> recent poll</a> indicated broad Israeli support for a ceasefire deal that returns the hostages in exchange for IDF withdrawal from Gaza. “But the numbers who believe there should just be a ceasefire deal – Israeli withdrawal and Hamas stays there with its weapons – are really small,” says Jason.</p> <p>In the absence of a political plan for the administration of Gaza, “a vacuum will inevitably emerge, which Hamas or a successor organisation will fill”, he adds. “Israeli authorities who imagine they can eradicate Hamas in Gaza purely through sustained military force are wrong.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Rafael Behr has a strong, simple warning to <strong>Keir Starmer </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/02/keir-starmer-labour-prime-minister-voters">in his latest column</a>: “Labour MPs are justified in worrying that their time in government is being squandered and they will end up being remembered for all the things they failed to do.” <em><strong>Charlie Lindlar, acting deputy editor, newsletters</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>It’s the moment we’ve all been waiting for (probably): voting is open on the <strong>Guardian’s invertebrate of the year</strong> competition.
