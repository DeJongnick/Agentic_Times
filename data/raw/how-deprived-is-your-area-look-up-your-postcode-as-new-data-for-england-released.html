<p>The English Indices of Deprivation are government figures that rank every neighbourhood from the most to the least deprived. Released roughly once every five years, the ranking is based around small areas known as “lower layer super output areas” (or LSOAs) – each usually home to between 1,000 and 3,000 people.<br><br>In simple terms, it’s a national league table of deprivation. The league table ranks neighborhoods across different aspects of everyday life: income, education, health, crime, barriers to housing and services, and the environment, and combines them into one score.</p> 
<p>Areas in the middle sit roughly around the median average for England as a whole, while those at either end show where the country’s deepest inequalities - and greatest advantages - lie.<br><br>Use the box below to find out where your neighborhood ranks compared to the rest of the country – and how things have changed over the last six years. Scroll down to see where it sits on some of the main indicators:</p>
