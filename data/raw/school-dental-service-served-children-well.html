<p>In the 1960s, I trained as a dental auxiliary (later known as dental therapists). We were trained to fill in gaps in the school dental service and could do simple fillings, extractions of baby teeth and dental health education (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-dental-divide-ministers-must-brush-up-their-policy-as-well-as-childrens-teeth">The Guardian view on the dental divide: ministers must brush up their policy as well as children’s teeth, 2 September</a>). I worked for over 20 years in the school dental service. </p> <p>The school dental officer would visit every school in their area. If children needed treatment their parents were sent a card. Their children could be treated by their own dentist or in the school clinic. Every child had access to treatment. Nervous children and those with special needs were particularly well cared for. </p> <p>This service no longer exists – to the detriment of the dental health of many of our children. What are the chances of bringing back a&nbsp;school dental service now?<br><strong>Marcia Thompson</strong><br><em>Formby, Merseyside</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
