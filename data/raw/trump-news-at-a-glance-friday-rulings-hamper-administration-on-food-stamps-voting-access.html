<p>President Trump received a trio of legal setbacks Friday related to the government shutdown and his attempts to tweak voting access in US elections.</p> <p>First, two federal judges issued back-to-back rulings in separate cases ordering the administration to use contingency funds to continue paying for food stamps under the Snap program.</p> <p>One judge in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rhode-island">Rhode Island</a> blocked the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> from suspending all food aid for millions of Americans, in a case brought by a group of US cities, non-profit organizations and a trade union. At almost the same time, in a separate but similar case, a judge in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> ruled that the government must continue to fund the program that helps low-income households stave off food insecurity, in a case brought by the Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia and three governors who sued the administration.</p> <p>And later Friday, a US district judge in Washington DC ruled that Trump’s proof-of-citizenship directive to overhaul US elections was unconstitutional.</p> <p>“Because our constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the states and to Congress, this court holds that the president lacks the authority to direct such changes,” judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion.</p> <p>That’s a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in US elections.</p>  <h2>Trump administration blocked from suspending Snap benefits for millions of Americans</h2>  <p>Two federal judges issued back-to-back rulings on Friday in separate cases ordering the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> to use contingency funds to continue paying for food stamps during the government shutdown.</p> <p>A federal judge in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rhode-island">Rhode Island</a> blocked the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> from suspending all food aid for millions of Americans, in a case brought by a group of US cities, non-profit organizations and a trade union.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump can’t require citizenship proof on the federal voting form, judge rules</h2>  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled today.</p> <p>US district judge <strong>Colleen Kollar-Kotelly</strong> in Washington DC sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> over his executive order to overhaul US elections.
