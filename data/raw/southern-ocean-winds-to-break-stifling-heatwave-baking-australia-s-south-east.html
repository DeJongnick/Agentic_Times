Normally the region receives rainfalls of between 30mm to 60mm but Bradbury said a “standout” observation had been a sticky storm that formed over Mossman, near the Daintree in far north Queensland.</p> <p>“We’ve seen more than 200mm of rain overnight, and when we look down the road, we’ve only got 12mm,” she said. </p>
