You may not always agree with every detail but with Reform you know where we stand — unapologetically on the side of Britain, its people, and its armed forces.</p> <p>I did not enter politics for titles or convenience.

At the time Badenoch made it clear that she expected the report to come out in favour of withdrawal.</p> <p>It is being discussed by the shadow cabinet tomorrow, and in a speech to the Tory conference on Sunday Badenoch is expected to formally commit the party to withdrawal. The Wolfson report is intended to show that withdrawal is not just desirable, but also feasible.</p> <p>According to the extract leaked to Guido Fawkes, Wolfson says the UK joined the ECHR on only reluctantly in the early 1950s and at the time, because it had a strong tradition of common law rights, officials assumed that the UK would only occasionally be found in breach of the convention. But that has changed because the European court of human rights (ECtHR) has extended its powers beyond what was first agreed, he says.</p> <p>Wolfson argues that attempts to reform the ECtHR are “unlikely” to succeed within the next few years. And he says the UK does not need to be subject to an international court to offer proper rights protection. He says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is worth remembering that countries that inherited the British model of rights protection have continued to improve their approach to rights protection and official accountability, but done so without binding themselves to international courts. As <strong>Lord Sumption</strong> has observed: “In countries such as the United Kingdom, with independent and apolitical courts of high standing, it is unnecessary to have another tier of judicial supervision at the international level. Other countries with judicial systems similar to Britain’s, such as Canada and New Zealand, have a high reputation for defending human rights without submitting their domestic arrangements to the scrutiny of an international court. If Britain were to withdraw from the convention and re-enact the same provisions as a purely domestic instrument, it would be possible to defend all the same basic rights without submitting to the overbearing regulatory instincts of the Strasbourg court.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Wolfson</strong> argues that leaving the convention is feasible – although he does not pretend it would be easy.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The precise nuances and immediate consequences of denunciation are not without their complexities, and significant political capital will be required to effect a policy to leave the ECHR; however, this advice demonstrates that none of these complexities is insurmountable (notably, the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement is not a barrier). The form of rights protection that might follow leaving the ECHR is an open question, this advice sets out the various options that are available, and their relative merits …</p> <p>It is also important to avoid conflating the politics of leaving the ECHR with the legality of doing so. Lord Hermer KC, the attorney general for England &amp; Wales, has recently suggested - without, it seems, adducing any actual evidence - that other countries may not be willing to enter into migration or return deals with the UK if it were no longer a member of the ECHR. That is a primarily a political question, not a legal one, and is a matter for each individual country. However, insofar as other countries take the same approach as the UK, that flies in the face of the numerous migration deals that the UK has with other countries regardless of whether they are in the ECHR or not. Such comments are, in my view, designed to direct attention away from the legal difficulties created by the ECHR and the legality of leaving, which has been the focus of this advice.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wolfson also says that, in all five areas where Badenoch <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/06/labour-victory-hamilton-scotland-reform-conservatives-uk-politics-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-6842c1d18f08edac2d8696a8#block-6842c1d18f08edac2d8696a8">set her tests</a>, the ECHR imposes limits on what the government can do. But it in some of them the constraints posed by the convention are more limited. Border policy is the area where “the most urgent and extensive changes are needed”, Wolfson says.</p> <p>The Conservative party has been approached for a comment.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68de77ea8f08f91f2eb5e415" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-02T13:26:53.677Z">2.26pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Green leader Zack Polanski to use conference speech to call for wealth tax</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Kemi Badenoch is not the only party leader previewing what she is likely to say at her party conference.

For nearly two decades, the United Kingdom has led the way in tackling climate change, initially with the Climate Change Act in 2008 and again in 2019 when we became the first G7 country to legislate to get to Net Zero by 2050. </p> <p>To row back now would be a catastrophic mistake for while that consensus is being tested, the science remains the same.

Here are the main lines.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Badenoch claimed the Conservative party was close to going bust when she took over as leader last year.</strong> She said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I basically inherited a distressed asset and my first job was to just make sure we didn’t go bust. Most of my first three to six months were spent on that. I just couldn’t get out there much. The opportunity cost was perhaps not doing much media.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to her that she should have spent more time over the past year talking about policy, she said she would “rather be out raising every single penny”, not doing ‘some nice media interviews’. Asked why she couldn’t do both, she replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I don’t think people realise just how perilous the situation was.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>She said that she will give two speeches at Tory conference – a speech on Sunday setting out the party’s plans to leave the European convention on human rights, as well as the traditional end-of-conference speech on Wednesday.</strong> That is similar to what Theresa May did in 2016, when she give a speech on the Sunday about her Brexit policy. (That was the speech where she in effect committed the UK to leaving the single market and the customs unions – despite the fact she had not cleared that with cabinet.) Badenoch is going to present the ECHR plans to her shadow cabinet tomorrow.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>She claimed that most of Robert Jenrick’s ideas were hers. Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, was Badenoch’s main rival in the leadership contest last year.</strong> It is widely assumed that he is preparing to stand in another contest before the election, and he has a very active social media comment, where he is happy to comment on topics outside his brief. Asked if she was happy about Jenrick offering his views so readily, Badenoch said: ‘Yes. But most of them are my thoughts repackaged.” She also said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I don’t mind that he says what he thinks. The advantage of having a leadership contest is that you’ve kind of already said what you think. Repeating it, which is what Rob tends to do, is not new information.</p> </blockquote> <p>Badenoch is not being fair to her rival. In last year’s contest the most significant policy difference between Badenoch and Jenrick was Jenrick giving a firm commitment to withdraw from the ECHR, while Badenoch would not make that commitment. She did not rule out withdrawal, but said it was not a “silver bullet”. In Manchester next week at their conference the Tories will be adopting the Jenrick policy.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Badenoch said she wanted her shadow ministers to speak out at conference, even if that meant going beyond the official party line.</strong> She said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think people should just speak freely, no matter what the consequences are.

Interestingly, the party is talking about “replacing” the act, not just repealing it, but the Tories have not said what they would replace it with.</p> <p>The party says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The 2008 legislation has forced successive governments to introduce punitive measures that have hit family finances – including the Boiler Tax which will push up the price of gas boilers to force people to adopt heat pumps just for the purpose of meeting a self-imposed target. </p> <p>The act ignores the fact that climate change is a global problem. If the British chemicals, cement, or metals industry shuts down and moves abroad to countries with cheaper but dirtier energy, then Britain won’t need any less chemicals, cement, or metals – we will just import more from abroad instead, and lose out on all the jobs, tax revenue, and economic growth. Britain will be poorer and global emissions will increase. </p> <p>The CCA has also forced ministers to support Drax, where trees are cut down in North America, shipped across the Atlantic in diesel-chugging ships, and burnt in a power station in Yorkshire, at great cost to billpayers and our environment, because it is labelled ‘clean’ for the purposes of our climate targets. </p> <p>The UK has already halved its emissions since 1990, reducing emissions by more than any other major economy. But global emissions are rising and countries like China are not following our lead. Continuing down this path of unilateral economic disarmament will make us a warning, not an example, to the rest of the world. </p> <p>The Conservatives support action on climate change – and believe in safeguarding our environment for future generations – but this has to happen when it makes people’s lives better. People should be able to adopt electric vehicles and electric heating when they want to and when it will save them money, not when they are forced to by a government mandate. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68de3ed58f08694a84a03b8b" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-02T09:07:18.047Z">10.07am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Tory plan to scrap Climate Change Act 'backwards step' that would 'damage our economy', says CBI</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The Conservatives used to be seen as the party of business.

Businesses delivering the energy transition added £83bn to the economy last year alone, providing high-paying jobs to almost a million people across the UK. The UK’s climate governance and the cross-party consensus that has underpinned it has shaped long-term contracts to deliver renewable energy, investment in green technologies and our international leadership in decarbonisation.</p> <p>We can debate the pace of transition and how it’s achieved to ensure that decarbonisation does not come at the expense of critical industries.

But the Starmer announcement shows that, while the message from Labour conference was that Starmer is now willing to vigorously contest some aspects of Faragism, he is not rejecting it wholesale. He has set out a dividing line – but it is beyond the edge of the territory where migration liberals feel comfortable.</p> <p>One consequence of the Labour conference is that ministers now feel a lot more confident about clobbering Farage’s party and this morning we saw that from <strong>Mike Tapp</strong>, the migration minister.</p> <p>Yesterday <strong>Zia Yusuf</strong>, Reform’s head of policy, gave interviews arguing Starmer’s attack on Farage in his conference Tuesday put the Reform leader at risk. This was an odd claim from a party that invited the woman jailed for urging people to set fire to asylum hotels to address its party conference as a free speech martyr. Yusuf went even further, though. He <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/sky-news-presenter-clashes-with-zia-yusuf-over-claim-starmer-is-inciting-violence-against-farage_uk_68dcdee0e4b0f3800bcd5a7f">implied that Starmer was deliberately trying to get Farage killed.</a> This was an allegation so unhinged that the Guardian ended up covering it in <strong>John Crace</strong>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/01/conspiracy-theories-and-accusations-fly-as-labours-farage-fever-rattles-reform">sketch</a>. This is what John wrote about Yusuf’s interview with Wilfred Frost on Sky News.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Yusuf was appalled by Starmer’s speech. It had been vicious, vindictive and inflammatory. An attempt to demonise Nige. As such it had been an incitement to violence. Here was the crux of it. Starmer knew that he couldn’t beat Farage at the ballot box so he was trying to have him assassinated.</p> <p>“There’s a term known as ‘stochastic terrorism’,” Zia went on. It meant to whip up so much hatred that one supporter takes it on themselves to kill the target. And that was what Starmer had been doing. It was almost certainly the first time the prime minister has been called a terrorist on live news. Time and again, Frost invited Yusuf to back down. To qualify his language. But Zia wasn’t having any of it. Starmer was a terrorist. The one aim of his speech had been to incite someone to kill Farage. Everything else was a smokescreen. Yusuf alone knew the truth. You wonder what he makes of Nige’s speeches.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an interview with Times Radio, <strong>Tapp</strong> was asked to respond. He said the claim that Starmer wanted to incite violence against Farage was “utter nonsense”. He went on:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Of course, we want all members of parliament to be safe, and that’s absolutely important, and no-one wants any harm to come to Nigel Farage.</p> <p>But, look, if we want to say what we want to say, then we’re in our rights to do that, as are they. That’s freedom of speech.</p> <p>This is utter snowflakery from Zia Yusuf, who claims that we’re diminishing freedom of speech whilst at the same time being allowed to say what he wants.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>Morning:</em> Keir Starmer is at the European Political Community summit in Copenhagen. <strong>Jakub Krupa</strong> is covering this on his Europe live blog.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/02/epc-european-political-community-leaders-copenhagen-denmark-ukraine-russia-europe-live">European leaders meet at Denmark summit to discuss security, defence and migration – Europe live </a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>5pm:</em> Kemi Badenoch is doing a round of regional radio and TV interviews, ahead of her conference.
