<p>BP is expected to ditch a target to ramp up renewable energy generation by 2030 as part of a shift back towards fossil fuels when it presents its strategy to investors this week.</p> <p>The chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, is poised to tell shareholders that the oil and gas company is scrapping its target to increase renewable generation 20-fold between 2019 and 2030 to 50 gigawatts, Reuters reported.</p> <p>BP is also expected to ditch a target to reach underlying profits of $49bn (£38.8bn) this year and instead set an annual percentage growth target. The company previously hinted on a call with analysts that it could drop the targets. It missed its 2024 target of $40.9bn in underlying profits.</p> <p>At an investor day in London on Wednesday, the company is likely to announce plans to divest assets and cut other low-carbon investments to reduce debt and increase returns, under mounting pressure from shareholders.</p> <p>BP’s shares have fared worse than rivals in recent years and investors have become concerned about the 120-year-old company’s direction. The stock has lost almost a quarter of its market value in the past two years.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, Auchincloss promised to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/11/bp-chief-profits-murray-auchincloss-elliott">“fundamentally reset” BP’s strategy</a> as it reported a sharp slump in 2024 profits to $8.9bn, from $14bn the year before.</p> <p>This came only days after Elliott Management, a prominent activist investor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/13/activist-hedge-fund-reportedly-amasses-38bn-stake-in-bp">reportedly built up a sizeable stake</a> of about 5% of BP’s shares.</p> <p>The New York-based hedge fund is expected to use its influence as a leading shareholder to demand sweeping changes, including a boardroom cull and a potential breakup of the company.</p> <p>The company has already scaled back its target to reduce oil and gas output – set by Auchincloss’s predecessor Bernard Looney – by the end of the decade. In 2020, the last time it presented a comprehensive strategy update, it aimed for a 40% reduction, but changed this to a 25% reduction in 2023, and is expected to reduce it further on Wednesday.</p> <p>BP declined to comment on what it described as speculation in the run-up to the investor day. The event, originally planned to take place in New York on 11 February, was delayed and will be held in London because Auchincloss is recovering from a medical procedure.</p> <p>Other energy companies such as Shell have renewed their focus on oil and gas, chasing better returns after fossil fuel prices bounced back from pandemic lows, and after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago. The investor environment has also changed with the re-election of the US president, Donald Trump, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/10/trump-rallies-extreme-heat">a strong advocate of fossil fuels</a>.</p> <p>Since taking over, initially on an interim basis in September 2023, Auchincloss has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/07/bp-abandoning-plan-to-cut-oil-output-angers-green-groups">scaled back investments in renewables and diluted BP’s climate pledges</a>. He is also pushing through $2bn of cost cuts, which include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/16/bp-to-cut-4700-jobs-3000-contractor-roles-costs#:~:text=BP%20to%20cut%204%2C700%20jobs,1.6bn%20%7C%20BP%20%7C%20The%20Guardian">cutting thousands of jobs and scrapping contractors</a> to reduce the workforce by 5%.</p>
