<p>Plans to scrap the 2031 census in England and Wales are expected to be overturned after a backlash from senior statisticians over proposals to replace it with a patchwork of alternative data sources.</p> <p>The UK government <a href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/letterfromrthonfrancismaudemptosirandrewdilnot18071_tcm97-43946.pdf">said in 2014</a> that its “ambition” was to abolish the mandatory national survey after 2021 and instead rely on piecing together “administrative data” collected by other bodies and surveys. Apart from a wartime gap in 1941, a census has been conducted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/03/out-for-the-count-has-britain-already-conducted-its-last-census">every 10 years</a> in Britain since 1801.</p> <p>Those in favour of scrapping the census argue that the value of a once-a-decade snapshot is limited when so much real-time data is routinely collected by public sector bodies such as the NHS, HMRC or in school enrolment.</p> <p>“Based on our work to date … we can move beyond the decade-long cycle of population statistics that has dominated for centuries,” the then national statistician, Prof Ian Diamond, <a href="https://consultations.ons.gov.uk/ons/futureofpopulationandmigrationstatistics/supporting_documents/Future%20of%20Population%20and%20Migration%20Statistics%20Consultation%20Document.pdf">said in 2023</a>.</p> <p>However, the proposal concerned statistical bodies and senior statisticians, who queried the feasibility and cost of patching together datasets that may have been collected in widely different ways.</p> <p>The Royal Statistical Society, while <a href="https://rss.org.uk/RSS/media/File-library/Policy/RSS-response-to-ONS-population-consultation.pdf?ext=.pdf">broadly supportive</a> of the principle, said it had concerns over how reliably other bodies would share information and how comprehensive a piecemeal approach would be.</p> <p>In addition, 60 academics and leading statisticians published an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231110081349/https:/nms.kcl.ac.uk/john.armstrong/openletters/letter.php?campaign=future_of_population_statistics">open letter</a> warning that an “untested patchwork” of other sources “risks an increasingly fragmented and inaccurate data landscape”, describing the government’s plans as “wishful thinking”.</p> <p>The UK Statistics Authority (UKSA), the government body that oversees official data collection, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/news/news/planningforthenextcensusin2031#:~:text=Last%20updated:%2017%20June%202025,provide%20benefits%20to%20statistical%20users.">has now recommended</a> that the England and Wales census goes ahead in 2031 as planned.</p> <p>While acknowledging that the final decision rests with ministers, acting national statistician, Emma Rourke, said on Tuesday: “It has been clear from consultation and engagement that the decennial census, asked of the whole population, remains of enormous value for informing the most important decisions facing our country.”</p> <p>Alice Sullivan, professor of sociology at UCL’s social research institute, said: “I am absolutely delighted that the census has been saved. National census data is a foundational part of our data infrastructure, as it furnishes the benchmark against which we judge whether other data sources, such as surveys, are representative.</p> <p>“Without a trusted picture of the population, we would have moved closer to a post-truth world of untestable ‘alternative facts’.”</p> <p>Jane Frost, the CEO of the Market Research Society – the UK’s regulator and trade body for the sector – said researchers would “breathe a collective sigh of relief” at the UKSA’s recommendations.</p> <p>“Our £9bn market and social research sector in the UK has long relied on the survey’s rich, consistent and reliable data to provide businesses and policymakers with all-important insight on the British people, informing critical decisions across public and private sectors,” she said.</p> <p>Statistics bodies in <a href="https://statistics.gov.scot/home">Scotland</a> and <a href="https://www.nisra.gov.uk/">Northern Ireland</a> conduct their own censuses. The UKSA said the ONS was working with National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, “who are also advising their relevant ministers”.</p>
