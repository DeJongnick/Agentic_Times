<p>Stock markets slid further on Friday amid growing fears of an escalating trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, as China announced it would increase its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/11/macron-speaks-of-90-days-of-uncertainty-as-trump-tariffs-spark-further-losses">retaliatory tariffs on US goods</a> to 125%.</p> <p>The increase from 84% ups the ante to the same level as the US 125% “reciprocal” tariff on Beijing’s imports that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/10/us-china-trade-war-intensifies-as-beijings-tariffs-come-into-effect-after-trump-pause">came into force on Thursday</a>, although the White House clarified later that day that its total levies on Chinese goods were now at least 145%, when a separate 20% <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/apr/10/trump-tariffs-us-china-eu-trade-war-markets-latest-news-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67f7f1df8f0861692b423efd#block-67f7f1df8f0861692b423efd">fentanyl-related border tax</a> was included.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/11/trump-starmer-hopes-tariffs">Trump’s economic adviser dampens Starmer’s hopes of tariffs relief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indexes reversed the relief rallies that had followed Trump’s announcement on Wednesday of a 90-day pause on “reciprocal” tariffs on most other countries, reverting to a baseline of 10%.</p> <p>European markets had been gaining on Friday before Beijing’s latest tariff news but afterwards slid into the red. London’s FTSE 100 index slipped 0.4% on Friday morning, while in Paris the Cac 40 dropped by 1.3%. The German Dax slipped 1.1%, while the pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index fell by 0.9%.</p> <p>In Asia, stocks had already been falling before the announcement. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index ended the session down 3%, reversing the previous day’s 9% gain. Meanwhile, the South Korean Kospi index dropped 0.5%. However, Chinese share indices were resilient in the face of higher tariffs, with the Hang Seng rising by 1.1% and the Shanghai composite ticking up 0.5%.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/mwgcI/1/" data-alt="Markets trending down chart"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/mwgcI/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Announcing its latest retaliation, Beijing’s finance ministry said that if Washington insisted on continuing to infringe upon China’s interests in a substantive way, the country would resolutely take countermeasures and fight to the end.</p> <p>Xi Jinping has urged the EU to work with China to resist tariff “bullying”. The Chinese president told a meeting with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on Friday there were “no winners in a tariff war”.</p> <p>US stocks closed down on Thursday after another day of losses, which accelerated after it became clear the total China tariff was larger than widely believed. The S&amp;P 500 blue chip index dropped 3.5% and the technology-focused Nasdaq composite fell 4.3%.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/xKerQ/1/" data-alt="Dollar vs other currencies chart"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/xKerQ/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Despite the market turmoil, the Trump administration has held firm. One of the president’s top trade advisers, Peter Navarro, dismissed Thursday’s sell-off, telling CNBC: “It’s just normal retracement after a big day. It’s no big deal.”</p> <p>American government bonds have also been selling off heavily as investor confidence in the Trump administration wanes. The yield on the 30-year Treasury is now on track for its largest weekly rise since the 1980s, according to Deutsche Bank, currently at 4.84%. Meanwhile, the US dollar has also been weakening, falling 1% on Friday against a basket of currencies.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/2vN1F/1/" data-alt="Dollar reserve currency chart"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/2vN1F/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The former US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has said the tariff policies could cost the average American household $4,000 a year. She told CNN: “This is the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen an administration impose on a well-functioning economy.” Yellen added that Chinese tariffs could be especially damaging, and “no one knows where these policies are headed”.</p> <p>However, Trump has told US reporters that he thought trade deals with some countries were “very close” and expressed optimism that China would eventually be open to negotiation.</p>
