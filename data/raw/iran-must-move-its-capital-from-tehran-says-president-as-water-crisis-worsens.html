<p>Iran’s president has claimed Iran has no choice but to move its capital from Tehran to the south of the country due to the city’s over-expansion, the lack of adequate water supplies and the growing threat of subsidence.</p> <p>Masoud Pezeshkian said on Thursday that he had raised the proposal with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, last year. He admitted it had received a lot of criticism, but argued that the accumulating resource crises were so deep that Iran now had an obligation to shift the capital, and no choice but to do so.</p> <p>He made his remarks on a visit to Hormozgan province, which sits on the Persian Gulf opposite Dubai.</p> <p>“This region is located on the shores of the Persian Gulf and provides direct access to open waters and the development of trade and economic relations. If we have a different view of the capacities of this region, we can create a very prosperous and advanced region. It is not good enough to accept the current situation and not design a scientific, accurate and indigenous map for the future,” he said.</p> <p>“The problems the country is currently facing require us to direct the development path towards the Persian Gulf. Tehran, Karaj, and Qazvin are currently facing a water crisis, and this crisis cannot be easily solved.”</p> <p>Tehran has grown to a city of more than 10 million people, and consumes nearly a quarter of Iran’s water supplies.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/21/we-must-change-how-drought-and-overextraction-of-water-has-run-iran-dry">‘We must change’: how drought and overextraction of water has run Iran dry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Previous presidents have raised the issue of moving the capital, including Hassan Rouhani, who even went so far as to draw up a plan with options. </p> <p>Pezeshkian has long sounded the alarm about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/21/we-must-change-how-drought-and-overextraction-of-water-has-run-iran-dry">Iran’s worsening water crisis</a>. On Thursday he said: “Last year, the rainfall was 140mm, while the standard is 260mm; that means rainfall has fallen by about 50 to 60%. This year, the situation is just as critical.” Some recent estimates put the rainfall in 2025 at just below 100mm.</p> <p>He added: “The reduction in water behind the dams, the drying up of some wells, and the high costs of transporting water from other areas all indicate the need for a change in approach. If we want to transport water from this area to Tehran, the cost per cubic meter will be up to €4”.</p> <p>Tehran’s dams normally provided 70% of the capital’s water, with the remaining 30% provided by underground resources. However, low rainfall and increased evaporation have reduced the dams’ share and increased pressure on groundwater.</p> <p>The president said: “Development without considering the impact on resources and expenditures will result in nothing but destruction. If someone cannot establish this balance, their development is doomed to failure.</p> <p>“In some areas, the land is subsiding by up to 30cm per year. This is a disaster and shows that the water beneath our feet is running out.”</p>
