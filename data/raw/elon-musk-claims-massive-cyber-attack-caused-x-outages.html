<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> claimed on Monday afternoon that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter">X</a> was targeted in a “massive cyber-attack” that resulted in the intermittent service outages that had brought down his social network throughout the day. The platform, formerly known as Twitter, had been unresponsive for many users as posts failed to load.</p> <p>“We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources,” the platform’s CEO <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1899149509407473825">posted</a>. “Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.”</p> <p>Downdetector, a website that <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/">monitors outages</a> on various sites and platforms, showed thousands of reports of outages that initially spiked at about 5.45am before returning to normal for a few hours. A second surge in reported outages carried on throughout midday, with the majority of them occurring on the company’s mobile app.</p> <p>Tweets that failed to appear displayed a message that “something went wrong” and told users to try reloading.</p> <p>The richest man in the world did not provide any evidence for his claims. His post came in response to a cryptocurrency influencer who suggested the outage followed other opposition to Musk’s enterprises. Protests against the so-called “department of government efficiency” initiative Musk leads and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/colorado-tesla-dealership-vandalism-charge">vandalism against Tesla dealerships</a> had taken place throughout the previous week.</p> <p>Musk reiterated his claim of a cyber-attack during an interview on Fox Business later that day, suggesting that the perpetrators may have been from Ukraine.</p> <p>“We’re not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyber-attack to try and bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area,” Musk said.</p> <p>Musk has been heavily critical of the Ukrainian government as relations between it and the Trump administration have soured. Musk stated over the weekend that the country’s “entire front line” would collapse if he turned off his Starlink satellite communications provider and called the Democratic senator Mark Kelly a “traitor” after the lawmaker posted about a visit he made to the country.</p> <p>The SpaceX chief executive, who acquired Twitter for $44bn in 2022, has also claimed that previous platform outages were the result of cyber-attacks. When his livestreamed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/13/elon-musk-donald-trump-x-interview-delay">interview</a> with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> almost immediately crashed last year, Musk alleged that it was because of a “massive DDOS attack”. However, a source at the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219121/donald-trump-elon-musk-interview-x-twitter-crashes">later told the Verge</a> that there was no attack.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/10/making-of-elon-musk-childhood-apartheid-south-africa">The making of Elon Musk: how did his childhood in apartheid South Africa shape him?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The outages on X add to a variety of issues facing Musk’s businesses and initiatives in recent days. On Friday, one of Musk’s SpaceX rockets <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/spacex-starship-explodes-musk">exploded mid-flight</a> and rained down debris near the Bahamas. A series of nationwide “Tesla takedown” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/16/protesters-target-tesla-stores-in-us-over-elon-musks-cost-cutting">protests</a> have targeted his car company’s dealerships over the past week, Tesla owners are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/mar/02/tesla-owners-selling-musk">selling their vehicles</a>, and the company’s stock price declined on Monday to its lowest level in months.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump held <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/trump-cabinet-meeting-musk">an intense meeting</a> with Musk and his cabinet secretaries on Friday that resulted in Trump suggesting he would rein in Musk’s power over government staffers, whom the billionaire has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/elizabeth-warren-fired-workers-musk">fired en masse from multiple agencies</a>.</p>
