<p>Droughts have occurred throughout history, but in recent years meteorologists have discovered a new and distinct form of this old threat: flash droughts.</p> <p>Flash droughts <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/99/5/bams-d-17-0149.1.xml">came to prominence in the 2010s</a>, with Prof Jason Otkin of the University of Wisconsin <a href="https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/natrespapers/1235/">proposing a formal definition in 2018</a>: a period of less than three weeks in which the moisture level in the top 40 centimetres of soil drops severely enough to affect vegetation.</p> <p>Lack of rainfall or other precipitation is common to all droughts. Flash droughts are distinguished by rapid drying out of the ground by a combination of high temperatures, strong winds and low humidity. This is severe enough to make plants start to wilt – “vegetation stress” – and affect agriculture. Subsequent work has refined the statistical measurements, but the original definition stands.</p> <p>While flash droughts have a rapid onset, they are not necessarily over quickly. A flash drought may simply be the opener for a long and damaging dry spell. As well as the danger to agriculture, they bring an increased risk of wildfires and an abrupt reduction in the water available for human use.</p> <p>Having recognised flash droughts, <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/103/10/BAMS-D-21-0288.1.xml">new measures are needed to tackle them</a>. Better forecasting and flash drought warnings are important, but improved water management and efficient irrigation are also needed.</p>
