 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Keir Starmer has said that the Trump tariffs are the start of a “new era”, and not just “a short-term tactical exercise”. </strong>(See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/apr/03/keir-starmer-uk-trump-tariffs-response-labour-local-elections-uk-politics-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-67ee9bcc8f083b47fa85597a#block-67ee9bcc8f083b47fa85597a">3.52pm</a>.) He was speaking at Labour’s local elections campaign launch as <strong>Jonathan Reynolds</strong>, the business secretary, was in the Commons updating MPs on the government’s formal response to Trump’s plan. Reynolds said the government would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/uk-respond-us-tariffs-calm-heads-starmer-business-chiefs">consult on retaliatory tariffs</a>, and his department later published a 417-page list of US goods that could theoretically be subject to tariffs. (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/apr/03/keir-starmer-uk-trump-tariffs-response-labour-local-elections-uk-politics-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-67ee85b98f08c15000e82dc9#block-67ee85b98f08c15000e82dc9"> 2.15pm</a>.) But the consultation will take four weeks, and the government says retaliatory tariffs would only be a “last resort”. The government is still committed to agreeing a trade deal with the US and <strong>Reynolds</strong> said he hoped this would lead to all tariffs being removed. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/apr/03/keir-starmer-uk-trump-tariffs-response-labour-local-elections-uk-politics-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-67ee484e8f08188975c6464f#block-67ee484e8f08188975c6464f">10.09am</a>.) <strong>Starmer</strong> and <strong>Reynolds</strong> have played down concerns that this could involve the Online Safety Act being watered down, or big US tech companies having their liabilities under the digital services tax reduced, but they have not ruled out the proposed UK/US deal involving changes to these two policies.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Neil Kinnock</strong>, the former Labour leader and European commissioner, has spoken about how glad he is that social media was not around when he was active in frontline politics. In a long and wide-ranging interview with John McFall, Lord Speaker in the House of Lords, for his Lord Speaker’s Corner podcast, Kinnock said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted">

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Unite union wants the government to cut energy costs for manufacturers as a means of protecting jobs at risk from the Trump tariffs. In a statement, <strong>Sharon Graham</strong>, the Unite general secretary, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The government cannot allow a situation where yet again UK workers pay the price. It is likely that some employers will now use the issue of tariffs at the bargaining table, in an attempt to push down pay.</p> 
   <p>In an increasingly uncertain world the government has to step in and step up to protect UK workers and industry. This tariff announcement is a wake up call. Nothing should be taken off the table, we now need a package of measures to support UK manufacturing and jobs.</p> 
   <p>As a starter that must include reducing industrial energy costs, buying British and a total reform of ZEV [zero emission vehicle] mandates to protect not penalise UK car makers.</p>

  <p>Northern Ireland faces “uncertainty and instability” because of the Trump tariffs, the first minister <strong>Michelle O’Neill</strong> said today.</p> 
  <p>At a press conference at Stormont, she said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is no doubt that the US market is an important market for us all, particularly across this island and these islands.</p> 
   <p>What has been announced yesterday is concerning, it creates instability, it is very much a race to the bottom.</p> 
   <p>It doesn’t serve anybody’s interests and I think it creates a period of uncertainty and instability in terms of the economy here …</p> 
   <p>It is very important we continue to be engaged both at a government level, with the Irish government, with the British government, with the EU level.</p> 
   <p>But also with our local business community here who are anxious about what this means for them.</p> 
   <p>We want to have a scenario where our bottom line is the protection of jobs, the growth of the economy. It is about ensuring we provide that certainty where we can.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Businesses in Northern Ireland face even more difficulty than their counterparts in England, Wales and Scotland because, under the post-Brexit trading rules for Northern Ireland, if the EU imposes retaliatory tariffs on US imports, firms in Northern Ireland importing US goods will have to pay those tariffs.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Scottish Tory MSP quits party saying it has become 'Trumpesque in style and substance'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Libby Brooks is the Guardian’s Scotland correspondent.</em></p> 
  <p>The only out LGBT+ Scottish Tory MSP has quit the party which he accuses of being in a “grotesque dance” with Reform. </p> 
  <p>In an excoriating resignation letter to leader Russell Findlay, <strong>Jamie Greene</strong> said that the party was becoming “Trumpesque in both style and substance”.</p> 
  <p>Explaining that he had joined the party under David Cameron and Ruth Davidson, “the party that supported gay marriage, in which minority communities were welcome, which pledged commitment to a net-zero environment and which was a political ‘big tent and broad church’”, he warned that “we now run the very serious and immediate risk of becoming once again the party of social division and morality wars.”</p> 
  <p>Greene, a highly able politician and thoughtful chamber contributor, was widely considered a rising star in the party before he was axed from the frontbench by former leader Douglas Ross, apparently in retaliation for Greene’s (qualified) support for gender recognition reform. Last autumn, he was an early candidate in the race to replace Ross, but stepped back in order to support party veteran Murdo Fraser, who lost to Findlay.</p> 
  <p>Attacking Findlay’s “Reform-lite” agenda, Greene added: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Chasing the votes of Reform party supporters will never see the Scottish Conservatives in government. There simply aren’t enough fringe rightwing Scottish voters to achieve that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>While Greene’s discomfort with the party’s direction of travel is not news, his decision to quit altogether is a significant indication of just how concerned and alienated the tranche of the Scottish party attracted by Ruth Davidson’s inclusive approach now feel. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer says Trump tariffs are start of 'new era', and not just 'short-term tactical exercise'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Some commentators have assumed that President Trump is just using tariffs as a negotiating ploy. Given that he has announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico, only to cancel them very quickly, there is a theory that he is doing the same thing again, only on a global scale. Alternatively, there is a view that a prolonged, negative reaction – falling share prices, rising inflation, higher unemployment? – could lead him to change his mind quite soon.</p> 
  <p>During the Q&amp;A at the Labour local elections campaign launch earlier, <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> in effect rejected all these theories. He said that what Trump was doing was the start of “a new era”.</p> 
  <p>And he explicitly compared the challenge posed by Trump’s economic policies to the challenge posed by his security policies, which have led to European countries ramping up defence spending.</p> 
  <p>In response to a question from Sky’s Beth Rigby, Starmer said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There’s a really important moment here that we need to understand, because over the last few months we’ve been talking about a new era when it comes to defence and security, and recognising that we are in a changing world, going into a new era, and therefore we have to act and lead differently.</p> 
   <p>We’re at a similar point for trade and the economy. This is not just a short-term tactical exercise. It is the beginning of a new era.</p> 
   <p>We need to understand that, just as we’ve understood it for defence and security. We have to understand the changing world when it comes to trade and the economy.</p> 
   <p>And I’m very concerned that we get this argument out there because it means that we have to adapt in ways which go beyond the mere question of tariffs.</p> 
   <p>And that’s why I’ve instructed my team to go further and faster on what we need to do to put more resilience and more strength into our economy.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But Starmer did not really explore what the policy implications of this were. In his comments about strengthening the economy, he mostly spoke about things the government is already doing, such as planning reform. Some parties, like the Liberal Democrats, the Green party and Plaid Cymru agree with Starmer about the UK facing a new era, and argue that it is one that requires rejoining the EU single market or the customs union, but Starmer has shown no inclination that he agrees, and instead says the UK should not choose between the US and Europe.</p>

  <p>Plaid Cymru says the government should respond to the Trump tariffs by cutting trade barriers with the EU. Speaking in the Commons earlier, <strong>Liz Saville Roberts</strong>, the Plaid leader at Westminster, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Some commentators are fawning over a 10% tariff simply because our nearest neighbours have been hit worse.</p> 
   <p>Let’s get real here. The 25% tariff on steel and aluminium will hit Wales’s biggest export to the US – machinery and transport equipment.</p> 
   <p>And it’s a fact that the EU is Wales’s greatest trading partner with Welsh exports valued at £11.2bn.</p> 
   <p>In the face of an American president with an obsession with international economic revenge … it is economic common sense to accelerate scrapping trade barriers with Europe.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The government has launched its online consultation on potential retaliatory tariffs against the US. There are details about how to respond <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-for-input-on-potential-uk-measures-in-response-to-us-tariffs/how-to-input-on-potential-uk-tariff-measures-in-response-to-us-tariffs">here.</a></p> 
  <p>It includes <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67ee668c9eae202448299c5b/request-for-input-indicative-product-list.pdf">a 417-page list of US goods</a> that might be subject to tariffs. The government wants to know from businesses how they would be affected by particular tariffs. In <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-seeks-business-views-on-response-to-us-tariffs">its news release</a>, the <strong>Deparment for Business and Trade</strong> (DBT) says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>UK companies are being invited to give their views on what any future UK response should look like by providing feedback to questions asking them the average value of their US imports, the impact of any possible UK tariffs and how they would adjust to them. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The department says the fact that an item is on the 417-page list “does not mean that it will appear in any UK tariff response, should the UK choose to impose tariffs on US goods at all”.</p> 
  <p>It also says the government would not impose tariffs on “products in the wider public interest issues such as medical supplies and military equipment”.</p> 
  <p>The consultaton will run for four weeks. But the government is not promising a speedy decision when it closes, on Thursday 1 May. “Once the request for input closes, the government will reflect on the feedback and consider how best to respond,” the department says.</p> 
  <p>The department also says tariffs are a “last resort”. Ministers are still hoping to a negotiate a deal with the US on trade that would lead to the current tariffs imposed on the UK being reduced or eliminated.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor.</em></p> 
  <p><strong>John Swinney</strong>, Scotland’s first minister, has pledged to “stand shoulder to shoulder” with Scottish firms facing the 10% import tariffs proposed by President Trump.</p> 
  <p>He told MSPs during first minister’s questions he will meet Scotch Whisky Association officials in New York in coming days, when he takes part in the annual Tartan Week celebrations there, to discuss “the very significant issues” facing the sector.</p> 
  <p>Swinney was questioned by Russell Findlay, the Scottish Conservative leader, over the Scottish government’s “short sighted” decision to cancel an export strategy devoted to US trade last year.</p> 
  <p>The first minister sidestepped that specific point but insisted Scotland’s enterprise and export agencies were heavily engaged in promoting trade with the US, while Scottish ministers were closely cooperating with the UK government.</p> 
  <p>Scottish whisky producers sold nearly £1bn worth of produce in the US last year, roughly a fifth of the sector’s overall production, while Scottish salmon producers exported £225m last year to the US.</p> 
  <p>Swinney said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The imposition of tariffs isn’t good news. It will be damaging for economic activity in Scotland, the UK, but also across the world and there will also be negative implications for the people of the United States.</p> 
   <p>I can assure Mr Findlay that this government will leave no stone unturned to make sure it can take forward the concerns of industry and work with the UK government.</p>

  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> has accused Reform UK of “fawning over Putin” as the prime minster used Labour’s local elections launch to turn maximum fire on Nigel Farage’s party over foreign relations and the NHS.</p> 
  <p>In a sign of how Labour views Reform as potentially a greater threat than the Tories, Starmer devoted more time to hitting out at Reform than at the Conservatives.</p> 
  <p>Labour chose a Derbyshire county council area voted the worst in Britain for potholes as location for the launch, during which Starmer accused the Tory-controlled local authority of being responsible for potholes and anti social behaviour.</p> 
  <p>But Starmer spared most of his ammunition for Reform, listing the rightwing voting record of the party’s MPs on workers rights and its position on the NHS.</p> 
  <p>“They claim to be the party of patriotism. I’ll tell you this, there’s nothing patriotic about fawning over Putin,” he said, during a speech and a Q&amp;A with reporters where he used the phrase “fawning over Putin” three times.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Reynolds says government launching consultation with business on possible retaliatory tariffs against US</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Reynolds</strong> says he is now opening a consultation on possible retaliatory tariffs.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It remains our belief that the best route to economic stability for working people is a negotiated deal with the US that builds on our shared strengths. </p> 
   <p>However, we do reserve the right to take any action we deem necessary if a deal is not secured.</p> 
   <p>To enable the UK to have every option open to us in future, I am today launching a request for input on the implications for British businesses of possible retaliatory action. This is a formal step necessary for us to keep all options on the table.</p> 
   <p>We will seek the views of UK stakeholders over four weeks until 1 May 2025 on products that could potentially be included in any UK tariff response. </p> 
   <p>This exercise will also give businesses the chance to have their say and influence the design of any possible UK action.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Reynolds stresses that retaliatory tariffs are only an option, and that the government still wants an economic deal instead.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If we are in a position to agree an economic deal with the US that lifts the tariffs that have been placed on our industries, this request for input will be paused, and any measures flowing from that will be lifted. </p>

  <p>Reynolds says further information about the consultation will be on the gov.uk website later today.</p>

   <p> [A deal] would deepen our economic relationship on everything from defence, economic security, financial services, machinery, tech and regulation.</p> 
   <p>There are clear synergies between the US and UK markets, and this is reflected in the fair and balanced trading relationship that already exists between our two countries.</p>

  <p>The talks will continue.</p>

  <p><strong>Johnny Reynolds</strong>, the business secretary, has been suggesting in private to Labour MPs that the 10% tariffs imposed on the UK by Donald Trump is a relative success and is down to Britain’s courtship of the US president.</p> 
  <p>“Colleagues will be watching the news from the US tonight. Whilst it is positive the UK has received the best treatment, reflecting our engagement with the US so far, we still have work to do to secure a wider deal that delivers the best for UK business and industry,” Reynolds said in a message sent to Labour MPs.</p> 
  <p>The tone was somewhat different to the one taken by Reynolds on the morning broadcast rounds when he told the BBC’s Today programme that he was “disappointed” by Trump’s decision.</p> 
  <p>Reynolds was pulled up by the Today programme’s <strong>Nick Robinson</strong>, who pointed out that the 10% tariff was a standard tariff for the whole of the world, including the unpopulated Heard and McDonald Islands.</p> 
  <p>“You’re not claiming, are you, that this 10% tariff is a result of your negotiations, are you? You’re not saying we’re being treated better because we’ve been nicer to Donald Trump?” he asked.</p> 
  <p><strong>Reynolds</strong> said: “We have engaged on trade issues, that has been important.”</p> 
  <p>Briefing material was due to be sent out to members of Labour’s parliamentary party, he also told Labour MPs, adding “your support as ever is appreciated.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Liberal Democrats are urging the government to launch a ‘Buy British’ campaign (which will bring back memories of the 1970s to older readers). <strong>Daisy Cooper</strong>, the Lib Dem deputy leader and Treasury spokesperson, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>People across the country are deeply worried about what Trump’s trade war means for their living standards, and want to know what they can do to help. We need to bring the country together, and show collectively that we won’t take Trump’s tariffs lying down.</p> 
   <p>The Government should launch a campaign to encourage people to Buy British and support our high streets, as part of a national effort to back British businesses. That must be bolstered with a raft of serious measures to unleash the potential of our businesses including overhauling business rates, scrapping the jobs tax and fixing our trading relationship with the EU.</p> 
   <p>Ministers also need to rule out making concessions to Trump that would damage our local farmers, threaten the NHS or undermine the online safety of our children. We need to send Trump a clear message that Britain will not be bullied, by rallying round our businesses at home and working with our Commonwealth and European allies abroad.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> has been tweeting about President Trump’s tariffs this morning.</p> 
  <p>Rather optimistically, she is offering to help the government negotiate a trade deal with the US. She<a href="https://x.com/KemiBadenoch/status/1907727783716847738"> says</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Leaving the EU has left us in a stronger position on trade. We now have an independent trade policy but this only works if it is used properly by people who know what they’re doing.</p> 
   <p>The only party with any recent experience of negotiating deals is the Conservatives. We are here and ready to help in the national interest. It’s time for the Labour government to get a deep and meaningful trade deal with the US that removes these tariffs and delivers growth without compromising on standards. (2/2)</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This makes the Conservative party sound non-partisan, which is often superficially appealing in Westminster politics. But, of course, it is not a genuine offer, because Badenoch knows that <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> is more likely to take negotiating tips from Larry the Downing Street cat. He told us exactly what he thought about Badenoch’s skills in this areas at PMQs yesterday. Badenoch “was the trade secretary who failed to get a trade deal with the US,” he said.</p> 
  <p>But <strong>Badenoch</strong> also criticises the Trump tariffs quite directly. She <a href="https://x.com/KemiBadenoch/status/1907727780730573085">says</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If we fail to learn the lessons of history we will be doomed to repeat them.</p> 
   <p>President Trump’s tariffs will not make the US wealthier but they will make all of us poorer.</p> 
   <p>Ronald Reagan understood this because he lived through when it happened before</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This is interesting because at the weekend <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14551239/Tory-MPs-bemoan-Kemi-Badenochs-near-ban-criticising-Trump.html">a report</a> (which Badenoch denied) claimed she had told her shadow ministers not to criticise Trump. This comment suggests she is comfortable being negative about the president. The overnight CCHQ response to the tariffs announcement (issued by the shadow business secretary, Andrew Griffith, who is more of a Maga enthusiast – see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/apr/03/keir-starmer-uk-trump-tariffs-response-labour-local-elections-uk-politics-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-67ee46398f08188975c6463f#block-67ee46398f08188975c6463f">9.33am</a>), criticised Labour, but at no point suggested Trump was making a mistake.</p>

  <p>Andy Burrows, chief executive of the <strong>Molly Rose Foundation</strong>, said the charity had written to Jonathan Reynolds to warn of the “dire consequences” of reducing online safety duties on big tech platforms. Burrows said:</p>

  <p><strong>Jonathan Reynolds</strong>, the business secretary, has argued that people interpreting the Trump tariff announcements as some sort of Brexit bonus are missing the point.</p> 
  <p>The Conservative party, and some Tory papers, have claimed that the announcement vindicates Brexit, because the tariffs imposed on the UK are lower than the tariffs imposed on the EU.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Jonathan Reynolds</strong>, the business secretary, said this morning that he hopes the economic deal with the US that the government is negotiating will lead not just to a reduction in tariffs on the UK, but to their removal.</p> 
  <p>British and US negotiators are reportedly very close to finalising a deal, but it has yet to be signed off by President Trump.</p> 
  <p>In an interview on the Today programme, asked if he hoped the deal would lead to the tariffs being removed, or if he was just hoping for a deal that would compensate for the impact of the tariffs by providing other economic benefits to the UK, Reynolds replied</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>No, I want those tariffs removed. I want them removed in terms of the 10% that’s been announced. I want them removed on steel and aluminium. I don’t think there is an argument, a strong argument, for those being in place …</p> 
   <p>I want not only to remove what has been announced so far, but to strengthen that relationship. I want more UK businesses with stronger market access to all parts of the US. That’s the prize on offer.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked if there was a deal “ready to go”, Reynolds said that was “not an accurate reflection of where we’re at”. But <strong>Nick Robinson</strong>, the presenter, said Reynolds was smiling as he replied, implying there was more truth in the question than he wanted to admit.</p> 
  <p>In a separate interview on LBC, <strong>Reynolds</strong> said praised the “warmth” and “good faith” shown by his US counterparts negotiating the deal, and he said they were looking at “a really significant and interesting and relevant set of agreements”.</p> 
  <p>He also said he wanted to ultimately make the trade relationship with the US stronger.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What I am committed to – and what I genuinely believe we can deliver – is a position where not only are we not in a position where we’ve got to think about job losses or about the loss of exports, but we can strengthen that relationship. That is what we’re committed to doing.</p>

  <p><strong>Jonathan Reynolds</strong>, the business secretary, told BBC Breakfast this morning that the 10% tariff on UK exports to the US would not be additional to the 25% tariff already imposed on British (and all other) car exports to the US. “As we understand it, those tariffs are not additive,” he said.</p> 
  <p>But he accepted the tariffs were particularly difficult for the car industry.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The impact on the automotive sector of that particular tariff is one of our principal concerns.</p> 
   <p>People will know companies, great British brands, JLR, BMW, Aston Martin, have substantial exports to the US, and that’s a real issue.</p> 
   <p>Now, we need first of all to make sure we’ve got this negotiation to try and remove those tariffs. There’s no need for them, in my view.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>It has been claimed that 25,000 jobs in the British car industry <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2025-04-02/more-than-25000-uk-automotive-jobs-at-risk-ahead-of-trump-tariffs">are at risk from the Trump tariffs.</a></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Tories criticise government for failing to negotiate deal with Trump that might have averted tariffs</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The UK is not getting special treatment from Donald Trump, the Conservative party says.</p> 
  <p><strong>Chris Philp</strong>, the shadow home secretary, told LBC this morning that he did not accept the UK had “got off lightly”. He explained:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Dozens and dozens of countries have the same 10% tariffs on all goods and 25% on cars, just the same as us – from Costa Rica to Colombia, from Peru to Paraguay. So we’re not getting any special deal or special treatment.</p> 
   <p>These tariffs are based on essentially reciprocation of what America thinks they’re being charged by other countries.</p> 
   <p>This is really bad for our economy. It’s going to put jobs and growth at risk.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In a statement issued overnight, <strong>Andrew Griffith</strong>, the shadow business secretary, suggested the government was to blame because it did not negotiate a trade deal with President Trump. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is disappointing news which will worry working families across the country.</p> 
   <p>Labour failed to negotiate with President Trump’s team for too many months after the election, failed to keep our experienced top trade negotiator, and failed to get a deal to avoid the imposition of these tariffs by our closest trading partner. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Of course, the Conservatives did not negotiate a trade deal with the US when they were in office, as Keir Starmer reminded MPs at PMQs yesterday.</p> 
  <p>Griffith also argued that the announcement contained evidence of a Brexit bonus.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The silver lining is that Brexit – which Labour ministers voted against no less than 48 times – means that we face far lower tariffs than the EU: a Brexit dividend that will have protected thousands of British jobs and businesses.</p>

  <p>In his comments this morning Keir Starmer did not try to claim that having US tariffs at 10%, the lowest rate available, and half the 20% rate imposed on the EU, was a great achievement for the UK government. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, did not deploy that argument either when he was interviewed on the Today programme.</p> 
  <p>According to <strong>Andrew McDonald</strong> and <strong>Bethany Dawson</strong> in the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/feel-that-sweet-brexit-bonus/">London Playbook briefing </a>for Politico, there is a tiny bit more self-congratulation in government in private. They write:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>Chin up!</strong> Whitehall officials were still trying to work out the details and small print from the U.S. late last night, but those Playbook spoke to believed that things could have been much, much worse – at least for the U.K.</p> 
   <p><strong>Hence … </strong>the early efforts from No. 10 to push the narrative that Starmer’s efforts to charm the president paid off. “We don’t want any tariffs at all, but a lower levy than others vindicates our approach­,” a Downing Street source told Playbook (and large parts of the Lobby). “The difference between 10 and 20 per cent is thousands of jobs. We will keep negotiating, keep cool and keep calm. We want to negotiate a sustainable trade deal, and of course to get tariffs lowered … we will continue with that work.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But McDonald and Dawson also explain why ministers won’t be arguing in public that 10% is a negotiating triumph.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>Now that’s a line:</strong> “Even the Taliban got a better deal than Starmer,” an SNP official, of all people, griped to Playbook last night as it was revealed Afghanistan is also in the 10 percent club despite “charging” the U.S. more in tariffs than the U.K. … err, if you include “currency manipulation,” “compliance hurdles” and all the rest, according to Trump’s highly suspect sandwich board figures.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer says UK has ‘range of levers’ as he promises to respond to Trump tariffs with ‘cool and calm heads’</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning. Today we are getting the considered UK government response to the colossal announcement from President Trump last night about global tariffs that could reset the way the world economy works. Rather, we are getting the considered initial response. Keir Starmer has ruled out immediate retaliation, and he promises to keep a “cool head” as he decides how to respond “in the coming days and weeks’.</p> 
  <p>Here is <strong>Pippa Crerar’</strong>s overnight story about the Trump announcement.</p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> 
   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/trump-hits-uk-with-10-tariffs-as-he-ignites-global-trade-war">Trump hits UK with 10% tariffs as he ignites global trade war</a> </p> 
  </aside> 
  <p>This morning Starmer has issued a response <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-remarks-to-uk-business-leaders-in-downing-street-3-april-2025">in comments to business leaders in Downing Street</a>. Here are the main points.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Starmer said that the government would act with “cool and calm heads” as it decides how to respond to Trump’s tariffs “in the coming days and weeks”.</strong> He said:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I want to be crystal clear – we are prepared.</p> 
   <p>Indeed, one of the great strengths of this nation is our ability to keep a cool head.</p> 
   <p>I said that in my first speech as prime minister and that is how I govern.</p> 
   <p>That is how we have planned and that is exactly what is required today …</p> 
   <p>That is how we have acted – and how we will continue to act. With pragmatism. Cool and calm heads.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>He said there would be “an economic impact” from the tariffs on the UK. </strong>But he did not say how serious they would be.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>He insisted that has “a range of levers” available that it can use in response, and he said retaliatory tariffs were not “off the table”.</strong></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We move now to the next phase of our plan …</p> 
   <p>We have a range of levers at our disposal, and we will continue our work with businesses across the country to understand their assessment of these options.</p> 
   <p>As I say – our intention remains to secure a deal.</p> 
   <p>But nothing is off the table.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Ministers hope that an economic deal with the US could lead to tariffs being reduced or removed.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Starmer said he would not agree an economic deal with the US if he did not think it was good for the UK.</strong></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Negotiations on an economic prosperity deal, one that strengthens our existing trading relationship – they continue, and we will fight for the best deal for Britain.</p> 
   <p>Nonetheless, I do want to be clear I will only strike a deal if it is in the national interest and if it is the right thing to do for the security of working people.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Starmer said that he would be guided only by the UK national interest.</strong></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Last night, the President of the United States, acted for his country. That is his mandate.</p> 
   <p>Today, I will act in Britain’s interests, with mine …</p> 
   <p>Decisions we take in the coming days and weeks, will be guided only by our national interest. In the interest of our economy. In the interests of the businesses around this table.</p> 
   <p>In the interests of putting money in the pockets of working people. Nothing else will guide me. That is my focus.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>These passages seem to have been included to rebut claims that Starmer has been too accommodating to Trump. Starmer normally argues that the US and the UK are very close allies, implying their interests are aligned. This is a rare acknowdgement from Starmer that Trump’s actions have changed that.</p> 
  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> 
  <p><em>9.30am:</em> Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> 
  <p><em>11.30am:</em> Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner launch Labour’s local elections campaign at an event in the East Midlands.</p> 
  <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> 
  <p><em>Around 11.30am:</em> Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, makes a statement to MPs about the Trump tariffs.</p> 
  <p>I’m afraid that, for the next few weeks or months, on most days staff shortages mean that comments will only be open on the blog between 10am and 3pm.</p> 
  <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line, when comments are open, or message me on social media. I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word.</p> 
  <p>If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/13/the-guardian-no-longer-post-on-x-twitter-elon-musk">given up posting from its official accounts on X</a> but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary.</p> 
  <p>I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.</p>
