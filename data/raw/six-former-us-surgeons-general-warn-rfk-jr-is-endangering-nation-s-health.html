<p>Six former US surgeons general – the top medical posting in Washington – warned in an opinion column published on Tuesday that policy changes enacted by the health and human services (HHS) secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, are “endangering the health of the nation”.</p> <p>The surgeons general – Jerome Adams, Richard Carmona, Joycelyn Elders, Vivek Murthy, Antonia Novello and David Satcher – who served under both Republican and Democrat administrations, identified changes in vaccine policy, medical research funding, a shift in priorities from rationality to ideology, plunging morale, and changes to staffing as areas of concern.</p> <p>Referring to their oaths of office, both Hippocratic as physicians and as public servants, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/07/surgeons-general-rfk-jr-robert-kennedy/">the former officials wrote in the Washington Post</a> that they felt “compelled to speak with one voice to say that the actions of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are endangering the health of the nation”.</p> <p>“Never before have we issued a joint public warning like this. But the profound, immediate and unprecedented threat that Kennedy’s policies and positions pose to the nation’s health cannot be ignored,” they said, adding that they could not ignore the “profound, immediate and unprecedented threat” of his policies.</p> <p>Under a “Make America Healthy Again” (Maha) agenda, Kennedy has accelerated vaccine policy changes despite opposition from scientists, including narrowing eligibility for Covid-19 vaccine shots and dismissing members of a vaccine advisory panel.</p> <p>He has cut federal funding for mRNA vaccine research for respiratory illnesses and instituted a review of vaccine recommendations. Kennedy also sought the dismissal of Dr Susan Monarez, former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p>Monarez testified before Congress last month that her firing by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> came after refusing a request from Kennedy to dismiss CDC vaccine experts “without cause”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/wsj-kennedy-op-ed-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines.html">Kennedy said in June that </a>waning public trust in US healthcare and conflicts of interest between the medical establishment and the pharmaceutical industry are behind a mission to put “the restoration of public trust above any pro- or anti-vaccine agenda”.</p> <p>“The public must know that unbiased science guides the recommendations from our health agencies. This will ensure the American people receive the safest vaccines possible,” he said.</p> <p>The surgeons general pushed back on that characterization in their letter, noting that they had uniformly “watched with increasing alarm as the foundations of our nation’s public health system have been undermined.</p> <p>“Science and expertise have taken a back seat to ideology and misinformation. Morale has plummeted in our health agencies, and talent is fleeing at a time when we face rising threats – from resurgent infectious diseases to worsening chronic illnesses,” they said.</p> <p>They accused Kennedy of failing to ground public healthcare policy in science, pointing out that Kennedy “has spent decades advancing dangerous and discredited claims about vaccines” and referred to the recent measles outbreak in parts of the US.</p> <p>“Secretary Kennedy is entitled to his views,” the authors concluded. “But he is not entitled to put people’s health at risk. He has rejected science, misled the public and compromised the health of Americans.”</p> <p>Last week, two psychiatric organizations – the Southern California Psychiatric Society and a grassroots startup, the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health – <a href="https://www.protectpublicmentalhealth.org/press">called for Kennedy’s removal </a>as health secretary in a statement, arguing that the HHS had “been damaged in ways that directly endanger lives, degrade scientific integrity, and obstruct effective treatment for mental health and substance use disorders”.</p> <p>The groups pointed to Kennedy’s restructuring of the agency including changes to the substance abuse and mental health services administration (Samhsa), which the secretary plans to place under the control of a new entity, titled the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA).</p> <p>Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the federal health department, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/06/nx-s1-5424670/rfk-jr-samhsa-mental-health-addiction-overdose-trump-budget-cuts">said in a statement to NPR </a>that “Secretary Kennedy remains firmly committed to delivering on President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again by dismantling the failed status quo, restoring public trust in health institutions, and ensuring the transparency, accountability, and decision-making power the American people voted for.”</p>
