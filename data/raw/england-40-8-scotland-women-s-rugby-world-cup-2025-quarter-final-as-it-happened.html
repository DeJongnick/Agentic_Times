John Mitchell and his players know anything other than their name on the trophy is a failure, but need to slowly build up steam on the five-week journey to their required destination.</p> <p>So far, the Red Roses have stuck to their task well, save for a brief early wobble against Australia. They topped Group A with three wins and 208 points scored, setting up this derby date against Scotland. Huge underdogs in Bristol today, Scotland <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/zoe-aldcroft-returns-for-england-quarter-final-women-rugby-world-cup-clash-with-scotland">haven’t beaten their neighbours since 1999</a> – but Ireland’s efforts against France will give them hope.</p> <p>France have fought back from 13-0 down to lead 15-13, a reminder that nothing comes easy at a World Cup. If they can hold on, they’ll face today’s winners in the semi-finals. Just as in that game at Exeter, wet and windy weather could be a leveller at Ashton Gate. England’s expectations remain sky-high, but there is another job to do first.</p> </div>   </div>
