<p>An <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/national-mall-trump-epstein-statue">impromptu statue</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> holding hands was unceremoniously removed from the National Mall in Washington just a day after a group of anonymous artists erected it there.</p> 
<p>The piece showed the president and the late convicted sex offender, who were friends in the past, looking joyful together, with wide grins and feet kicked back.</p> 
<p>A plaque stated that it was built in honor of friendship month. “We celebrate the long-lasting bond between President Donald J Trump and his ‘closest friend’ Jeffrey Epstein,” the accompanying text stated.</p>

<p>The Secret Handshake, the group that created the art, had obtained a permit that allowed it to keep the statue displayed in the capital until 8pm on Sunday.</p> 
<p>But the National Park Service, the federal agency that oversees the area, removed the statue because “it was not compliant with the permit issued”, Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for Department of the Interior, said to CNN.</p> 
<p>Trump, who usually is adept at shaking free of any scandal, has not been able to temper the widespread curiosity and also anger from some on the right over the administration not disclosing the so-called Epstein files – all the material the authorities have on the business dealings, crimes and investigations into same regarding the New York financier, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-justice-department-fbi-review-confirms">killed himself</a> in jail while awaiting federal trial in 2019 on sex-trafficking offenses. His accomplice, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, is serving a long prison sentence.</p> 
<p>A Secret Handshake artist who identified himself as Patrick but would not provide his full name to the Guardian said in a telephone interview that the group built the Trump-Epstein statue to “honor the one and only true friend Donald Trump seems to have in his life”.</p> 
<p>In 2002, Trump told New York magazine that Epstein was a “terrific guy” and “a lot of fun to be with” but has repeatedly said in recent times that the two fell out long ago. The White House has called Epstein “a creep”.</p> 
<p>Epstein had also told the journalist Michael Wolff that he was Trump’s “closest friend for 10 years”.</p> 
<p>Trump recently said he was “not a fan” of Epstein and that he stopped talking to him because Epstein “stole people that worked for me”.</p> 
<p>Patrick said he was confused by the authorities’ decision to remove the statue.</p> 
<p>“The Trump administration has mostly been all about rebuilding statues that have already been torn down, of Confederate generals and other racist tropes and figures from the past” he said. “I would argue that Trump is a racist figure from the past, so why would you tear that down?”</p> 
<p>In a statement to the New York Times, the White House said: “Democrats, the media and the organization that’s wasting their money on this statue knew about Epstein and his victims for years and did nothing to help them while President Trump was calling for transparency, and is now delivering on it with thousands of pages of documents.”</p>
