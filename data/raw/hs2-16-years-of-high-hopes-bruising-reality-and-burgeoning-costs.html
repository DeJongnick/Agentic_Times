<p>Under detailed plans ministers set out more than a decade ago, HS2 was to cost £32.7bn and trains would be running by next year. Now that money has already been spent, the planned network has been cut back to one line, no track has been laid and no train has been built.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, announced that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/18/hs2-delayed-beyond-2033-high-speed-rail">the London to Birmingham line would be delayed</a> from the 2033 target, but did not set a new date. She called the project an “appalling mess” but vowed to “sort it out”.</p> <p>As Labour attempts to draw a line under a “litany of failure” and reset construction work on the high-speed line, here are the key moments in a story of high hopes and bruising reality.</p> <p><strong>2009</strong></p> <p>The Labour government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/14/high-speed-rail-london-kent">announces plans</a> for a high-speed railway running from London to northern England and sets up HS2 Ltd.</p> <p><strong>2010</strong></p> <p>The coalition government comes to power, backing greener transport, and reviews the scope of the line, including a possible spur to Heathrow.</p> <p><strong>January 2012</strong></p> <p>The transport secretary, Justine Greening, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/10/hs2-rail-project-green-light">gives the official ministerial green light</a>.
