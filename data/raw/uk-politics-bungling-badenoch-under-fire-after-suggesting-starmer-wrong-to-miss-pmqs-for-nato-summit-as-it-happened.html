 <h2 class="block-title">Poorer working age people expected to see their incomes fall in real terms by end of decade, Resolution Foundation says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Resolution Foundation</strong> thinktank has also published a major report today – its <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2025/06/LivingStandardsOutlook2025.pdf">living standards outlook 2025.</a> </p> 
  <p>It says, overall, working-age people will be just 1% better off by the end of the decade.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The headline outlook for living standards is, at best, disappointing. In our central scenario, the typical annual real income of non-pensioners grows over the five years after 2024-25 but only slightly (1 per cent overall growth, or a cash increase of around £300 in total) – and our outlook for 2025-26 specifically remains poor with income flat (0 per cent growth).</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But poorer working-age peope will be worse off, it says.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The outlook for the lower-income half of the non-pensioner population is even worse. In our central case, the average real incomes of this group would be 1 per cent (£200) lower in 2029-30 than in 2024-25. This compares to 1 per cent growth for the top half. The only projected year where the bottom half outperforms the top half is 2026-27, when the real value of basic benefit adequacy rises given lagged uprating plus the first of the planned above-inflation boosts. Coupled with net real income hits over the past five years, these projections would leave the bottom half worse off at the end of the 2020s than in 2019-20 (by 2 per cent) while the higher-income half would be slightly better off (by 1 per cent). </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welfare bill cuts could lead to 500,000 people losing out by more than £8,000, IFS says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Institute for Fiscal Studies</strong> has published <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/publications/governments-proposed-reforms-health-related-benefits-incomes-insurance-and-incentives">a new report</a> today on the proposals to cut sickness and disability benefits in the UC and Pip bill. Many thinktanks have already published reports on the impact of these measures, but this analysis contains some new material, and is a bit more long term than some of the other ones.</p> 
  <p>It contains findings that might be welcomed both by supporters of the bill, and its opponents.</p> 
  <p>Supporters of the bill argue that the current system is unsustainable, and the IFS says that eventually the measures could save £11bn a year.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The long-run legacy of these reforms is far greater. The reform package will still be being rolled out well into the 2030s. Based on 2029–30 claimant numbers, we expect the three main reforms could save £10bn per year when fully rolled out. Adding in the removal of UCHE [universal credit health element] for under-22s, the proposed additional premium for those with the most severe disabilities and the scrapping of the work capability assessment brings the savings to as much as £11bn per year, equivalent to 17% of pre-reform expected health-related working-age benefit expenditure in 2029–30. If the number of applicants for health-related benefits continues to grow past 2029–30, both spending on health-related benefits and the savings from these reforms could be even bigger than these figures.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But bigger-than-expected savings for the taxpayer means bigger-than-expected losses for claimants, and the IFS says in the long term this could lead to 500,000 people losing more than £8,000. That figure is a mix of existing claimants who will find their payments cut, and future claimants who will lose because they will receive less than they would have got under the old system. The IFS says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>These savings – and again, this is after the reforms are fully rolled out – come from 3.2 million claimants of health-related benefits losing an average of £4,000 per year and 5 million individuals, largely without an assessed disability, gaining £410 per year on average. For some, the losses will be much greater: perhaps as many as half a million will see their incomes fall by more than £8,000. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The IFS also says the changes involve a significant redistribution within the welfare system.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The way that this package of reforms is designed means that their full effect will not be felt for many years to come. But when that full effect is in place, the legacy of these policies is a huge change to the shape of benefits in the UK. Support for health conditions, which – unlike unemployment support – has gradually increased in real terms over recent decades (Waters, 2025), will fall significantly. Some people who would have received health-related support under the current system will not, and most people who continue to receive some will receive less. These reforms will go at least some way to slowing the rapid increase in spending on health-related benefits since the pandemic. And it is likely that that will increase employment – perhaps in the low six figures.</p> 
   <p>In contrast, the support for people without health conditions will be increased. The introduction of an unemployment insurance – a significant contributory benefit against the backdrop of our predominantly means-tested system – will represent a meaningful increase in the protection the system provides against job loss. This is bolstered by the increase in the UC standard allowance.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In her speech to the BCC <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> confirmed that a Consevative goverment would repeal parts of the employment rights bill. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I have said we will remove Labour’s red tape.</p> 
   <p>We will remove the ability to strike with zero warning, something businesses cannot prepare for.</p>

   <p>We will remove the new ‘Fair Work Agency’, another quango, that is designed to hound British businesses, even when no employee has raised a complaint.</p>

  <p><strong>John Major</strong>, the former Conservative prime minister, would probably be horrified to be described as a typical Guardian reader. But his politics have evolved a bit since he left office in 1997 and, judging by <strong>Peter Walker</strong>’s report, many Guardian readers would heartily agree with most, if not all, of what he had to say about the state of the world in a speech today.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Reeves says government will 'continue listening' to Labour rebels ahead of welfare bill vote on Tuesday</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Rachel Reeves</strong>, the chancellor, has given an interview to local media during a visit near Burton-on-Trent today. Speaking to ITV Central, she confirmed that the government is listening to the welfare bill rebels ahead of offering them concessions. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The system we inherited from the Conservatives is failing people and failing people badly. And there is a consensus across the Labour party that the system needs reform. But, of course, we’ve got to get this right. </p> 
   <p>So of course we’ve got to take people with us on this journey. </p> 
   <p>And over the next few days, we’ll continue listening ahead of the vote on Tuesday.</p> 
   <p>Everyone can see the system we’ve got today isn’t sustainable. It’s letting too many people down. And we’re determined as a Labour government based on our values to reform that system.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This is very similar to what Keir Starmer told MPs earlier.

  <p>Keir Starmer has also criticised Badenoch for what she said.

 <h2 class="block-title">Badenoch defends attacking Starmer for missing PMQs while at summits, saying PMQs could have been moved to Thursday</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Badenoch</strong> is now taking questions from the floor.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: [From GB News] Are you going to remove the whip from Mark Pritchard, the Conservative MP who criticised the tone of your question to Keir Starmer today?

  <p><strong>Badenoch</strong> starts by saying, sarcastically, that she is sure everyone in the room wants to hear the answer to that.</p> 
  <p>She says she won’t remove the whip from Pritchard.</p> 
  <p>She goes on to defend implying that Starmer was dodging PMQs when he attended the G7 and Nato summits. She suggests he should have moved PMQs to Thursday.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I love answering questions. The prime minister does not.</p> 
   <p>It is perfectly possible to move PMQs to Thursday. There’s no reason why it has to be on Wednesday. You used to be on Tuesdays and Thursdays. But he doesn’t want to have PMQs, and the reason why is because he doesn’t like answering questions. </p> 
   <p>Anybody who’s ever watched PMQs will see that he doesn’t answer anything. He didn’t answer any of the questions that I asked him in the statement that he had.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She says it is her job to hold the government to account. And she claims that “me cosying up to the prime minister when I think he’s made mistakes is not the way for us to win back public trust”.</p> 
  <p>She says the Tories had to “show that we’re on the side of the people out there, not just having a cosy parliamentary session”.</p>

At this stage William Hague was on -30, Ed Miliband on -10 and Keir Starmer himself just above zero.</p> 
   <p>‘The polls are absolutely horrific,’ says a shadow minister. ‘Kemi’s personal polling is in Liz Truss territory. There is now no precedent for it. People say “Let Kemi be Kemi” but there are increasingly few don’t-knows and they are moving against us. We are being frozen out of the national conversation.’ Dozens of MPs believe that if she is still in charge next spring there might be very little left.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Shipman also says that Boris Johnson is mulling over a return to frontline politics and has a five-point plan for his comeback.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Multiple sources say Johnson has thought about his offer to the party and the country. ‘There is a five-point plan,’ says a former minister. This would include a mea culpa for the ‘Boriswave’ which saw net migration soar past 900,000 a year. ‘He would blame Priti [Patel],’ his home secretary, a source says. But many younger MPs see immigration as a deal-breaker for Johnson, and believe that Jenrick, who resigned from Rishi Sunak’s government over it, is the more credible replacement leader.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Badenoch suggests Tories would curb disability benefit payments for mental health conditions like anxiety</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> has welcomed a thinktank report proposing that sickness benefits for people with behavioural and mental health conditions like anxiety should be drastically curtailed, with money invested instead in talking therapies.</p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/CSJ-Change_the_Prescription-Update.pdf">its report</a> the <strong>Centre for Social Justice</strong>, a centre-right thinktank originally set up by Iain Duncan Smith, says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Britain is facing a mental health and welfare crisis. Since the pandemic, spending on incapacity and disability benefits for working-age adults has surged by £20 billion, coinciding with a sharp increase in claims citing anxiety or depression. Meanwhile, outcomes have not improved, and thousands are missing out on all the financial, social and health benefits of work. The current system is failing both the taxpayer and those it is meant to support. </p> 
   <p>In this paper we propose a new course – one that moves away from passive welfare and towards active support. This update to the landmark Change the Prescription report builds on our earlier findings by calling on the government to target mental health benefits to those with the most severe conditions and reinvest savings to radically expand access to NHS Talking Therapies and community-based treatment. </p> 
   <p>CSJ modelling shows this approach would deliver savings of £7.4bn per year by 2029/30. We recommend £1bn of this be used to fund 1.5m additional Talking Therapies courses, a 44 per cent increase every year, empowering individuals with less severe conditions to both recover and return to work. In doing so, we can replace long-term dependency with genuine recovery and independence</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In her speech to the BCC conference this afternoon, <strong>Badenoch</strong> is expected to say:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Britain needs real welfare reform if we’re to incentivise takers to become makers. By 2030, one in every four pounds raised through income tax will be spent on health and disability benefits – alone more than the entire UK defence budget – and that’s excluding all the other benefits. In an increasingly dangerous world, that is simply unsustainable.</p> 
   <p>We need a fundamental rethink about which conditions should qualify for long-term financial support. I was shocked to hear that the majority of new disability claims in this country are now for behavioural and mental health conditions like anxiety.</p> 
   <p>Research published today by the Centre for Social Justice today shows that by narrowing eligibility — focusing support on those with more severe conditions — we could save up to £9 billion a year from the welfare bill.</p> 
   <p>That is a serious amount of money we could save. But I know it won’t be easy. Under my leadership, the Conservative party will not shy away from confronting the tough questions that need answering and, more importantly, providing the solutions.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In October last year Badenoch was strongly criticised after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/14/kemi-badenoch-autism-criticism-robert-jenrick-conservatives-leadership-labour-investment-uk-politics-live-updates?page=with%3Ablock-670cbfe78f08e1594c64c526#block-670cbfe78f08e1594c64c526">releasing a report</a> implying too much support is offered to people with conditions like autism.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Reform UK would be largest party in hung parliament, YouGov's first post-election MRP poll suggests</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Reform UK would be the largest party in the House of Commons, but without a majority, according to<a href="https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/52437-first-yougov-mrp-since-2024-election-shows-a-hung-parliament-with-reform-uk-as-largest-party"> a major poll</a> published by <strong>YouGov</strong> today.</p> 
  <p>It is the first MRP poll produced by YouGov since the election. MRP (multi-level regression and post-stratification) is a form of ultra-detailed polling that produces projections for every constituency. In the past MRP polls have often, but not always, proved more reliable than conventional polls, and YouGov claims its MRP poll was <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/51186-a-summary-of-yougovs-review-into-our-2024-general-election-performance">most accurate </a>in terms of seats in the 2024 general election.</p> 
  <p>Here is a YouGov chart with figures from the poll. Reform UK would have the most seats, followed by Labour, then the Lib Dems, with the Tories in fourth place. Neither the two main rightwing parties, nor the combined liberal/left/nationalist parties would have enough MPs to form a majority government.</p> 
  <p>And this is what the electoral map of Britain would look like if this result were to apply.</p> 
  <p>A result like this would lead to a hung parliament. In his write-up for YouGov, <strong>Patrick English</strong> says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Across all model simulations, Reform UK are the largest party in the parliament in around 99%, with the small remainder of simulations pointing toward Labour being largest. A hung parliament is also by far the most likely outcome, according to our data and models, if an election were on the cards right now, happening in around 97% of simulations.</p> 
   <p>According to our central projection, no realistic two-party government or coalition would reach the 326 seats required for a mathematical House of Commons majority. Combining the Reform and Conservative total figures leaves us at a total of 317 – the same number of seats which the Conservatives alone won under Theresa May back in 2017.</p> 
   <p>Back then, the Conservatives relied on a confidence and supply arrangement with the Democratic Unionist Party in order to govern. In our central projection, a Reform-Conservative coalition would need to do something similar.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But the DUP had 10 seats after the 2017 election. Now they only have five.</p> 
  <p>Keir Starmer does not have to call a general election for another four years and this poll may turn out to be useless as a guide to who will be in power in the next parliament. If MRP polls had been around before the Falklands War, they would have shown the SLP/Liberal Alliance on course to win the vast majority of seats in the Commons. In the event, just over a year later, the Alliance won only 23.</p> 
  <p>But that does not mean that the Reform UK bubble will inevitably deflate. Traditional party political allegiances have weakened and, with decent, reliable annual increases in living standards a distant memory for many voters, the electorate seems more volatile than at any time in recent political history. This outcome may look unlikely, but it is not inconceivable.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>During his Commons statement <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> said that Britain and its allies are discussing snapback sanctions on Iran, under the terms of the 2015 JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action).</p> 
  <p>He was responding to a question from the former Tory PM <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, who asked:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The Iranian regime has long presented a threat to the United Kingdom. As the prime minister and I have both experienced, our security services have foiled almost 20 Iranian-backed plots here at home.</p> 
   <p>The prospect of a regime like this having nuclear weapons is unacceptable, and so I welcome the US and Israeli action.

  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>On snapback – I thank him for raising this. That is a consideration that we are discussing with allies. I do think that it has to be part of the pressure that we apply.</p> 
   <p>Exactly when and how snapback is applied will obviously be a question of discussion, but he’s absolutely right to say that is the very discussion we should be having at the moment, and I thank him.</p>

  <p>This does not necessarily mean very much. A spokesperson will often say ‘we never comment on X’ simply as a means of closing down a line of inquiry. Starmer may or may not have concerns about McSweeney, but if he had lost confidence in him, the chief of staff would be out. And he’s not.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Richard Adams is the Guardian’s education editor</em>.</p> 
  <p>The number of children and young people with special needs requiring support through an education, health and care plan (EHCP) continues to increase rapidly, according to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/education-health-and-care-plans-england-2025">the latest figures released by the government</a> in England.<br><br>Nearly 100,000 new EHCPs - statutory documents that detail support agreed by councils, schools and families - were issued last year.

  <p>For EHCPs citing speech and language difficulties specifically, the year-on-year increase was 18%.<br><br>The increases will stoke fears that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jun/20/councils-millions-extra-send-costs-overhaul-delayed">local authority budgets will come under greater strains</a> despite the government’s announcement last week that councils will be able to keep the estimated £5bn debts off their balance sheets for another two years as it tries to find a solution.<br><br>Georgina Smerald, policy and research manager at <strong><a href="https://www.sense.org.uk/">Sense</a></strong>, the charity representing disabled people with complex needs, said:</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The dramatic 18% rise in children needing EHCPs for speech and language challenges shows the system is at breaking point.

  <p>Tim Oliver, chair of the <strong>County Councils Network</strong>, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Today’s new figures once again demonstrate a system in desperate need of reform.

   <p>The Conservatives made a complete mess of our welfare system, but the way to bring the benefits bill down is not through cutting support for disabled people and those who care for them. It is by tackling the crisis in our NHS and social care, to get millions of people off waiting lists and back to work.</p> 
   <p>Family carers do tremendous work in often the most challenging of circumstances, taking huge pressures off our health services and helping loved ones. Taking support away from our nation’s carers is the worst kind of false economy.</p>

   <p>Let’s be honest, nobody cares what this prime minister thinks, and why should they when he doesn’t even know what he thinks, and clearly, no one cares what he thinks, because he was not involved.

 <h2 class="block-title">Alexander brushes off criticism of Morgan McSweeney over welfare bill, saying he helped deliver 'historic' election victory</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Morgan McSweeney, the PM’s chief of staff, is being blamed by many Labour MPs for No 10 now being in the situation where, with less than a week to go before the vote on the welfare bill, the government does not yet have the votes to get it through.</p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fee4fe50-a4ba-47a7-8bb8-11ee892b0249">a long read</a> on McSweeney’s role in the crisis, written by <strong>Jim Pickard</strong>,<strong> George Parker </strong>and <strong>Anna Gross</strong>, the Financial Times quotes a “<strong>Labour veteran</strong>” saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Everyone is selling shares in Morgan. People are starting to put their heads above the parapet and say maybe he’s not the Messiah after all.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The article says McSweeney is accused of ignoring the views of the parliamentary party and being too obsessed with fighting Labour’s left. It says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Another MP said McSweeney’s role in the government seemed to be to “shield” Starmer from uncomfortable truths, including on his welfare reforms.</p> 
   <p>“Other people in Number 10 were saying he didn’t have the numbers for this and he wouldn’t get it through parliament. The chief whip has been warning them about this for months. But they had their fingers in their ears,” they said. “It’s extraordinarily arrogant and complacent.”</p> 
   <p>Others see in Number 10’s determinedness to press ahead with next week’s House of Commons vote on the welfare bill a sign of McSweeney’s desire to still confront Labour’s denuded leftwing. One MP from the 2024 election intake said it seemed as though McSweeney was “spoiling for a fight” with the left of the party over the welfare reforms, which was a “very stupid thing to do”.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>The Times</strong>’ <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/starmer-aide-faces-mounting-criticism-for-handling-of-welfare-reforms-nlx7fghqq">splash story</a> also quotes unnamed MPs criticising McSweeney. It says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Other MPs in last year’s intake conceded many of the rebels were united by their dislike of senior advisers in No 10. “What links everyone on that list is that they reject Morgan’s way of doing politics,” one said.</p> 
   <p>Ministers blamed McSweeney and [Rachel] Reeves for “shambolic” political management. “Rachel’s responsible for imposing an arbitrary cuts agenda on Liz’s welfare reform agenda,” one said. “Morgan is responsible for shambolic political management. He was warned that this would happen and ignored it. He has completely failed to do his job.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked about the criticism of McSweeney from unnamed Labour figures quoted in the press, <strong>Douglas Alexander,</strong> the trade minister, told broadcasters this morning that he was not interested in SW1 “gossip”. He said it was for the prime minister to choose his team in No 10. But he also said that McSweeney was part of a team that delivered Labour “an historic victory only last July, against expectations”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer says government launching trade strategy</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> says the government is today launching its trade strategy.</p> 
  <p>Here is our overnight story about it, by <strong>Kiran Stacey </strong>and <strong>Jasper Jolly</strong>.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>Here is the <strong>Department for Business and Trade</strong>’s<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-trade-strategy-to-protect-and-boost-british-business"> news release</a> about the strategy. And this is how DBT sums it up.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The strategy will make the UK the most connected nation in the world and secure billions worth of opportunities for businesses, helping deliver the economic growth needed to put money in people’s pockets, strengthen local economies, create jobs, and raise living standards.</p> 
   <p>It takes a more agile and targeted approach than the previous government’s, focusing on quicker, more practical deals that deliver faster benefits to UK businesses. It strengthens trade defences, expands export finance - especially for smaller firms - and aligns trade policy with national priorities like green growth and services. It’s a smarter, more responsive plan for a changing global economy.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><em>UPDATE:</em> <strong>Starmer</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What we want to do is push not just for traditional trade agreements, but also for smaller deals that we can make quicker, at pace – whether that’s a digital trade agreement with Brazil, Thailand or Kenya; clean energy co-operation with the Philippines and Mexico, professional qualification recognition all around the world.</p> 
   <p>But perhaps most importantly, in this uncertain and challenging world, we will also give ourselves new powers on trade defence. To make sure that if your businesses are threatened by practices like dumping, that we have the right powers to defend you.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer urges business to talk up opportunities, saying it's time to stop doing 'that British understatement thing'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> says the government has stablised the economy, and is now moving to a new phase, where it is focusing on investment.</p> 
  <p>He says he wants Britain to be the best place in the world for enterprise. He goes on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I do believe we’ve got to stop doing that British understatement thing – we do it all the time, including me – because, believe you me, this is a great moment to get on the phone to the world and say, ‘Take another look at Britain.’</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He recalls talking recently to the boss of Nvidia, who told him that Britain was in a “Goldilocks” position on AI.</p>

  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> starts by praising the contribution to the country made by business.</p> 
  <p>None of the investment made by the government would be possible “without your contribution”, he says. “And I say thank you.”</p> 
  <p>Starmer does not spell it out directly, but he seems to be referring, at least in part, to the fact that business are now paying a lot more to the government in tax as a result in the rise in employer national insurance.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trade minister Douglas Alexander says Labour’s welfare bill rebels ‘trying to do their job well’ as No 10 considers concessions</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning. Irresistible force meets immovable object and … it turns out that the object is movable after all. Until yesterday afternoon, in public at least, ministers were insisting that they were fully committed to the welfare cuts in the universal credit (UC) and personal independence payment (Pip) bill – even though it has no chance of passing in its current form because so many Labour MPs have signed a reasoned amendment to kill it.</p> 
  <p>But last night it emerged that ministers are now looking at major concessions in a bid to get it through. <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong>,<strong> Kiran Stacey</strong>,<strong> Aletha Adu </strong>and<strong> Pippa Crerar</strong> have the details here.</p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">

  </aside> 
  <p>This is how their story starts.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Number 10 is preparing to offer concessions to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> MPs amid a major rebellion over the government’s planned welfare cuts.<br><strong><br></strong>Downing Street is understood to be considering watering down changes to the eligibility for disability benefits which had been significantly tightened by the reforms in the bill.</p> 
   <p>More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/24/keir-starmer-says-government-will-stand-firm-on-disability-welfare-overhaul">120 MPs</a> are poised to rebel against the government next Tuesday and there remains division at the top of government over how to stem the growing anger.</p> 
   <p>Concessions under consideration include changes to the points needed for eligibility for personal independence payments (Pip), a benefit paid to those both in and out of work.</p> 
   <p>MPs also want to see changes made to other reforms affecting the health top-up for universal credit which applies to those who cannot work.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Archie Bland</strong> has more on this in his First Edition briefing.</p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> 
   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/thursday-briefing-labours-welfare-reform-bill-rebellion-takes-starmer-by-surprise">Thursday briefing: Keir Starmer is now ready to make concessions on his welfare reform bill. Will they be enough?</a> </p> 
  </aside> 
  <p>Bland says: “Up until now, Downing Street appears to have been divided on the right way forward, with one source saying: ‘There is a camp for pulling it, a camp for concession and a small but insane camp for ploughing on.’ Reeves is understood to be particularly opposed to pulling the vote.”</p> 
  <p>This morning <strong>Douglas Alexander</strong>, the trade minister, has been on the interview round. While he did not announce any concessions, his tone could not have been more different from ministers, including Keir Starmer, speaking on this topic over the past few days. He was complimentary about the rebels, describing them as acting in good faith and implying their concerns were reasonable. And he said the government was listening.</p> 
  <p>He told Sky News:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The first thing that strikes you when you read the reasoned amendment [to block the bill, now signed by 126 Labour MPs] is the degree of commonality on the principles. Everyone agrees welfare needs reform and that the system was broken. Everyone recognises you’re trying to take people off benefit and into work, because that’s better for them and also better for our fiscal position. And everyone recognises that we need to protect the most vulnerable.</p> 
   <p>Where there is, honestly, some disagreement at the moment, is on the issue of ‘how do you give implementation to those principles?’ … The effect of what’s happened with this reasoned amendment being tabled is that that’s brought forward the discussion of how to give implementation to those principles.</p> 
   <p>So given the high level of agreement on the principles, the discussions over the coming days will really be about the implementation of those principles.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Alexander also said the rebels were, in effect, only doing their jobs as Labour MPs.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s right to recognise these issues touch very deeply the Labour party’s sense of itself and the rights and responsibilities of members of parliament.</p> 
   <p>What I see is everyone trying to do their job well, ministers trying to be open with parliament as to the ambitions that we have, members of parliament being clear as to their responsibility to scrutinise this legislation and get it right.</p> 
   <p>And that’s the character of the conversation that’s taking place between ministers and members of parliament in the hours and days ahead.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> 
  <p><em>9.15am:</em> Keir Starmer gives a speech at the British Chambers of Commerce Global annual conference in London. <strong>Graeme Wearden</strong> is covering the BCC conference on his business live blog.</p>

I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word.</p> 
  <p>If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/13/the-guardian-no-longer-post-on-x-twitter-elon-musk">given up posting from its official accounts on X</a>, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary.</p> 
  <p>I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.</p>
