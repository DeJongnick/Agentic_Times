<p>Labour party staff are being balloted on whether to accept a pay freeze this year, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Unite and GMB members who work for the party have until Friday to vote on whether to accept the proposed pay freeze.</p> <p>Labour’s coffers have been depleted by the loss of Short money, the constitutional payment given to opposition parties, now that the party is in government. It received £7.5m in Short money in 2023, according to its accounts.</p> <p>Insiders accused senior staff of failing to plan adequately for the impact of the election result on the party’s finances.</p> <p>One Labour employee said: “A pay freeze is a kick in the teeth for all the hard work and sacrifice that delivered last year’s general election result. It raises serious questions about what the most senior staff – many of whom are no longer working for the party – were doing to prepare for something they knew was coming.”</p> <p>Another said: “No money for pay rises for us on the ground but more senior staff have been appointed on six-figure salaries in London in recent weeks. How many directors do they need down there?”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/17/starmer-ally-hollie-ridley-is-appointed-labour-general-secretary">Hollie Ridley, Labour’s general secretary</a>, held back tears at an all-staff meeting last week where the pay deal was discussed, according to the employees. A party source said she became emotional when expressing how much she valued staff and their efforts.</p> <p>Many former senior employees have moved to government roles in Downing Street and Whitehall departments, and are no longer on the party payroll. Ridley replaced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/david-evans-appointed-labours-new-general-secretary-after-winning-vote">David Evans</a>, who stood down as general secretary in September and will become a Labour peer in the House of Lords.</p> <p>Labour is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/10/union-anger-over-labour-governments-insulting-28-public-sector-pay-plan">braced for a similar standoff</a> with millions of public sector workers this year. Government departments have recommended a pay rise of 2.8% for teachers, NHS staff and senior civil servants. Unions have said this is too low, considering the increase in the cost of living, and have threatened strike action.</p> <p>Labour party staff received a 5% pay rise in 2023 and 10.5% in 2023, according to internal data.</p> <p>At the end of 2023, Labour employed 533 people, 494 of them full-time, according to its accounts published in September. In the run-up to the election, the number peaked at 681. Staff numbers at the end of 2024 have yet to be published.</p> <p>Labour raised more than £9.5m to fund its campaign effort for the general election in July.</p> <p>A party spokesperson said: “Hard-working Labour party staff were vital in turning the tide on 14 years of Conservative government and continue to play a huge role in supporting the Labour government as we deliver our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/03/britain-social-care-crisis-labour-plans-to-fix-it">Plan for Change</a>.
