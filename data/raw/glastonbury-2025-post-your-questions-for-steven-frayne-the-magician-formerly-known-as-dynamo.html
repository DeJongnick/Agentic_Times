<p>Steven Frayne is one of the UK’s best-loved entertainers who made magic cool again. You might know him better as Dynamo, a self-described working-class hero who wowed the world with his how’d-he-do-that tricks. He found international fame quicker than you can shuffle a pack of cards but in recent years, he’s put his alter ego to rest – literally – in search of a more authentic self. Frayne’s knack for inventive tricks remains intact – though we’re still waiting to hear whether he can magic Fleetwood Mac back together again for a secret set this year. He’ll be answering your questions live at Glastonbury’s Astrolabe theatre, from noon on Saturday 28 June, with the Guardian’s Zoe Williams.</p> <p>When he started performing on Richard and Judy’s TV show in the early 00s, Bradford-born Frayne captured the nation’s imagination with his unglitzy style. This was down-to-earth street magic – not a white glove in sight. His breakthrough came with TV series Dynamo: Magician Impossible, which ran for four seasons from 2011-2014, and turned millions into illusion-hungry fans. Stunts became Frayne’s signature move; memorable ones included that time he walked on water (across the Thames), or levitated above a skyscraper (London’s Shard). He became the first magician to headline London’s O2 Arena, toured the world and became the closest thing magic had to a rock star.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/17/glastonbury-2025-post-your-questions-for-drag-legend-bimini">Glastonbury 2025: post your questions for drag legend Bimini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pressure of living up to his alter ego, however, signalled a dark period in his life and, ultimately, a rebirth. Now his Dynamo days are behind him: in 2023, Frayne symbolically buried his magical moniker and became a prominent mental health advocate, speaking openly about his struggles with Crohn’s disease. Firmly in his next chapter, he’s just finished a 47-date residency under his real name in Soho, London, with an acclaimed show that weaves together closeup magic and autobiography. He continues to explore tricks and illusions that innovate, blending psychology, minimal props and audience involvement. Will he be able to find the poncho you lost in the Shangri-La? Give you the inside track on easy card tricks? Or perhaps you’ve always wondered how he managed not to fall on the Shard?</p> <p>Post your questions for Frayne below and we’ll pull the best out of the hat. If you’re at Glastonbury, come down to the Astrolabe at noon on Saturday, but if you’re not, we’ll also publish his answers online.</p>
