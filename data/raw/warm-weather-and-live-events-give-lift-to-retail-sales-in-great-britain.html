<p>Sunny summer weather and a packed schedule of events including Wimbledon, concerts by Oasis and Beyoncé, and international cricket and football sent shoppers flocking to retailers and supermarkets last month.</p> <p>Retail sales volumes in Great Britain rose by 0.9% in June, bouncing back from a sharp fall in May, although slightly below analyst consensus forecasts of a 1.2% month-on-month increase.</p> <p>Sales fell 2.8% in May, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/bulletins/retailsales/june2025">revised down</a> from a previous estimate of a 2.7% drop, the Office for National Statistics said.</p> <p>Fuel sales also soared in June as consumers took advantage of the fine weather to go on day trips and weekend breaks.</p> <p>England recorded its warmest June on record while the UK basked in the second warmest June since 1884, <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news-and-media/media-centre/weather-and-climate-news/2025/june-2025-provisional-statistics">according to the Met Office</a>.</p> <p>There was the biggest month-on-month increase in fuel sales, at 2.8%, followed by department stores at 2.1%, while food stores such as supermarkets enjoyed a 0.7% boost.</p> <p>Department stores and fashion retailers benefited from a summer clothing buying spree, supported by promotions and discounts, while supermarkets experienced strong sales volumes, particularly of drinks.</p> <p>Textile and footwear stores also benefited, with sales up 1% compared with May.</p> <p>“Retail was one of the winners from June’s heatwave,” said Jacqui Baker, the head of retail at RSM UK. “The hot weather helped to lift the mood among consumers, while early sales tempted shoppers to the high street.</p> <p>“Consumers purchased new outfits ahead of major sporting events in July including Wimbledon and summer headline concerts led by Beyoncé and Oasis. And garden parties were in full swing as households stocked up on barbecue food, boosting food sales.”</p> <p>Fans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/07/oasis-fans-fashion-reunion-tour-cardiff-liam-gallagher">splashed out</a> on merchandise as the much-anticipated Oasis reunion tour began, while a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/20/oasis-merch-stores-spinningfields-manchester-london-cardiff-edinburgh-birmingham-dublin">series of stores</a> dedicated to the band’s goods opened.</p> <p>Non-store retail sales – mainly online retailers, reported a 1.7% sales boost to the highest level since February 2022.</p> <p>However, the fine weather kept consumers away from household goods stores, such as furniture retailers, and other non-food retailers including secondhand shops and auction houses.</p> <p>Sales dropped 0.1% month on month across household goods stores, and 1.5% across other non-food stores.</p> <p>“Following a poor May, it was an improved month for retail sales with growth across all main sectors,” said Hannah Finselbach, a senior statistician at ONS.</p> <p>“The warm weather in June helped to brighten sales, with supermarket retailers reporting stronger trading and an increase in drink purchases. It was also a good month for fuel sales as consumers ventured out and about in the sunshine.”</p>
