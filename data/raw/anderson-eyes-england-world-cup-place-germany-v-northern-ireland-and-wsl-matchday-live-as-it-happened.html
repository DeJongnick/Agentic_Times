I think we could have scored more goals, and I think it was definitely a much improved performance from the last time. I’m happy overall.</p> <p>“You have to just get the ball and just have that fearless mentality. There’s 11 players in 30 metres of space, so the only way you’re really going to get to goals is if you outplay somebody, or if you get crosses in like Reece James did with the second goal.
