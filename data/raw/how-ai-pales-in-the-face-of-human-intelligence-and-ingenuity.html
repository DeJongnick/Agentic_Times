<p>Gary Marcus is right to point out – as many of us have for years – that just scaling up compute size is not going to solve the problems of generative artificial intelligence (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/10/billion-dollar-ai-puzzle-break-down">When billion-dollar AIs break down over puzzles a child can do, it’s time to rethink the hype, 10 June</a>). But he doesn’t address the real reason why a child of seven can solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle that broke the computers: we’re embodied animals and we live in the world.</p> <p>All living things are born to explore, and we do so with all our senses, from birth. That gives us a model of the world and everything in it. We can infer general truths from a few instances, which no computer can do.</p> <p>A simple example: to teach a large language model “cat”, you have to show it tens of thousands of individual images of cats – being the way they are, they may be up a tree, in a box, or hiding in a roll of carpet. And even then, if it comes upon a cat playing with a bath plug, it may fail to recognise it as a cat.</p> <p>A human child can be shown two or three cats, and from interacting with them, it will recognise any cat as a cat, for life.</p> <p>Apart from anything else, this embodied, evolved intelligence makes us incredibly energy-efficient compared with a computer. The computers that drive an autonomous car use anything upwards of a kilowatt of energy, while a human driver runs on twentysomething watts of renewable power – and we don’t need an extra bacon sandwich to remember a new route.</p> <p>At a time of climate emergency, the vast energy demands of this industry might perhaps lead us to recognise, and value, the extraordinary economy, versatility, plasticity, ingenuity and creativity of human intelligence – qualities that we all have simply by&nbsp;virtue&nbsp;of&nbsp;being alive.<br><strong>Sheila Hayman</strong><br><em>Advisory board member, Minderoo Centre for Technology &amp; Democracy, Cambridge University</em></p> <p>• It comes as no surprise to me that Apple researchers have found “fundamental limitations” in cutting-edge artificial intelligence models (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/09/apple-artificial-intelligence-ai-study-collapse">Advanced AI suffers ‘complete accuracy collapse’ in face of complex problems, study finds, 9 June</a>). AI in the form of large reasoning models or large language models (LLMs) are far from being able to “reason”. This&nbsp;can be simply tested by asking ChatGPT or similar: “If 9 plus 10 is 18 what is 18 less 10?” The response&nbsp;today was 8. Other times, I’ve found that it provided no&nbsp;definitive answer.</p> <p>This highlights that AI does not reason – currently, it is a combination of brute force and logic routines to essentially reduce the brute force approach. A term that should be given more publicity is ANI – artificial narrow intelligence, which describes systems like ChatGPT that are excellent at summarising pertinent information and rewording sentences, but are far from being able to reason.</p> <p>But note, the more times that&nbsp;LLMs are asked similar questions, the more likely it will provide a more reasonable response. Again, though, this is not reasoning, it is model training.<br><strong>Graham Taylor</strong><br><em>Mona Vale, New South Wales, Australia</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
