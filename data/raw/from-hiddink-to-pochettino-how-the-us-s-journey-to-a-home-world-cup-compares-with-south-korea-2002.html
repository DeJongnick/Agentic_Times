<h1>From Hiddink to Pochettino: How the US’s journey to a home World Cup compares with South Korea 2002</h1>

<p>If there has been some criticism of Mauricio Pochettino almost a year out from the 2026 World Cup, Guus Hiddink could have said the same – and more – in the summer of 2001, when he was on the receiving end of thrashings and a new, unflattering, nickname.</p> <p>A year and five days before South Korea started their campaign on home soil, the Dutchman was in charge as they lost 5-0 at home to France. The same scoreline happened again, a few weeks later, against the Czech Republic. A suddenly doubtful media dubbed the former Real Madrid boss ‘Oh Dae-yong,’ a Korean-sounding name that translates as ‘5-0’.</p> <p>The following summer at the 2002 World Cup, however, the Koreans were beating Portugal, Italy and Spain on the way to a semi-final exit against Germany. The coach was made an honorary citizen, every restaurant in Seoul claimed a past visit and universities were designing new modules about what to learn from his leadership.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/13/us-men-to-play-south-korea-japan-in-september-friendlies-with-world-cup-looming">US men to play South Korea, Japan in September friendlies with World Cup looming</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pochettino could do worse than try a crash course from the source and give Hiddink a call to chat about what he did during that period between the summers of 2001 and 2002. Indeed, Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio did more than that ahead of the 2018 World Cup, visiting the Netherlands to talk to the man himself to try to find an edge that would take <em>El Tri</em> past the second round. After all, ahead of the 2002 semi-final, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jun/24/worldcupfootball2002.sport2">the Guardian wrote</a>: “None of the other participating 31 teams have approached the competition with the same level of preparation, professionalism and common sense, which is a tribute to their coach Guus Hiddink.”</p> <p>The situations between the 2002 and 2026 co-hosts are, of course, a little different, but there are some notable similarities. Hiddink took over South Korea with 18 months to go until the big occasion; Pochettino will have been in charge just three months longer than that when the 2026 edition kicks off. Mildly encouraging performances at the Gold Cup is another thing they have in common. It is little remembered now but South Korea appeared at Concacaf’s bash in 2000 and 2002 in search of competitive games.</p> <p>Hiddink was not in charge for the first, when Korea failed to advance past an equal group stage thanks to a coin toss loss to Canada. In 2002, the Koreans just got a single point behind the perfect Americans but, this time, went through, then got past Mexico on penalties before losing to Costa Rica in the semi-final. There were encouraging signs – a clean sheet against Mexico and penalty heroics from goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae, who would go on to star in the following summer, but still plenty of questions about a lack of goals.</p>    <p>Yet for Hiddink it was not about results but progress. The Dutchman was open about wanting a team that was as fit and fresh, two words that came up often, as possible. To work harder than any other team was always the goal and he said with pride during the World Cup that this team was the fittest of any he had coached before, including his Netherlands side which, ironically, beat Korea 5-0 at the 1998 World Cup.</p> <p>It helped that Hiddink had massive control, partly due to his status and partly due to a fear of failure. The <em>Taeguk Warriors</em> had been to five World Cups and had never won a game, despite coming close, and were desperate to get out of the group stage. Having a co-host or two can also help. The presence of Japan was a huge incentive as Korea was competing with its former coloniser on and off the field. Perhaps President Trump’s attitudes towards Canada and Mexico can at least foster some competitive feelings among the co-hosts.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/usmnt-mexico-concacaf-gold-cup">The US national team lost regional superiority, but gained some World Cup hope</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pochettino will struggle, however, to forge the club atmosphere that Hiddink managed so well with South Korea. It is easier to do so when 16 out of the 23 in the final roster are based domestically in a country roughly the size of Indiana, and most of the rest are just a quick flight away in Japan. Hiddink broke up cliques that formed around the strict age hierarchy within the team, a bigger deal back then than now, with divisions these days more likely to be between those based at home and those in Europe.</p> <p>Hiddink always knew that the domestic-based talent were crucial. With the 2002 World Cup kicking off in late May, earlier than usual due to the rainy season, most of the best teams were full of players that came straight from their European campaigns. The K-League season, which usually starts in February or March, was delayed until July, meaning that the upon returning from the Gold Cup, the coach had his players as much as he wanted. The international calendar is going to limit Poch’s time with his entire roster but working as much as possible with what you have can make a difference.</p> <p>It should not be forgotten that Korea was also a technically excellent team but, there is no denying that, it was also fitter and fresher than perhaps any in World Cup history. By 4 June 2002, the team was a coiled spring, desperate to play in front of an army of red-clad fans desperate for them to do well and a country ready to create an unforgettable atmosphere. The 2-0 win over Poland was not just a first in Korea’s World Cup history, did not just fire the starting gun for an incredible summer but showed how a team had been built in a short space of time.</p>
