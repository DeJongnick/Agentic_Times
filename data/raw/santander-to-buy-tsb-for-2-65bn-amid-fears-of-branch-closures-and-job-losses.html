<p>The Spanish bank Santander is buying the British high street lender TSB for £2.65bn, raising fears of job cuts and branch closures across the combined group.</p> <p>The proposed deal, announced on Tuesday evening, is the result of a takeover tussle in Santander’s home base of Spain, with the lender Sabadell having decided to sell TSB as it faces an €11bn (£9.4bn) hostile approach from a rival, BBVA.</p> <p>The deal will still have to be approved by Sabadell’s shareholders, but could result in TSB changing hands in early 2026, the third major ownership shake-up for the lender in just over 12 years.</p> <p>Santander UK said the TSB deal would make it the third largest UK bank in terms of personal current account deposits, behind Lloyds and Natwest.</p> <p>If it goes ahead, the takeover would end months of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/20/santander-reviews-its-future-in-uk-sale-regulation">rumours over whether Santander would pull out of the UK</a>, sparked by reports that its Spanish bosses were frustrated by UK regulations and the fallout from the car loan commission scandal.</p> <p>Ana Botín, Banco Santander’s executive chair, said: “The acquisition of TSB represents a continuing strategic commitment to our customers in the UK, offering a compelling opportunity that is financially attractive to our shareholders and aligned with Santander’s long-term objectives.</p> <p>“It strengthens our franchise in a core market through the acquisition of a low-risk and complementary business that adds to our diversification.”</p> <p>However, it also raises fears for staff and customers of job cuts and branch closures as Santander integrates the bank into its existing UK operations. The tie-up could see the TSB brand disappear, ending its 215-year run on the UK high street. Santander has not yet decided whether to scrap the brand.</p> <p>TSB serves 5 million customers through its 175 branches and 5,000 staff. Santander UK has about 14 million customers and 350 branches across the UK, with 18,000 staff.</p> <p>The purchase marks the third major ownership shake-up for TSB in 12 years, having been hived off from Lloyds in 2013 as part of efforts to increase competition following its £20.3bn government bailout in 2008.</p> <p>TSB floated on the UK stock exchange in 2014 and was bought by Sabadell a year later, marking one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/20/lloyds-sells-50-of-tsb-to-spains-sabadell">biggest cross-border banking deals </a>since the financial crisis.</p> <p>It is not the first time Sabadell has tried to off-load TSB, having hired Goldman Sachs to review the prospects for a sale back in 2020, after the fallout of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/20/tsb-bank-fined-it-meltdown-fca">a major IT meltdown</a>.</p> <p>TSB has been working to repair its reputation since the botched launch of a new IT system in 2018, which locked out millions of customers from their bank accounts, some for weeks. It resulted in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/04/tsb-chief-executive-paul-pester-steps-down">the resignation </a>of its then chief executive, Paul Pester, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/04/tsb-chief-executive-paul-pester-steps-down">intense criticism</a> from regulators and MPs.</p> <p>Marc Armengol, the chief executive of TSB, said: “TSB is a truly special bank, run by a first-class team that deliver trusted service and support for customers, day in and day out.</p> <p>“Today’s announcement represents the next exciting chapter for this successful business, as part of Santander, a highly regarded banking group. I believe this will prove to be an excellent fit for our loyal customers.”</p>
