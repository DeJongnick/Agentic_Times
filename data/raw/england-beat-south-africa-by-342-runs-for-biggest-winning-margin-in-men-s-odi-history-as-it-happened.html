On a good wicket like that, no reason we can’t get 400-450 with seven opening batters in the side. Bethell is good against spin and left-arm spin which means they have to hold their main threat back. Rooty is phenomenal and Jos can take teams apart. Jof was bowling rockets! To have that in your side… it’s a frightening attack. We’re a team that want to keep moving forward, what’s happened in the past is behind us now.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Temba Bavuma</strong>: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The calf is sore now, I’ll know properly when I get back home. It was a poor showing for us, things went terribly wrong, we’ll have a debrief. After how we finished off in Australia, this is what we wanted to avoid. We dropped chances that were below our standard, a display like that doesn’t do us justice. </p> <p>Chasing 400-plus, there’s no real formula. They put us under pressure, led by Archer, and we were a batter down. We didn’t have any answers to everything they threw at us. There are lots of positives to take from the series - coming to England with a fairly inexperienced side, we wouldn’t want today’s performance to diminish that. There are shining moments so we’ll try to highlight those. They can’t be wiped away by one performance.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bdb7098f087e152e2804fa" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-07T16:48:10.541Z">5.48pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Jofra Archer is named player of the match for his mesmerising spell of fast bowling.</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Before I bowled a ball I thought it would be difficult... I didn’t do anything different, I tried to hit the pitch hard. I do what I do for the team, got to get up and do it, even if you have a bad day. It feels good, didn’t think I’d have played this one, but to play three games in a row means a lot.”</p> </blockquote> <p> <strong>Keshav Maharaj is named player of the series</strong>: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>All the hard work is coming to fruition. Grateful to contribute to winning performances. The three venues posed three different conditions, tried to vary pace and angles on the crease. Kudos to England batters. We have good skills and pace, we have areas to improve. Back to drawing board but lots of positives, beating England 2-1 in own conditions. Want to start next series well.

There was some wind going across the ground so myself and Beth (Jacob Bethell) made sure one of us was making the most of that. Once you get 100 partnerships together, it’s hard to slow the game down when you’re not taking wickets and we took advantage of that really well.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>On his partnership with Bethell: </strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There wasn’t much helping going on! He knew exactly what he was doing. He is wise beyond his years. He is very clear on how he wants to play his cricket and he’s got wonderful options of where he wants to take the bowlers down and against different bowling types.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’m so pleased for him, I’ve known him for a long time now so to play an innings like that was fantastic. Hopefully he will go from strength to strength, keep entertaining and keep playing match-winning knocks for England like that in the future.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Articulate and humble as ever, Root then spoke about where he and the team are at in white ball cricket: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>More than anything, as soon as you start feeling content with where you’re at, you will get caught out. Everyone will catch up with you so it’s important to keep looking to get better, to keep improving and adding to your game. The more you play, the more information there is on you and the opposition can use that against you. So you’ve got to keep looking to get better but also using that experience.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’ll keep working on little things, tinkering here and there. It’s been fun and I think today is a glimpse of what this team is capable of in this format. The more we play together, the more games we get under our belt then we will get more comfortable and we will see more results like today.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bdb4398f08638a14b79357" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-07T16:37:36.650Z">5.37pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>A topsy turvy series comes to a close after three matches,</strong> South Africa will lick their significant wounds by lifting the series trophy after a 2-1 win, their first in England since 1998. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bdb2198f085f50533e9732" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-07T16:30:02.285Z">5.30pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">SOUTH AFRICA 72 ALL OUT - ENGLAND WIN BY 342 runs!</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>It really doesn’t get more emphatic than that, South Africa capitulate to 72 all out as Bosch reverse laps Rashid straight to Brydon Carse at backward point.
