<p>Military leaders and commanders at the Pentagon were ordered on Friday to go through their libraries and review all books that were related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">US military</a>’s latest anti-DEI move.</p> <p>Leaders were ordered to “promptly identify” materials that promote “divisive concepts and gender ideology [that] are incompatible with the department’s core mission”, according to a memo sent to leaders that was seen by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-hegseth-dei-library-books-770364ab99591402ddffe8758432ff26">Associated Press</a>. The department gave leaders until 21 May to remove the books.</p> <p>Also on Friday, the Pentagon sent a separate memo to the military’s training academies that the institutions should have “no consideration of race, ethnicity or sex” in their admission process and should focus “exclusively on merit”, though they can allow for students who show “unique athletic talent”, according to the AP. The department ordered the administrations to certify these standards by mid-June.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/trump-administration-news-updates-transgender-military">Trump news at a glance: military to immediately remove trans troops and use medical records to oust more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The memo to leaders on books follows a similar order that was given to the military academies, including the US Naval Academy, that led to the removal of nearly 400 books from its library. Books that were withdrawn from the library <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Apr/04/2003683009/-1/-1/0/250404-LIST%20OF%20REMOVED%20BOOKS%20FROM%20NIMITZ%20LIBRARY.PDF">included</a> Maya Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, novels by writers of color including the Palestinian American Etaf Rum, and academic books that examine race and gender.</p> <p>The department <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4180537/statement-by-chief-pentagon-spokesman-and-senior-advisor-sean-parnell-on-review/">said</a> that a temporary “academic libraries committee” would convene to help the other colleges and academies remove similar books from their collections. Librarians and staff were ordered to use search terms like “affirmative action”, “anti-racism”, “critical race theory” and “white privilege” when determining which books could be subject for removal.</p> <p>The book bans also affect K-12 school libraries that are on military bases around the world. A <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/defense-department-schools-book-bans-transgender-black-history_n_681b955be4b0a7eb6001ebf0">list</a> of banned children’s books, including books about LGBTQ+ teens and others dealing with race, has been issued by the Department of Defense Education Activity, or DoDEA, which oversees the schools attended by the children of military families abroad.</p> <p>On the list is a New York Times bestseller chronicling the true story of a teenager set on fire by a fellow teenager while riding an Oakland, California, bus, as HuffPost reported. The list also includes a collection of poems and short stories by a New York Times bestselling author documenting the feelings and experiences of teenagers in love.</p> <p>The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has vowed to purge DEI from the Pentagon, saying when he took office earlier this year that “our diversity is our strength” is “the single dumbest phrase in military history”.</p> <p>Since January, the Trump administration has been overseeing a widespread culling of anything the White House considers to be DEI within the federal government. The specific number of DEI roles that have been removed is unclear as the federal government isn’t keeping track or reporting which roles have been eliminated, but <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5348922/trump-dei-federal-employees-firing">estimates</a> say hundreds or possibly thousands of employees have been fired since the start of the year.</p>
