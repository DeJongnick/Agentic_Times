<p>Enrichment activities are often seen as the poorer cousin to core academic subjects – but we know that they can have a powerful influence on a young person’s life and opportunities (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/16/ireland-school-secret-transition-year-off-curriculum">Ireland’s big school secret: how a year off‑curriculum changes teenage lives, 16 October</a>).</p> <p>Enrichment and non-formal learning activities support a young person’s social and personal development and skills for life, and work in ways that textbooks and traditional lessons can’t. These are the skills that employers tell us they really value and, when available, these are the activities that often engage young people the most.</p> <p>Ireland’s transition year shows us that there is scope to think outside the box on enrichment – and significant benefits to doing so. At The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, we see the impact that access to quality enrichment has on young people, helping to build confidence and independence, support wellbeing and inspire future career pathways. </p> <p>As the government embarks on its independent curriculum review and develops the new Ofsted school report card, it is essential that it uses this as an opportunity to consider how enrichment can play a more central part in education and ensure equity of access for all.<br><strong>Ruth Marvel</strong><br><em>CEO, </em><em>The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
