<h2>Bibaa &amp; Nicole: Murder in the Park <br>9pm, Sky Documentaries</h2> <p>As the nation enjoyed the eased lockdown in June 2020, Bibaa Henry celebrated her birthday with friends and family in Fryent Park, London. But by the next day, nobody could get in touch with Bibaa and her sister Nicole “Nikki” Smallman. After 36 hours, and continual mistakes by the police, Nikki’s boyfriend found the sisters dead in the park. Police failures didn’t stop there – horrifically, officers at the crime scene took photos of the bodies and shared them. In this powerful three-part documentary, the siblings are remembered and their mother Mina Smallman explains what happened as the murder investigation launched – alongside her campaign against police misconduct<em>. Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2><strong>Unforgotten: The Bradford City Fire</strong></h2> <h2><strong>9pm, BBC Two </strong></h2> <p>11 May 1985 started as a day of celebration: football team Bradford City had been promoted and were playing the final game of the season at their home ground Valley Parade. But a fire blazed through one of the stands and killed 56 people. The disaster – which propelled vital change in safety regulations – is rarely talked about. This shattering film on the 40th anniversary of the fire rectifies that, with survivors, family members of victims, players and former ground staff recounting the events of the tragedy but also giving a wonderful ode to the football community and the people of Bradford. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>Bafta Television Awards 2025</strong></h2> <h2><strong>7pm, BBC One </strong></h2> <p>Baby Reindeer and Mr Bates vs the Post Office lead this year’s TV Bafta nominations with four, followed by three for Slow Horses, Rivals, Mr Loverman and Say Nothing. Brilliant shows such as Alma’s Not Normal and Wolf Hall are up for awards, too. The winners will be announced at the Royal Festival Hall in London, where Alan Cumming hosts. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>Elaine Paige: 60 Years on Stage</strong></h2> <h2><strong>7.50pm, BBC Four </strong></h2> <p>That was then, this is meow: an evening celebrating the first lady of UK musical theatre sees the star of Cats, Evita, Chess and many more reflecting on her remarkable career with Zoe Ball. Other highlights include a rare screening of time-travelling 1983 musical A Night on the Town and Paige’s 2014 concert film I’m Still Here. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2><strong>I Kissed a Boy</strong></h2> <h2><strong>9pm, BBC Three </strong></h2> <p>Back to the villa for the first ever UK dating show to feature exclusively gay men – with the twist being that once matched, they kiss to check their physical chemistry, then deal with everything else later. Episode one revolves round the Big Gay Gala, where host Dannii Minogue is already offering temptation beyond the allotted pairings. <em>Jack Seale</em> </p> <h2><strong>The Assembly</strong></h2> <h2><strong>10pm, ITV1</strong></h2> <p>It’s the turn of former footballer and Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker to face Britain’s fiercest – and funniest – interviewers. He looks nervous, as well he might, but after getting the basics out of the way (“You play football? And you shit yourself?”), the conversation veers into more tender and unexpected territory. <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Johnny Guitar (Nicholas Ray, 1954), 12pm, Great! Action </strong></p>    <p>Nicholas Ray’s western is one of the great misnamed films. Sterling Hayden’s titular gunslinger does kick the plot off, but it’s his old flame, saloon owner Vienna (a fierce, forceful Joan Crawford), who is the drama’s blazing heart. With a railroad being built nearby, she faces opposition from townsfolk who fear change – and blame her for it, not least Mercedes McCambridge’s Emma. But in this classic of queer coding, does Emma’s wrath hide a secret desire for Vienna? Check out Crawford’s costume changes for a sign of who wears the trousers round here. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <p><strong>Rodeo (Lola Quivoron, 2022), 1am, Channel 4<br></strong>The subculture of urban dirt-bike riding in France is a fruitful milieu for Lola Quivoron’s involving drama. Julie Ledru plays Julia, a motocross devotee who edges her way into an all-male group of riders through her skill at stealing bikes. Her tentative friendship with the imprisoned gang leader’s neglected wife and son gives this outsider a sense of belonging, but her independent attitude – and gender – cause hostility from some of the guys. Ledru, continuously on screen, is compelling as a woman who knows she’ll only get what she wants in life by taking it. <em>SW</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>IPL Cricket: Punjab Kings v Mumbai Indians, 10.50am, Sky Sports Cricket </strong>Delhi v Gujarat follows at 3pm. </p> <p><strong>Premier League Football: Newcastle v Chelsea, 11am, TNT Sports 1 </strong>Liverpool v Arsenal is at 4.15pm on Sky Sports Main Event. </p> <p><strong>Premiership Rugby Union: Exeter v Northampton, 2.30pm, TNT Sports 1 </strong>From Sandy Park. </p>
