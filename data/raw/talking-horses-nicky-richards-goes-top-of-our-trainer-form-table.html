Mr Richards had been having a thin time of it but three hurdles wins in the past 10 days, from just a handful of runners, have sent him to the top of our table. By contrast, Harry Fry, who had been soaring, has dropped a long way, Overtown Express having been his only success in the past fortnight, admittedly from just 13 runners; he will surely be back among the winners soon. The Henderson, Tizzard and Skelton camps continue in fine form, while Donald McCain is having his best run for years. But the powerful yards of Hobbs and Mulholland seem disappointingly quiet. Venetia Williams has not yet hit her stride, despite a couple of false dawns, but January is often a fruitful time for her. </p> <p>Today’s tips have been provided by John O’Hara, whose nap has, alas, become a non-runner. In that one’s absence, <strong>Archie Stevens (3.30)</strong> could be the pick of the Southwell card at odds of 7-2. He carries a penalty for his course and distance success last week, which still leaves him a stone below the mark he had at the start of the year. </p> <p>Jump racing fans must make do with Fontwell, where <strong>Roksana (1.45)</strong> is backable at 7-4. Dan Skelton’s mare gives weight away to all rivals but was quite a taking winner at Plumpton last month and could have a fitness advantage over The Vocalist, making her hurdles debut for Nicky Henderson after landing a bumper for Stuart Crawford in April. </p> <h2>Tips for all Monday races by John O’Hara </h2> <p><strong>Fontwell <br>12.45</strong> Comrade Conrad <strong>1.15 </strong>Goosen Maverick <strong>1.45</strong> Roksana (nb) <strong>2.15</strong> Get On The Yager <strong>2.45</strong> Born Legend <strong>3.15</strong> Stoical Patient <strong>3.40 </strong>Llantara <br></p> <p><strong>Southwell <br>12.30</strong> Dorian Gray <strong>1.00</strong> Bernie’s Boy <strong>1.30 </strong>On The Warpath <strong>2.00</strong> Alternate Route <strong>2.30</strong> Monteverdi <strong>3.00</strong> Dellaguista (nap) <strong>3.30</strong> Archie Stevens <br></p>
