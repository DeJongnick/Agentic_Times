<p>Viktor Gyökeres faces disciplinary action from Sporting after he missed his deadline to report for pre-season training. The striker, who wants a move to Arsenal, had been asked to join the rest of the squad by 5pm local time on Saturday.</p> 
<p>Gyökeres’s absence was not entirely unexpected, the Sweden international having informed the club of his intention not to return for the new campaign. There is a faint hope at Sporting that a deal with Arsenal could be finalised this weekend.</p> 
<p>Sporting intend to fine Gyökeres unless he can present a legitimate justification for his absence, such as medical grounds, extended leave authorised by the board or an urgent family matter. The squad left for a training camp in the Algarve without him.</p>

<p>The Portuguese champions, for whom Gyökeres scored 54 times in 52 games last season, have no pressing need to sell. That is the primary reason why their president, Frederico Varandas, has taken such <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/sporting-holding-out-70m-arsenal-close-in-on-gyokeres">a firm stance in negotiations</a> with Arsenal. He has said he wants €70m (£60.2m) plus €10m in add-ons after rejecting €65m plus €15m.</p> 
<p>“We are calm,” Varandas said on Saturday evening. “Everything can be resolved with the close of the transfer window, a heavy fine and an apology to the group.” With reference to Arsenal he said: “If they don’t want to pay Viktor’s fair market value we are very comfortable with that for the next three years.”</p> 
<p>Sporting are in a position of financial stability and sustained on-pitch success, unlike for much of the past two decades. They have won three of the past five Primeira Liga titles, after a 19-year drought, and benefit from the regular revenue stream of Champions League qualification. With the budget for the coming season secured, the club are under no obligation to cash in on key assets. Gyökeres has been central to Sporting’s resurgence, scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances, and has three years left on his contract.</p> 
<p>“If the geniuses who are outlining this strategy think this puts pressure on me to ease the player’s exit, not only are they completely wrong but they’re also making the players’s exit conditions even more complicated,” Varandas said. “No one is above the club’s interests.”</p> 
<p>Noni Madueke is close to finalising <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/10/arsenal-line-up-52m-transfer-of-23-year-old-chelsea-winger-noni-madueke">his £52m move from Chelsea</a> to Arsenal after being granted permission to return to London from the Club World Cup as Chelsea prepare to face Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday’s final. The 23-year-old will sign a five-year contract. Kepa Arrizabalaga <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/01/transfer-latest-arsenal-kepa-arrizabalaga-arteta-west-ham-el-hadji-malick-diouf-slavia-prague">left Chelsea for Arsenal</a> at the start of the month.</p> 
<p>Madueke will provide much-needed cover for Bukayo Saka on the right and is also capable of playing on the left, but Mikel Arteta still wants to add more creativity. Arsenal are expected to open negotiations with Crystal Palace over Eberechi Eze, although they are yet to make a formal offer. The England international, who has a £67.5m release clause, is thought to be open to the move.</p> 
<p>Arsenal have also made progress in negotiations over a new contract for Ethan Nwaneri, who was part of the England Under-21 squad crowned European champions last month. He has attracted interest from Chelsea and clubs in Germany but is expected to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/26/myles-lewis-skelly-signs-new-arsenal-contract-five-years">join his fellow academy graduate Myles Lewis-Skelly</a> in agreeing a deal to stay.</p>
