<p>A senior New South Wales police officer signed a non-disclosure agreement when told by the federal police in early February that the motivation of the “mastermind” behind Sydney’s “fake terrorism” caravan plot was to influence prosecutions.</p> <p>Monday’s revelation – which one NSW MP labelled “extraordinary” – came during the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/19/sydney-caravan-incident-sparks-inquiry-into-who-knew-what-and-when-before-rushed-hate-speech-laws-ntwnfb">first hearing of an upper house inquiry</a> into when the premier, Chris Minns, and members of his cabinet knew that the caravan found laden with explosives in January on the outskirts of Sydney was not a terrorism event.</p> <p>Rather, state and federal police have since alleged, it was part of a conspiracy by organised crime to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/10/a-sydney-caravan-laden-with-explosives-was-a-fake-terrorism-plot-heres-what-we-know-ntwnfb">divert police resources and negotiate reduced sentences</a>.</p> <p>The inquiry was launched due to concerns that parliament was “misled” before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/15/nsw-rushed-through-laws-in-the-wake-of-antisemitic-attacks-what-happens-now-the-incidents-were-a-con-job-ntwnfb">controversial hate speech and anti-protest</a> laws were passed in late February.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/19/sydney-caravan-incident-sparks-inquiry-into-who-knew-what-and-when-before-rushed-hate-speech-laws-ntwnfb">Sydney caravan incident sparks inquiry into ‘who knew what and when’ before rushed hate speech laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NSW deputy commissioner David Hudson told the hearing on Monday that state police had repeatedly asked the Australian federal police about the motivation of a key player “however their internal policies prevented them from doing that”.</p> <p>“The senior investigating officer from NSW who sat over the top of that investigation was informed at some stage, I think it was around the 10th of February. However, he was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement,” Hudson said on Monday.</p> <p>Nationals MP Wes Fang on Monday responded: “Whoa, that’s extraordinary.”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Hudson said investigators were told about the mastermind’s alleged motivation on 21 February. This was the same day the police internally – but not publicly – ruled out the incident being a potential terror event and the controversial legislation passed the NSW parliament.</p> <p>Hudson said police then awaited legal advice – which was provided on 5 March – as to whether those involved in the incident could be charged under terrorism offences. They could not, he told the inquiry.</p> <p>Hudson said he briefed the NSW police minister, Yasmin Catley, on 7 March after she asked for an update and ahead of federal police announcing to the public on 10 March that the caravan plot was a “con job”.</p> <p>Asked if Hudson had a conversation with Minns or Catley on 21 February, he said: “Not to my recollection, no. I’ll check my notes, but I don’t remember that specific date.”</p> <p>The NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, also appeared at Monday’s hearing alongside the deputy commissioner Peter Thurtell. Webb said she had “scheduled updates” with Minns and Catley.</p> <p>“I can provide those. I just don’t have them in front of me immediately, but we had scheduled meetings,” Webb said.</p> <p>Hudson revealed that Minns and Catley had incorrectly told the public that there had been “700 instances of antisemitic attacks”.</p> <p>Hudson told the inquiry that figure, which came from data collected by police, included both antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents since 11 October 2023.</p> <p>Catley last month said that “there have been more than 700 antisemitic events and incidents and arrests in this city”.</p> <p>The following day, Minns told the ABC: “There have been 700 instances of antisemitic attacks over the summer.”</p> <p>Thurtell confirmed during the hearing that of the 700 incidents, 41% were antisemitic, 15% Islamophobic and the rest classed as “other”. “This is a loose capture of what’s been happening since October 2023,” he said.</p> <p>Under questioning from Labor MP Bob Nanva, Thurtell said that 41% equated to 329 antisemitic incidents, and that investigating antisemitic incidents had become an operational focus for police since 7 October 2023.</p> <p>Asked by Nana if it was a fair assessment to say the caravan plot was an “opportunistic” one to “exploit and, frankly, leverage the fear that existed in the Jewish community”, Thurtell said: “I can only speculate that that is what they believed would achieve their ends that they were seeking to achieve.”</p> <p>Thurtell agreed under questioning from Nanva that the government introducing a package of reforms or giving police additional powers was “unremarkable”.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/10/a-sydney-caravan-laden-with-explosives-was-a-fake-terrorism-plot-heres-what-we-know-ntwnfb">AFP said in mid-March</a> that the caravan was “never going to cause a mass casualty event” and was a “fake terrorism plot”.</p> <p>AFP deputy commissioner Krissy Barrett said at the time: “We believe the person pulling the strings wanted changes to their criminal status but maintained a distance from their scheme and hired alleged local criminals to carry out parts of their plan.”</p> <p>Barrett said an “AFP operational strategy” was in place to “take action against this individual”. The NSW hearing continues.</p>
