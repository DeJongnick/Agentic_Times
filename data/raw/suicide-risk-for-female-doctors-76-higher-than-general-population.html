<p>Suicide risk is significantly higher for female doctors compared with the general population, according to an analysis of evidence from 20 countries.</p> <p>The researchers said that while suicide rates among doctors have declined over time, and risk varied across different countries and regions, the results highlighted a need for continued research and prevention efforts.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078964">Their findings were published</a> in the BMJ journal.</p> <p>According to previous estimates, one doctor dies by suicide every day in the US, and about one every 10 days in the UK, but evidence on suicide rates for physicians is inconsistent across countries.</p> <p>To address this, researchers led by the University of Vienna in Austria analysed the results of observational studies published between 1960 and 2024 that compared suicides rates among doctors with the general population.</p> <p>A total of 39 studies from 20 countries were included. The researchers found no overall increase in suicide risk for male doctors compared with the general population. For female doctors, however, suicide risk was significantly higher (76%) than the general population, the BMJ reported.</p> <p>While there was no overall increase found among male physicians when compared with the general public, a separate analysis of the data revealed male doctors did have a higher risk of suicide compared with other professional groups with “similar socioeconomic status”.</p> <p>Analysis of the 10 most recent studies compared with older studies showed a decline in suicide rates over time for both male and female doctors.</p> <p>“Overall, this study highlights the ongoing need for suicide prevention measures among physicians,” the research team wrote in the BMJ.</p> <p>“We found evidence for increased suicide rates in female physicians compared with the general population, and for male physicians compared with other professionals.</p> <p>“The recent Covid-19 pandemic has put additional strain on the mental health of physicians, potentially exacerbating risk factors for suicide such as depression and substance use.”</p> <p>In a linked editorial, experts from Doctors in Distress, a charity offering support to healthcare workers, wrote: “Persistently high rates of suicide among female doctors need particularly urgent attention from researchers, health leaders and policy makers, including studies to explore likely contributors such as discrimination and sexual harassment, to characterise those at highest risk and to develop and evaluate gender specific interventions to protect female doctors’ mental health.</p> <p>“All doctors must have access to early intervention and confidential treatment services so that they do not suffer in silence.”</p> <p>Katie Hardcastle, a senior research manager at Samaritans, said: “We’re concerned this new global evidence suggests an increased suicide risk in female doctors, as it builds on what we know from national data about risk among female health professionals, particularly nurses.</p> <p>“It’s vital that all health workers who might be struggling are encouraged and supported to seek help when needed.”</p> <p>In the UK, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs">the NHS</a> said staff wellbeing was a crucial part of its workforce plan.</p> <p>A spokesperson added: “There is a range of mental health support available for staff, including access to 24/7 confidential support services, coaching and flexible working options, but we know there is much more to do to ensure everyone working in the NHS feels comfortable asking for help and receives the right support when they do.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.ie">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.
