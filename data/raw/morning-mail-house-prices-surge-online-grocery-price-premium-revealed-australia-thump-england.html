<p>Morning everyone. In good news for some and depressing news for others, house prices have risen at their fastest rate for four years boosted by interest rate cuts and the extension of the government’s first-home guarantee. In more money news, a Choice survey shows that rapid-delivery groceries are almost 40% more expensive.</p> 
<p>Plus we look at Sussan Ley’s net zero dilemma, we have a maths challenge, and Australia’s women have walloped England by six wickets in the World Cup.</p>
