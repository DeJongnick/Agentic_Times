<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/24/emily-wurramara-artist-interview-playlist-music">Emily Wurramara</a> expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine and “all Indigenous peoples around the world” experiencing oppression as she accepted the artist of the year award at the 21st National Indigenous Music awards at the Nimas in Garramilla/Darwin on Saturday night.</p> <p>“There’s nothing like coming back home and being here and playing for mob and playing for the people,” the Garramilla-born Warnindhilyagwa singer said. “Because the music is about the people. The music is freedom. Free Palestine, free Congo and free all Indigenous peoples around the world from their oppressors. It always was, always will be Indigenous land.”</p> <p>Speaking to Guardian Australia after the ceremony, Wurramara said: “I’ve been very vocal about it online … advocating for [Palestinians] and Indigenous people all across the world - it’s our fight.”</p>    <p>Wurramara also picked up film clip of the year for Lordy Lordy, shot on Larrakia country, directed by Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore and featuring the Northern Territory’s Red Flag Dancers and members of Wurramara’s family.</p> <p>Lordy Lordy was written during Australia’s voice to parliament referendum. “This song is a reminder that our people always have a voice, and always will,” the singer said.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HW2spZKS9s"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7HW2spZKS9s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Malyangapa Barkindji rapper Barkaa, who won artist of the year at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/10/national-indigenous-music-awards-2024-winner-barkaa-artist-of-the-year?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">2024 Nimas</a>, won album of the year for Big Tidda, her second EP, edging out fellow nominees Wurramara, 3%, King Stingray and Yolŋu funk outfit Andrew Gurruwiwi Band.</p> <p>The singer told Guardian the EP is “for my tiddas - it’s for my sisters, it’s for the black matriarchy, it’s for black women. It’s a dedication to my mother, to my daughter, to my nieces, to my big sisters”.</p> <p>“The Nimas are such a special night, because it’s celebrating Black unity; celebrating all our brothers and sisters and countrymen from across this country, and just being able to come together. And you know, when one of us wins, we all win.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--supporting"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/07/national-indigenous-fashion-award-nifa-winners-2025-australia">‘Proud to call this woman my mother’: artist wins National Indigenous fashion award for tribute to daughter Barkaa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrew Gurruwiwi Band, hailing from Yirrkala in north-east Arnhem Land, won best new talent and song of the year for their reggae-inflected protest song Once Upon A Time, addressing colonisation, the frontier wars and the Yolŋu fight for land rights.</p> <p>For the second year in a row, the community clip of the year, recognising young talent, was awarded to Bulman school and community in the NT, for their video Crocodile Style, in which local kids rap in English and Dalabon about the story of Korlomomo (crocodile) and Berrerdberred (rainbow bee eater) and how humans came to have fire.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbw7PGM5Aak"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kbw7PGM5Aak?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Jessica Mauboy, the Garramilla/Darwin-born, Kuku Yalanji and Wakaman singer and actor, was inducted into the Nimas hall of fame as part of this year’s ceremony, joining the likes of Warumpi Band’s Sammy Butcher, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/14/loud-and-proud-wrong-and-strong-the-yolu-surf-rock-of-yothu-yindis-next-generation">Yothu Yindi</a> and the late <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/09/we-underestimated-gurrumul-an-unlikely-career-on-the-edge-of-two-worlds">Gurrumul</a>.</p> <p>The award recognises Mauboy’s success as a recording artist and her impact on Australian music.
