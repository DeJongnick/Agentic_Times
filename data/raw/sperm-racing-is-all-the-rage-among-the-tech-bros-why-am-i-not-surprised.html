<h1>Sperm racing is all the rage among the tech bros. Why am I not surprised?</h1>

<p>Remember when Elon Musk challenged Vladimir Putin to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musks-combat-challenge-putin-prompts-mockery-russia-2022-03-16/">physical combat</a> and Mark Zuckerberg to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/16/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-cage-fight">cage fight</a>? Neither of those brawls took place for various reasons. Not least, I suspect, because Musk is just self-aware enough to know that he would not emerge with his dignity, or his spine, intact. However, if the richest man in the world is still casting around for a way to publicly demonstrate his virility, I think I’ve hit on the perfect way: sperm racing.</p> <p>This isn’t some below-the-belt insult. <a href="https://www.spermracing.com/races">Sperm racing</a> is an emerging “thing” among tech types now. A teenage entrepreneur called Eric Zhu came up with the idea, and went viral with <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a64689694/sperm-racing-event-la-review/">his first sperm race</a> in April. That initial race was rudimentary: college students gave sperm samples to be analysed and the results were turned into an animated race that visualised the fastest offerings.</p> <p>Since then, things have got more sophisticated: the company has developed a real-time race mechanism. According to <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/09/27/sperm-racing-investors-blow-10-million-seed-round-sports-venture/">the San Francisco Standard</a>, investors have valued Sperm Racing at $75m and it recently got $10m in seed funding. Good for Zhu, but imagine being a teenage female founder asking for investment in an Ovulation Olympics; you’d get laughed out of the room. That’s if you were even let in the room: wholly women-led companies in the US got just 1% of venture capital funding in 2024.</p> <p>While sperm racing started off as a joke, it’s now being presented as a health initiative. “Male fertility is declining. Like, a lot,” the company manifesto says. “Sperm racing isn’t just about racing sperm (although, let’s be honest, that’s hilarious). It’s about turning health into a competition. It’s about making male fertility something people actually want to talk about, track and improve.” The company is also hawking a supplement called Sperm Worms.</p>    <p>In many ways, sperm racing is ingenious. Fertility is often thought of as a women’s issue; this helps reframe sperm motility (not exactly a dinner-table conversation) in an engaging way. Getting young men to think more deeply about their reproductive health is great. But “turning health into a competition”? Big yikes. Does that mean anyone who isn’t in perfect health is a loser? Because that’s sure what it sounds like.</p> <p>Still, what more do you expect from tech bros? Sperm racing reflects three trends dominating Silicon Valley: a fixation on traditional masculinity; an obsession with treating your body like a machine that can be constantly optimised; and an increased interest in fertility that overlaps with a worrying <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/podcasts/the-21st-century-resurgence-of-eugenics/">resurgence in eugenics</a>.</p> <p>You can quite literally see Silicon Valley conforming to more rigid ideas of masculinity over the years. Once, the stereotype of a tech bro was a sweet-looking dork with zero fashion sense and nonexistent biceps. Just Google <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvuJCeV3K0o">Jeff Bezos</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ztyl0z/elon_musk_in_his_paypal_days_in_2000/">Elon Musk</a> in 2000, or <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/facebook-founder-is-times-person-of-2010-10490401">Mark Zuckerberg</a> in 2010. (And do it quick, before they scrub all evidence from the internet.) As technology companies amassed wealth and power, however, there was a vibe shift. Founders started bulking up and doing mixed martial arts. Zuckerberg, who once paid lip service to diversity, started lamenting the lack of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/18/mark-zuckerberg-masculine-energy">masculine energy</a>” in corporate culture. And, in parallel with a broader cultural interest in testosterone that manifested in people such as Tucker Carlson promoting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/tucker-carlson-masculinity-crisis-testicle-tanning">testicle tanning</a> and podcasters like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJWmJo3w_0Y">Andrew Huberman</a> giving tips on the best testosterone-related supplement stacks, one founder started hosting “<a href="https://www.them.us/story/testosterone-parties-silicon-valley">T Parties</a>”, where men got together to test and compare their testosterone levels.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/10/elon-musk-trillion-dollar-pay-deal-tesla">What do you call Elon Musk’s trillion-dollar pay deal? Obscene | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Concurrently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/what-is-pronatalism-right-wing-republican">pronatalism in Silicon Valley</a> is rising, and fertility technology is booming. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing – except a lot of the big bucks being funnelled into fertility don’t seem to be going towards solving macro problems such as reducing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/dec/04/air-pollution-infertility-risk">air pollution</a> or <a href="https://weillcornell.org/news/microplastics-in-testicles-may-play-a-role-in-male-infertility-study-suggests">microplastics</a>, both of which have been linked to infertility, but rather to flashy ideas such as sperm races or finding ways to help the well-off produce uber-optimised children. A number of <a href="https://futurism.com/ivf-startup-embryo-iq">controversial embryo-testing startups</a> have offered to help parents select a future child with the best possible <a href="https://whyy.org/segments/startup-offers-genetic-testing-that-promises-to-predict-healthiest-embryo/">genes</a>, based on “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/oct/18/what-is-genomic-prediction-and-can-embryos-really-be-screened-for-iq">desirable traits</a>” and genetic predictions of intelligence.</p> <p>Anyway, problematic or not, expect to see more of this: Zhu has reportedly partnered with a company called Total Frat Move to run sperm races at colleges. I hope that one of the professors there can take a few minutes to explain that the idea of sperm scrambling to get to a waiting egg is something of a <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-idea-that-sperm-race-to-the-egg-is-just-another-macho-myth">macho myth</a>. Research shows <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/09/health/sperm-choice-female-eggs-wellness">the egg actually has the final say</a> on which sperm fertilises it. Which may be a hard nut for some of these boys to crack.</p> <p>• Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
