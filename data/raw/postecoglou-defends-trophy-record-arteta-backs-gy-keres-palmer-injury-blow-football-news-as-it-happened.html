He’s incapable of humility or of being willing to learn a lesson. I’ve been a Spurs fan for the best part of 56 years and the football that we were playing in the league at the end of last season was truly some of the worst that I can ever remember. </p> <p>“With all due respect to the Australian and Japanese leagues, success there is of virtually no importance when compared with a league like the Premiere League. And Celtic have won 11 of the last 12 Scottish Premierships.</p> <p>“He had a period of short success when he first arrived at Spurs because people were understandably dazzled by his own sense of self. But it quickly became clear that there was no Plan B and if that you peeled away those layers of self-aggrandrisement, there was absolutely nothing there - no plan, no pragmatism, no clue. I feel genuinely sorry for the Forest fans.”</p> <p>No holds barred there.

However I think he made a mistake coming back to manage in the same league so quickly.</p> <p>“He was on a terrible run of form in the league (and to be honest we were pretty lousy for large portions of the the Europa league. We were lucky to scuff a goal in against a similarly abject team). If he had gone elsewhere and done well, or just taken some time off, he would have hit the ground at a new club with some excitement and would be able to style out the ‘I win a trophy’ bravado. But after being sacked and the subsequent manager being lauded as sorting out many of the problems left by Ange means his statements just look hubristic.”</p> <p><strong>Justin Madson:</strong> “Big Ange is really facing a difficult task which isn’t being helped by the constant questioning and over-analysis over the validity of his work by a media who critical of his hiring since it was rumored. It’s enough to drive any sane man over the edge.</p> <p>“A note that wasn’t mentioned in the blog here is his very valid point that losing one of England’s all time best strikers in Kane would have an impact on any team. Not to mention multiple injury issues to important players like Kulusevski, and questionable reinvestment of funds after Kane’s departure. While nobody will argue that Thomas Frank is an excellent coach, it would have been interesting to see what Ange could have done with this team. Some might say he even deserved the chance to try.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-17T15:40:28.119Z">at 4.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68f260458f089def4b071d86" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-17T15:36:47.188Z">4.36pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Rangers latest: the new favourite to succeed Russell Martin</strong>, Steven Gerrard having decided to not grasp the chalice last week (mixed metaphor alert).

I can’t be the only nerd out there who’d like to ask obscure music history questions to the finest minds at The Guardian and by proxy the wider readership. This is a multi-million pound idea that could save journalism as we know it and I’m offering it for free! </p> <p>“Secondly, speaking as a Spurs fan, I was never as taken with Postecoglou’s “straight talking” as so many others seemed to be. To me, he always seemed to be a pretty aggy and contrarian so-and-so, especially after results stopped going our way. His multiple run ins with fans I think further indicate that Big Ange just Loves the Drama, personally. </p> <p>“I’d feel a lot more kindly towards him if he exercised a little humility - I don’t see why he doesn’t acknowledge that the Premier League is a more challenging environment than anywhere else he’s worked and his achievements, whilst excellent, simply aren’t like-for-like. If he truly believed he’s been operating at the same level, why would he have left Scotland/Japan/Australia in the first place?”</p> <p>Thanks, Jack.

If not, you have to go somewhere else because the pressure is gone, the expectation is going to be there. If you put on the number 9 shirt for Arsenal, you have to be able to say in six games, [if] I don’t score, I’m a different player? I start to act in a different way? I want much more of the same of what he’s doing and when we have those opportunities, put it. I’m sure it’s going to happen.”</p> <p>Arteta added: “It’s part of football.

It’s an interesting question. Obviously in the past four or five years we’ve had different types of managers, there is no guarantee of success anywhere, and it’s really difficult to guarantee success when you’re at a club where the expectation is to win all the time.</p> <p>“That’s never going to happen. But we’ve experienced different managers, whether it be managers that have played here, managers have been deemed head coach types that are more tactical.</p> <p>“So we’ve had every type of manager, but the priority is always to win. I was a young player [when Muscat was at Rangers], so I only came across him a few times. When I was a young player, my job used to be to clean Alex McLeish and the coaching staff’s boots, so I used to pass him in the corridor and, again, as a person, he was really pleasant.</p> <p>“I know there’s a reputation there as a player.
