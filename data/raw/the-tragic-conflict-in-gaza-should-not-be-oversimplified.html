<p>Owen Jones’s article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/23/israel-leaders-genocide-gaza-political-media-power">Israel’s leaders committed genocide in Gaza and must pay for it. Their political and media allies must too, 23 January</a>) oversimplifies the deeply complex and tragic conflict in Gaza, diluting the seriousness of his arguments.</p> <p>While he condemns the west’s supply of weapons to Israel, he ignores the global arms trade that fuels violence on both sides. Hamas and other militant groups have also received weapons, and the international community has failed to address this. Critiquing only one side’s arms supply neglects the broader dynamics that perpetuate this conflict.</p> <p>Jones also frames morality around the number of casualties, highlighting Palestinian civilian deaths while downplaying Israeli suffering. The killing of civilians, especially children, is immoral regardless of scale or side. A numbers-based approach risks creating a false moral hierarchy and trivialising individual tragedies.</p> <p>Lastly, Jones critiques the media for enabling Israel’s actions but fails to address how sensationalism and oversimplification in reporting have failed both sides. Media narratives, well demonstrated in Jones’s article, often present this conflict as a battle between oppressor and oppressed, ignoring the shared culpability and the humanity of all victims. Journalism should hold all parties accountable rather than seeking attention-grabbing headlines.</p> <p>Acknowledging the inhumane actions of both Hamas and the Israeli leadership strengthens the case for justice and peace. Supporting the Palestinian cause does not mean absolving Hamas, just as defending Israel cannot ignore its policies towards Palestinians. True accountability lies in recognising the suffering on both sides and demanding global action to prevent further violence.</p> <p>The real shame is the failure of the international community, which has allowed this tragedy to escalate. It is time for the media to reject black-and-white narratives and support a solution based on empathy, accountability and systemic change.<br><strong>Boaz Tal</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• Not for the first time, I detect a real sense of despair in Owen Jones’s words on the desperately sad situation in Gaza. I also share that despair, and indeed the rage, that he so obviously feels and expresses so eloquently about the complicity of our politicians and media in the atrocities perpetrated on the Palestinian people. What can I say to him to give him hope? Quote the words of the late, brilliant Edward Said to explain the Alice Through the Looking Glass prism the media have come to represent the conflict in the Middle East through? Or perhaps I can simply say this: while we write, we maintain the line, and strengthen the general intellect, and thus, hope for the future.<br><strong>Desmond Hewitt</strong><br><em>Marlborough, Wiltshire</em></p>
