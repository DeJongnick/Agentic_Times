<p>At the risk of sounding like an infomercial, have you ever felt frustrated by your liquid laundry detergent? For example, has the bottle ever leaked and made a huge mess, did the weight ever make it difficult to pour, or have you ever wished there was a more travel-friendly version? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you should check out laundry detergent sheets.</p> <p>I’ve written entire guides to laundry detergents, including performing lab tests, and detergent sheets are easily one of the most convenient ways to wash your clothes.</p> <h2>What are laundry detergent sheets?</h2>    <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/15/laundry-101-why-cheap-detergent-is-fine-and-how-to-decode-garment-care-symbols">Laundry</a> detergent sheets are cellulose pads that are soaked with detergent. When you toss them into the drum of your washer, the cellulose dissolves during the initial rinse and distributes the soap.</p> <h2>What are the advantages of laundry detergent sheets?</h2>   <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2023/dec/14/laundry-clothes-expert-guide">Are you doing laundry all wrong? An expert guide to caring for your clothes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First off, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/24/all-suds-no-substance-some-laundry-detergent-sheets-no-better-than-water-for-stain-removal-choice-study-finds">detergent sheets</a> tend to be more eco-friendly than liquid detergents. I’ve weighed sheets from a dozen different brands, and most weigh just a bit more than a penny at 3 grams. An equivalent dose of liquid detergent is about 25 grams. So it takes a lot less fuel to ship a month’s worth of laundry soap in sheet form. Plus, some brands are completely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/plastic-free">plastic-free</a>.</p> <p>Next, I find them much easier to use. In most cases, you just toss a sheet into the washer’s drum and you’re done. There’s no need to measure or pour anything. This can be especially useful if you have less hand strength.</p>    <p>Finally, the storage is a cinch. A sleeve of detergent sheets takes up less space, won’t ever leak, and can be dropped or crushed without any risk to the product. Plus, if you travel a lot, you can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter-us/2025/oct/04/travel-essentials-packing-list-us">toss a few into your suitcase</a>. They’re not liquid, so they can go on a plane, and with them, you can circumvent paying a hotel an arm and a leg for a bag of laundry.</p> <h2>Which laundry detergent sheet brand should I use?</h2>    <p>I’ve tried quite a few laundry detergent sheet brands. For most people, I’d recommend <a href="https://www.heysunday.com/">HeySunday</a>. It’s an online brand that offers convenient, one-purchase options and discounts for recurring shipments. At the time of writing, the sheets cost between 25 and 31 cents a load.</p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.heysunday.com/laundry-sheets" > $15.00 at HeySunday </a>  <p>HeySunday checks all my major boxes. It’s septic- and hand-wash safe and biodegradable, which means you can do your laundry anywhere from a hotel sink to a campground basin.</p> <p>Cleaning-wise, HeySunday removes stains as well or better than other detergent sheets. However, I tried the Ocean Breeze ones and really liked the pleasant scent they imparted to my laundry.</p>
