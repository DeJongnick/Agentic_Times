<p>Lloyds Banking Group has warned it is likely to take a greater hit from the motor finance scandal than expected, with the final cost exceeding the £1.2bn it had set aside.</p> 
<p>Close Brothers, one of the UK’s biggest providers of car loans, also said that the proposed compensation scheme for victims was “likely to result in a material increase in its existing provision of £165m”.</p> 
<p>The higher compensation provisions come despite the City regulator saying on Tuesday night that people who were mis-sold car finance were likely to receive compensation payouts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/07/uk-car-loan-scandal-victims-in-line-for-payout-fca">averaging £700 from about 14m unfair loans</a>, less than the £950 payouts previously anticipated.</p> 
<p>Shares <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/oct/08/spot-gold-rises-above-4000-first-time-vertu-motors-warns-profit-hit-jlr-disruption-federal-reserve-imf-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68e618a48f08ca5de7d827dd#block-68e618a48f08ca5de7d827dd">in car finance lenders</a>, including Lloyds, rallied in response on Wednesday. However, Lloyds’ stock fell by more than 3% on Thursday morning after it indicated the bigger than expected costs. Close Brothers shares plunged by nearly 10%.</p>

<p>The Financial Conduct Authority put lenders’ total compensation bill at £8.2bn, although it could rise to £9.7bn. This is at the bottom end of its earlier forecast range of between £9bn and £18bn.</p> 
<p>However, Lloyds said on Thursday: “Based on our initial analysis and the characteristics of the proposed scheme, an additional provision is likely to be required which may be material.”</p> 
<p>The bank added that there were uncertainties around the interpretation and implementation of the proposals, and that further analysis was needed.</p> 
<p>The high street bank in February <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/20/lloyds-puts-aside-another-700m-for-compensation-over-car-finance-scandal">set aside a further £700m to cover compensation payments</a> to customers, taking its total provision to almost £1.2bn.</p> 
<p>Its provisions have weighed on its financial performance, pushing its 2024 pre-tax profits down by 20%, to just under £6bn. At the time, RBC Capital estimated that the bank could ultimately be on the hook for up to £4.6bn.</p> 
<p>The car finance scandal is the biggest since the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling debacle, where 34 million consumers received an average of about £1,000 each. Lloyds was also the most exposed to that scandal.</p> 
<p>Steve Clayton, the head of equity funds at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The statement from Lloyds was not in the market’s playbook and the shares have reacted badly, erasing yesterday’s gains, with Close Brothers similarly impacted.”</p> 
<p>Separately on Thursday, the specialist lender Secure Trust issued a profit warning, sending its shares more than 16% lower. It now expects its underlying pre-tax profit this year to fall below analysts’ expectations by up to £9m, due to the performance of its car finance division. However, it remains confident of 30% year-on-year growth in profits.</p> 
<p>Secure Trust is in the process of exiting vehicle finance, which may require additional provisions for onerous supplier contracts, which would be treated as exceptional costs.</p> 
<p>The motor and property finance specialist S&amp;U released upbeat financial results, reporting a profit before tax of £15.6m for six months to 5 August, up 22% on a year earlier. Its share price rose by 1.5%.</p> 
<p>It set aside nearly £8m for motor finance in the period, against £18m a year earlier.</p>
