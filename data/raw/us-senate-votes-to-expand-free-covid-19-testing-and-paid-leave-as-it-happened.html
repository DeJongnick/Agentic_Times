  <p><strong>The temporary policies that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has announced in response to the coronavirus pandemic resemble the Obama administration’s “felons, not families” approach. </strong><br></p> 
  <p>Under the previous administration, immigrants without serious criminal offenses were often spared deportation. Donald Trump changed priorities, and his administration has often underscored that all undocumented immigrants are subject to deportation. </p> 
  <p>The new Ice policy comes after immigration lawyers joined with labor unions representing Ice prosecutors and immigration judges to ask the Justice Department to temporarily close the immigration courts. Though there are no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ice detention facilities, doctors and public health officials have warned that detained populations are at high risk. </p> 
  <p>It’s unclear whether the 37,000 people already in Ice detention will remain there. Overcrowding at detention facilities puts not only those who are detained but also enforcement agents and officers at risk, according to the internal watchdog for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Ice. </p> 
  <p>Although no cases of coronavirus have been confirmed at detention centers, one person was evaluated with coronavirus symptoms at a facility in San Diego. Another center in Washington state’s King’s county closed for two weeks due to concerns that an employee was infected. </p> 
  <p>The enforcement agency has not said for how long the new policies will be in place. </p>

  <p>Melania Trump will appear in public service announcements that “address the “important ways Americans can protect themselves and those most at risk” from contracting and spreading the coronavirus, according to the White House. </p> 
  <p>Coronavirus PSAs featuring Surgeon General Jerome Adams, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx and other officials will also be nationally broadcast. It’s unclear when these will launch. </p> 
  <p>Melania Trump has been notably disengaged from the White House’s messaging on coronavirus thus far. On Tuesday, she tweeted, “Consider taking advantage of time working from home to connect with your loved ones via email or FaceTime, spend time w family, or work on your well-being by reading a book or spending time on a hobby,” apparently unaware that most people who work from home have to spend their time ... working. </p>

  <p><strong>McDaniel is one of nearly 60,000 people who have been tested in the US, as public health experts continue to raise concerns about shortages.</strong> The Guardian’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauren-aratani"> Lauren Aratani</a> reports that not everyone who needs a test has been able to get one: </p> 
  <p><strong>Who is getting tested in the US?</strong><br></p> 
  <p>Decisions about who is getting tested are being made at the county and state level.</p> 
  <p>Broadly, CDC guidelines to healthcare professionals say that those tested must be showing symptoms, and priority is given to those who are in hospital, are at risk for the virus’s most deadly effects (elderly people and those with chronic medical conditions or weakened immune systems) or had known contact with a person who tested positive as priorities for testing. The CDC also says those who have a history of travel from “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html">affected geographic areas</a>” – China, Iran, South Korea and parts of Europe – should be prioritized.</p> 
  <p>But there appears to be no guarantee of a test. Over the past few weeks, there has been a flood of stories of people who are symptomatic and should be prioritized by testing, but were not: for example, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-17/wife-cpr-died-coronavirus-test">elderly husband </a>of a coronavirus patient who died from the illness, <a href="https://khn.org/news/surging-health-care-worker-quarantines-raise-concerns-as-coronavirus-spreads/">healthcare workers </a>who may have been exposed to the virus and countless numbers of symptomatic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/16/trump-coronavirus-test-covad-19-new-york">travelers</a> to countries with known outbreaks.</p> 
  <p>Those who have been tested have often described <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/nyregion/coronavirus-testing-positive.html">frustrating</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/who-gets-tested-coronavirus/607999/">experiences</a> of being sent from one place to another seeking a test.</p> 
  <p>Fueling the frustration are stories of high-profile figures who have managed to get tested. The NBA got 58 tests <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/03/13/how-utah-jazz-got-coronavirus-tests-during-national-shortage/5046539002/">within six hours</a> for players of the Utah Jazz, though it is unclear how many players were actually showing symptoms. A fashion influencer who had body aches and a fever was <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/something-navy-influencer-arielle-charnas-coronavirus">tested</a> with the help of a friend, after other doctors she spoke with told her she did not qualify for testing in New York state.</p>

  <p><strong>One Native American tribe’s trailblazing coronavirus response: </strong></p> 
  <p>The Lummi nation, a sovereign Native American tribe in the Pacific north-west, will soon open a pioneering field hospital to treat coronavirus patients, as part of a wave of strong public health measures which have gone further than many governments.</p> 
  <p>Tribal leaders have been preparing for Covid-19 since the virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, with medical staff beefing up emergency plans, reorganizing services and gathering medical supplies, including test kits and personal protective equipment.</p> 
  <p>The Lummi reservation is located in Whatcom county – 115 miles north of Seattle, Washington, where the first US Covid-19 case was confirmed in January, followed by the first death in February.</p> 
  <p>So far, the tribe has reported three Covid-19 cases, but expect numbers to rise as the pandemic progresses.</p> 
  <p>As the Trump administration stalled, the tribe swiftly introduced mitigation and prevention measures such as social distancing, drive-through testing, telemedicine clinics, and a home delivery service for the elderly.<br></p> 
  <p>The tribal council declared a state of emergency on 3 March – 10 days before Donald Trump did the same in the US – and approved $1m to prepare and respond for the evolving pandemic, which includes setting up the hospital.</p>

  <p><strong>Donald Trump announced plans to formally nominate Russ Vought to direct the Office of Management and Budget. </strong>Vought has served as the acting director of the office for more than a year. </p>

  <p>Last week, <a href="https://thehill.com/people/matt-cartwright">Matt Cartwright</a>, a Democratic representative of Pennsylvania, pushed Vought on Trump’s proposal to cut Health and Human Services funding by $9.5 billion.

  <p>“If you’re asking if I’m sending up a budget amendment, no, I’m not sending up a budget amendment,” Vought said.<br></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Today so far</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours.</p> 
  <p>Here’s where the day stands so far:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>The Senate passed the second coronavirus bill, </strong>which expands paid sick leave and provides funding for free testing, on a vote of 90-8. It now heads to <strong>Trump</strong>’s desk for his signature.</li> 
   <li><strong>The Dow closed down more than 1,300 points, </strong>marking another dismal day for the markets as investors panic over the coronavirus crisis. With today’s drop, nearly all the stock market gains since Trump took office have been wiped out.</li> 
   <li><strong>Bernie Sanders’ campaign said he was assessing the path forward for his presidential bid, </strong>after <strong>Joe Biden </strong>completed a three-state sweep last night and moved closer toward securing the Democratic nomination.</li> 
   <li><strong>The US-Canadian border will be closed to all non-essential travel </strong>in the hope of mitigating the spread of coronavirus. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister <strong>Justin Trudeau </strong>said the two countries had mutually agreed to the closure.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned.</p>

  <p>Trump said his press conference with FDA officials, which he previewed on Twitter earlier today, would take place tomorrow. “The FDA will be working very very hard, and I appreciate what they’re doing,” Trump said.</p> 
  <p>The president also said he was impressed by the “tremendous spirit” he was seeing in the country.</p> 
  <p>“Even Republicans and Democrats are getting together, for the most part, but they’re getting together,” said Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Democratic lawmakers amid the crisis. “So that’s a good thing to see.” </p>

  <p>Puerto Rico has requested US authorities suspend national and international flights for two weeks - in a last ditch effort to lock down the carribean island and prevent localized spread of Covid-19. </p> 
  <p>Governor <strong>Wanda Vázquez</strong> has also asked Federal Aviation Administrator,<strong> Stephen Marshall</strong>, to close all airports where local authorities aren’t screening incoming passengers and limit the air-strips where charter planes can land.</p> 
  <p>Puerto Rico, a US territory of 3.2 million people, has five confirmed Covid-19 cases, with 21 others currently awaiting test results. All five cases are linked to travel. The island’s overburdened healthcare system, weak sanitation system and aging population, make it vulnerable to the spread of the coronavirus.</p> 
  <p>Today’s intervention is the latest in a series of dramatic measures since the weekend when Vázquez imposed a curfew from 9pm and 5am, and ordered all non-essential businesses to close until the end of March The island, which depends heavily on tourism, has suspended cruise ships from docking, and is screening incoming passengers at its main international airport in the capital San Juan. </p>

  <p><strong>The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports:</strong></p> 
  <p>The US Census Bureau announced Wednesday <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/operational-update.html">it was suspending</a> all of its field operations to get people to respond to the 2020 census, the decennial survey that aims to count every person in America.</p> 
  <p>The Bureau said it would suspend its field operations until April 1, and encouraged people to <a href="https://my2020census.gov/">respond online</a> or by telephone in the meantime. The decision stalls years of careful planning to get people to respond to the survey.</p> 
  <p>The Bureau still has plans to send out field workers in May to follow up with people who fail to self-respond, a critical effort that aims to ensure hard-to-count groups get counted. The Bureau said Wednesday it would adjust that operation as necessary to follow the guidance of public health authorities.</p> 
  <p>The decision, made to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, came about a week after Americans began filling out the survey. The results of the census have profound political consequences -- the data is used to allocate $1.5 trillion in federal funding and to draw electoral districts in place for the next decade. The decennial census is mandated by the constitution.</p> 
  <p>Coronavirus concerns add to a pile of challenges facing the bureau. There is considerable concern that minorities and immigrant groups will be fearful of responding to the survey because of the <strong>Trump administration</strong>’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies. Individual census responses must be kept confidential by law. </p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>•The government has closed the US-Canada border to “non-essential traffic”, Donald Trump announced</strong>, as the number of coronavirus cases continued to rise. Speaking at a White House press conference, Trump also said the government was preparing new test kits, but did not elaborate on a new financial package to combat the impact of Covid-19.</p> 
  <p><strong>•The aid package proposed by the White House would direct $1tn to businesses and individuals. </strong>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/18/joe-biden-wins-democratic-primaries-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-coronavirus-live-updates?page=with:block-5e723cbb8f085c6327bc25d8#block-5e723cbb8f085c6327bc25d8">treasury department memo</a> said $500bn could be spent on two separate payments to Americans. The plan also provides $50bn for the airline industry, and $150bn for other effected businesses.</p> 
  <p><strong>•Bernie Sanders is ‘assessing the path forward’ for his campaign, after a disappointing showing on Tuesday. </strong>Sander’s campaign manager said the senator would travel to his home state of Vermont today, where Sanders and his wife will “begin holding conversations with supporters to get input and assess the path forward for our campaign”.</p> 
  <p><strong>•The federal government is dispatching two hospital ships to respond to the coronavirus crisis. </strong>Trump said the ships, Mercy and Comfort, were being readied. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said earlier that the Comfort was heading for New York City harbor.</p> 
  <p><strong>•Trump said he was not being racist by continuing to use the term “China virus”, </strong>even as reports emerged of bias against Asian people. Experts have warned against labelling the coronavirus based on geography as it could stigmatize ethnic groups, but Trump said it was: “Not racist at all.”</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The race is effectively over. Biden has built up an insurmountable delegate lead and, barring some major medical issue—we hear there’s a bug going around?— he will be the Democratic presidential nominee. It seemed hard to imagine that Democratic voters could speak with any clear voice just two and a half weeks ago, when there were still seven Democratic candidates jockeying for a percentage point or a delegate here and there. More than half of pledged delegates will have been allotted once Tuesday’s results are final, and Democratic voters couldn’t speak much more clearly.</p>

  <p>Rebecca Morin and Jeanine Santucci were putting together the takeaways for USA Today, and they made a key point about what the demographics from last night are telling us</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Throughout the campaign, Sanders touted his ability to bring out new voters to participate in the election and power his win. But with turnout up before the coronavirus pandemic, Sanders’ prediction didn’t pan out. Younger voters have not turned out in the numbers he needs to close the gap with Biden. A key demographic that Sanders has relied on, Latino voters, also did not help carry Sanders to victory this time. Latinos, who are not a monolithic voting bloc, did not turn to Sanders in Florida or Arizona. Biden won more Latino vote in those states than Sanders did.</p>

   <p>Sanders made no announcement Tuesday night about the future of his campaign — though things are looking pretty bleak right now. Instead, he gave a video address early in the evening that outlined how he would confront the coronavirus.

  <p>Just as a reminder, at the end of February, Trump said “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”</p> 
  <p>The number of confirmed cases in the US is currently at 6,496, and every state is affected.</p>

  <p>I’ll be posting some links to reaction around the media to Biden’s primary victories shortly, but it is not just election politics that is being affected by coronavirus. Day-to-day on Capitol Hill is going to change too.</p> 
  <p>The Associated Press are reporting this morning on how Congressional leaders are resisting calls to let lawmakers vote remotely, with it being described as a dispute which is pitting coronavirus against two centuries of tradition.</p> 
  <p>Advocates of the voting change cite the health perils of air travel at a time when health experts want people to avoid crowds. They argue that as infections spread, it may become all but impossible for many lawmakers to make the journey because of the growing risk of getting the virus.</p> 
  <p>“There was a time when physical presence was the only way to make sure that a person was present and voting,” No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Dick Durbin said on Tuesday. “I think that technology gives us other options and we better exercise them.”<br></p> 
  <p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was not having it. “We’ll not be doing that,” McConnell he told reporters. He suggested his chamber might extend roll call votes beyond the traditional 15 minutes and allow senators to vote in small groups, rather than all at once. “We will deal with the social distancing issue without fundamentally changing Senate rules,” McConnell said.</p> 
  <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose hometown of San Francisco is among many Bay Area communities whose residents have been ordered to stay home, has also opposed the idea, according to lawmakers who’ve spoken to her.</p> 
  <p>Whether these objections continue to be sustainable if the coronavirus crisis lasts for several months remains to be seen.</p>

  <p>US Surgeon General Jerome Adams has been on the TV this morning. Challenged on whether people are getting the administration’s message, he said: “I think we are starting to turn a corner and people really are, because it is starting to affect people who they see or know.”</p> 
  <p>He joked that his sons at home don’t care what dad says about staying home, even if their dad is the surgeon general, but “by golly they know that Kevin Durant just got diagnosed with the coronavirus”<br></p>

  <p>The global pandemic is straining ties between the United States and China further. Matthew Lee, diplomatic writer at Associated Press, has been looking at how coronavirus became the latest flashpoint between the two nations:</p> 
  <p>Since the virus has spread, he reports, Trump and his top aides have stepped up their criticism of China, noting consistently that the outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. They have referred to Covid-19 as the “Wuhan virus” or the “Chinese virus” on multiple occasions, disregarding World Health Organization terminology that avoids identifying the virus by geography.</p> 
  <p>On Tuesday alone, Trump discussed the Chinese source of virus outbreak during at least two events. At a State Department news conference, Mike Pompeo referred six times to Covid-19 as the “Wuhan virus”, and suggested the Chinese are attempting to distract the world from the shortcomings of its initial response.<br></p> 
  <p>In a meeting with hotel executives at the White House, Trump took pains to make clear that the virus originated in China, asking pointed questions of Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson about where the impact was first felt.</p> 
  <p>“And this all started in China? That’s where you first saw the problem and where you first got hit?” Trump asked.<br></p> 
  <p>“Absolutely,” Sorenson replied.<br></p> 
  <p>“Hopefully, you all heard that,” Trump told reporters.</p> 
  <p>Having already been targeted by Trump in a trade war and by Pompeo and others for repression of Muslim and other religious and ethnic minorities in western Xinjiang Province, the Chinese have taken particular offence to the constant repetition, complaining vociferously and suggesting that the US military may have actually introduced the virus to Wuhan.<br></p> 
  <p>“Recently, some American politicians have linked the new coronavirus with China to stigmatize China. We express strong indignation and opposition to it,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. “We urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes and stop unwarranted accusations against China.”</p> 
  <p>That, in turn, has prompted angry US protests with the State Department hauling in China’s ambassador to the United States to complain and Pompeo calling the top Chinese diplomat to re-register the anger.</p> 
  <p>“The disinformation campaign that they are waging is designed to shift responsibility,” Pompeo said, before quickly adding that “now is not the time for recriminations.”</p> 
  <p>Yet recriminations seem to be the order of the day.<br></p> 
  <p>“China was putting out information which was false that our military gave this to them,” Trump said. “That was false. And rather than having an argument I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I think it’s a very accurate term. But no, I didn’t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.”<br></p> 
  <p>Shortly after Trump’s comments, the Chinese foreign ministry announced the expulsion of American reporters from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. </p> 
  <p>Pompeo responded to that news: “I regret China’s decision today to further foreclose the world’s ability to conduct free press operations that frankly, would be really good, really good for the Chinese people in these incredibly challenging global times. Where more information, more transparency are what will save lives. This is unfortunate,” he said. “I hope they will reconsider.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Another thing we can expect today is further fall-out from the Chinese decision yesterday to expel American journalists. </p> 
  <p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing had been “compelled” to take countermeasures after Washington imposed restrictions on staff at Chinese state media outlets in the US.</p> 
  <p>“We urge the US to take off its ideological prejudice, abandon cold war mentality,” Geng said. “China is not one to start trouble, but it will not blink if trouble comes. We urge the US side to immediately stop suppressing Chinese media, otherwise the US side will lose even more.”</p> 
  <p>At least 13 journalists will be expelled in what is an unprecedented retaliation against foreign media working in the country. An announcement made just after midnight said all US journalists working for the New York Times, Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal whose credentials were up for renewal this year would have 10 days to turn in their press cards, a measure that effectively bans them from reporting in the country.</p>

  <p>Good morning. Last night <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/2020-four-states-primaries-coronavirus-election">Joe Biden swept to victory in three primaries</a> held in unprecedented circumstances. Biden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/mar/18/democratic-primary-delegate-count-latest">has now racked up 1,147 pledged delegates to Bernie Sanders’ 861</a> - a lead of 286 that surely looks to be insurmountable. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-us-elections-2020-panel">Is it time for Bernie to quit the race</a> in the interest of unifying the party during a national emergency?</p> 
  <p>Ohio cancelled its primary planned for yesterday due to the coronavirus. But with Florida, Illinois and Arizona running their primaries yesterday, predictably <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/us-elections-voters-coronavirus">voters faced confusion, a shortage of poll workers, and shifting or closed polling stations</a>. It’s clear that the way the rest of the campaign is going to be deeply affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The DNC is already urging a shift to vote-by-mail.</p>

  <p>With bars, shops, and restaurants ordered shut across parts of the nation, it is impossible to see politics being business-as-usual for some time to come.</p> 
  <p>Yesterday Donald Trump was proclaiming that he knew it was a pandemic all along - just weeks after the president promised that the 15 cases of coronavirus in the US would soon go down to zero. There’s currently - as recorded by the <a href="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a> -<strong> 6,496 confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, and the death toll has now exceeded 100. </strong></p> 
  <p>It is understandably dominating today’s White House agenda. Trump has calls and meetings with the aerospace industry, physicians, nurses, and a quarterly business roundtable. The Coronavirus Task Force will be doing a morning briefing.</p> 
  <p>We’ll be tracking the responses to Biden’s win last night and political developments around the country here.
