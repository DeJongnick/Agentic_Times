<p>The Victorian office of public prosecutions has yet to rule out contempt charges in relation to comments made on the Kyle and Jackie O Show about the triple murder trial of Erin Patterson, four months after the co-hosts were criticised by a supreme court judge.</p> <p>Justice Christopher Beale <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/07/kyle-and-jackie-o-face-prosecution-for-contempt-erin-patterson-trial-comments-ntwnfb">referred the comments</a> to the office for contempt proceedings in June, after Kyle Sandilands made comments including, “just lock that bitch up” and called the case “not strong for her”.</p> <p>The OPP said in a statement to Guardian Australia this week it was still considering whether to commence prosecutions in relation to the comments, as well as to a separate referral relating to comments made about Patterson during an event billed as “The Psychology of Serial Killers” at Hamer Hall in Melbourne.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/02/mushroom-murderer-erin-patterson-will-appeal-her-convictions-court-told-ntwnfb">Mushroom murderer Erin Patterson will appeal against her convictions, court told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Decisions on the matters referred for potential contempt have not yet been finalised,” an OPP spokesperson said. The OPP had previously declined to comment on the referrals.</p> <p>The director of public prosecutions is also considering whether to appeal against the sentence handed down to Patterson, the spokesperson said.</p> <p>Such appeals are rare, but can occur if the DPP considers a sentence to be manifestly inadequate.</p> <p>On 8 September, Patterson was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/08/erin-patterson-sentence-australia-mushroom-murder-ntwnfb">sentenced to life imprisonment</a> with a non-parole period of 33 years for the murders of Don and Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson, and the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson.</p> <p>The deadline for a DPP appeal relating to Patterson’s sentence is Monday, a shorter timeframe than the defence is allowed to appeal under new guidelines being trialled by the Victorian supreme court.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Neither ARN Media, the owner of the station Kiis FM that broadcasts The Kyle and Jackie O Show, nor the producer of the serial killers event, responded to previous requests for comment.</p> <p>Separately, it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/01/kyle-jackie-o-show-kiis-radio-licence-vulgar-deeply-offensive-content">revealed this week</a> that the Australian Communications and Media Authority was considering taking enforcement action against the Kiis network as The Kyle and Jackie O Show repeatedly aired “vulgar, sexually explicit and deeply offensive” content despite multiple warnings.</p> <p>In the Patterson case, Beale told the Victorian supreme court on 16 June in the absence of the jury: “This morning the presenters of the Kyle and Jackie O radio show commented on this case during a news segment on their show.</p> <p>“I have read a transcript of that commentary. I encourage all commentators to engage their brains before they open their mouths, as they may otherwise land themselves and their organisations in hot water. I will be referring this morning’s matter to the Office of Public Prosecutions for contempt proceedings.”</p> <p>Guardian Australia reviewed a podcast of the show, which was available online on the afternoon Beale made his comments.</p> <p>In the podcast, Sandilands said after a news item about the trial, which erroneously said the jury was expected to retire to consider its verdict that week, “Is this big lump still getting around, this big lump … miserable looking thing.</p> <p>“Did she do it or what?”</p> <p>His co-host, Jackie Henderson, asked soon after: “I mean, my question is: how strong is her case.”</p> <p>“Not strong, not strong for her,” Sandilands responded.</p> <p>The pair, and a newsreader, continued to discuss the case, including mobile phone tower evidence, and Sandilands incorrectly said: “Hasn’t she done something like this before, with the mushrooms?”</p> <p>Sandilands went on to say: “But the rest of us already know, yeah, you fuck … come on, bro. You can tell by looking at her, just lock that bitch up.”</p> <p>Henderson could be heard laughing while Sandilands spoke about the case, before he said: “Takes too long. Court should be in and out, decided and moved on.”</p> <p>Henderson then said: “Well, until it’s your turn one day, where you’re accused, right?”</p> <p>“What am I going to get accused of?” Sandilands responded.</p> <p>On Thursday, lawyers for Patterson told the court she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/02/mushroom-murderer-erin-patterson-will-appeal-her-convictions-court-told-ntwnfb">would appeal against her conviction</a>.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
