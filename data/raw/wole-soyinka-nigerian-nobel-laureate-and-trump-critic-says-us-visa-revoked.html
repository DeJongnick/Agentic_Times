<p>The Trump administration has revoked the visa for Wole Soyinka, the acclaimed Nigerian Nobel prize-winning writer who has been critical of Trump since his first presidency, Soyinka revealed on Tuesday.</p> <p>“I want to assure the consulate … that I’m very content with the revocation of my visa,” Soyinka, who won the 1986 Nobel prize for literature, told a news conference.</p> <p>Soyinka previously held permanent residency in the United States, though he destroyed his green card after Donald Trump’s first election in 2016.</p> <p>Soyinka speculated that his recent comments comparing Trump to the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin might have struck a nerve and contributed to the US consulate’s decision.</p> <p>Soyinka said earlier this year that the US consulate in Lagos had called him in for an interview to reassess his visa, which he said he would not attend.</p> <p>According to a letter from the consulate addressed to Soyinka, seen by Agence France-Presse, officials have cancelled his visa, citing US state department regulations that allow “a consular officer, the secretary, or a department official to whom the secretary has delegated this authority … to revoke a nonimmigrant visa at any time, in his or her discretion”.</p> <p>Reading the letter aloud to journalists in Lagos, Nigeria’s economic centre, he jokingly called it a “rather curious love letter from an embassy”, while telling any organisations hoping to invite him to the United States “not to waste their time”.</p> <p>“I have no visa. I am banned,” Soyinka said.</p> <p>The US embassy in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, said it could not comment on individual cases, citing confidentiality rules.</p> <p>The Trump administration has made visa revocations a hallmark of its wider crackdown on immigration, notably targeting university students who were outspoken about Palestinian rights.</p> <p>Soyinka said he had recently compared Trump to Uganda’s Amin, something he said Trump “should be proud of”.</p> <p>“Idi Amin was a man of international stature, a statesman, so when I called Donald Trump Idi Amin, I thought I was paying him a compliment,” Soyinka said. “He’s been behaving like a dictator.”</p> <p>The 91-year-old playwright behind Death and the King’s Horseman has taught at and been awarded honours from top US universities including Harvard and Cornell.</p> <p>His latest novel, Chronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth, a satire about corruption in Nigeria, was published in 2021. Soyinka described the book as his “gift to Nigeria” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/25/wole-soyinka-this-book-is-my-gift-to-nigeria">in an interiview</a> with the Guardian.</p> <p>In February, the Crucible theatre in Sheffield <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jan/07/wole-soyinka-death-and-the-kings-horseman-crucible-sheffield">staged Death and the King’s Horseman.</a></p> <p>Soyinka left the door open to accepting an invitation to the United States should circumstances change, but added: “I wouldn’t take the initiative myself because there’s nothing I’m looking for there. Nothing.”</p> <p>He went on to criticise the ramped-up arrests of undocumented immigrants in the country.</p> <p>“This is not about me,” Soyinka said. “When we see people being picked off the street – people being hauled up and they disappear for a month … old women, children being separated. So that’s really what concerns me.”</p> <p>Trump’s crackdown has seen national guard troops deployed to US cities and citizens temporarily detained as part of aggressive raids, as well as the curtailing of legal means of entry.</p>
