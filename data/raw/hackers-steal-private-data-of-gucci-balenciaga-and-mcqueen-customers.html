<p>Hackers have stolen data from customers of the luxury fashion group Kering, whose brands include Gucci, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen.</p> <p>Cyber-attackers have stolen data of potentially millions of customers, including the names, phone numbers and email addresses of customers of the fashion group, it has emerged.</p> <p>Paris-based Kering said the breach happened in June and that no financial information – such as bank account numbers, credit card information, or government-issued identification numbers – was taken.</p> <p>The attackers have been identified as a ransom-seeking group, Shiny Hunters.</p> <p>Kering said on Monday: “In June 2025, we identified that an unauthorised third party gained temporary access to our systems and accessed limited customer data from some of our [fashion] houses.</p> <p>“Our houses immediately disclosed the breach to the relevant authorities and notified customers according to local regulations.”</p> <p>“The breach was promptly identified, and appropriate actions have been taken to secure the affected systems and prevent such incidents in the future,” the company added, without naming which brands had been affected.</p> <p>According to one website tracking hacks, <a href="http://datbreaches.net">DataBreaches.net</a>, Shiny Hunters this last month posted samples of the data breach on Telegram channels showing names, email addresses and dates of birth of some Gucci customers.</p> <p>The BBC, which first reported Kering’s confirmation of the breach, said samples of the details showed how much some of the customers were spending in stores – in some cases up to $86,000 (£63,000). Shiny Hunters told the BBC it breached the brands in April.</p> <p>In July, another luxury brand, Louis Vuitton, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/11/louis-vuitton-uk-customer-data-stolen-cyber-attack">said it had been targeted by hackers</a> who had taken customer data. The attacks follow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/cybercrime">serious breaches</a> of British companies including M&amp;S, the Co-op and Harrods.</p> <p>Production remains halted at Jaguar Land Rover car factories for the third week after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/jaguar-land-rover">a cyber-attack forced it to shut down its computer systems</a>.</p>
