<p>GPs in New South Wales will be among the first in Australia to diagnose and provide medication for children and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the state government has announced.</p> <p>Currently, most people seeking a diagnosis, management and ongoing prescription medication for ADHD must see a specialist – often a paediatrician for children or a psychiatrist for adults.</p> <p>That creates difficulties, critics have said, due to the high costs and long wait lists involved, especially in regional areas. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/19/adhd-medicine-australia-gp-prescriptions">Suzanne drives eight hours to get ADHD medicine from a specialist. Australian GPs say they need more prescribing powers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NSW reforms should help people like mid-north coast mother Suzanne Grobke, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/19/adhd-medicine-australia-gp-prescriptions">who told the Guardian in March</a> that she was making an eight-hour round-trip to visit a Sydney paediatrician every three months to access ADHD medicine for her 12-year-old daughter.</p> <p>The government announced on Monday it would enable up to 1,000 general practitioners to provide ongoing ADHD prescriptions for children and adults on stable doses of medication. Up to 100 GPs would be enabled to diagnose and initiate medication where appropriate.</p> <p>The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said “by safely training more GPs to treat and diagnose ADHD, we are hoping to break the cycle of people having to wait years for what can be a life-altering diagnosis”.</p> <p>The move was welcomed by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP). The college’s NSW chair,<strong> </strong>Dr Rebekah Hoffman, said: “This announcement will have life-changing impacts when it comes to accessing timely and affordable ADHD care for families across the state.”</p> <p>Hoffman said she had heard of families in rural areas travelling more than seven hours to see a paediatrician, and families in Sydney spending more than $5,000 on assessments and diagnosis for ADHD.”</p> <p>“We know when it comes to ADHD that early intervention is vital, and being able to access appropriate therapy and medications from a young age helps kids thrive at school and at home,” she said.</p> <p>The state government would seek expressions of interest from GPs to undertake additional education and training funded by NSW Health in the coming months.</p> <p>The reforms would be staged, prioritising prescriptions for children because of the significant impact any delay can have on a child’s development. Ongoing prescriptions for children were expected from early 2026.</p> <p>In Queensland, GPs have been able to diagnose and prescribe ADHD medicine for children but not adults since 2017. <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-14/wa-labor-election-promise-gps-in-adhd-care/104937644">Western Australia committed in February</a> to reforms allowing GPs to diagnose and prescribe stimulant medication for ADHD for patients over 10 years of age.</p> <p>The WA chair of RACGP, Dr Ramya Raman, said GPs in the state would “soon” begin a structured college educational program with 13 hours of online modules and complete workshops led by non-GP specialists.</p> <p>A 2023 Senate inquiry into ADHD in Australia recommended nationally consistent rules for ADHD medication prescriptions. The proposal was supported by the federal government, but it is yet to commit to national reforms.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Matilda Boseley</em></p>
