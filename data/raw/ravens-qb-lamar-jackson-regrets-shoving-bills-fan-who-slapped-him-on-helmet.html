<p>Lamar Jackson has admitted he should have held his feelings in check after he shoved a fan who slapped him during his team’s loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday night.</p> <p>The Baltimore Ravens quarterback was celebrating a touchdown in front of the home crowd in Buffalo when a fan in a Bills jersey slapped Jackson and teammate DeAndre Hopkins on their helmets. Jackson shoved the fan, who was ejected from the stadium. <a href="https://x.com/AdamSchefter/status/1965112979223183451">ESPN later reported</a> that the fan has been banned from all NFL stadiums. </p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/MySportsUpdate/status/1964881369949217111">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A fan hit/shoved Lamar Jackson in the head — and Lamar Jackson put him in his seat.  <a href="https://t.co/CpqvgrQmrV">pic.twitter.com/CpqvgrQmrV</a></p>&mdash; Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) <a href="https://twitter.com/MySportsUpdate/status/1964881369949217111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2025</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>“He slapped me, and he was talking – so, I just forgot where I was for a little bit,” Jackson said after the game, which the Ravens <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/07/nfl-round-up-week-one-scores">lost 41-40 in the final seconds</a>. “You have to think in those situations. You have security out there; let security handle it. But I just let my emotions get the best of me. Hopefully, it doesn’t happen again. I learned from that.”</p> <p>Jackson, a two-time NFL MVP, said he enjoys interacting with fans and plans to continue doing so.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/08/aaron-rodgerss-jets-revenge-tour-shows-the-old-guy-may-still-have-it">Aaron Rodgers’ Jets revenge tour shows the old guy may still have it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’ve never seen our fans do that,” Jackson said. “So, I’ll probably do it again when we score a touchdown. It’s not nothing against the fans. I’m just celebrating when my teammates get a touchdown.”</p> <p>Jackson had an excellent game against the Bills, one of the Ravens’ long-time rivals in the AFC. He threw for 209 yards and two touchdowns, and rushed for another. His touchdown pass to Hopkins put the Ravens up 34-19 with 1:09 left in the third quarter but the Bills scored 16 points in the final four minutes to seal a thrilling victory.</p>
