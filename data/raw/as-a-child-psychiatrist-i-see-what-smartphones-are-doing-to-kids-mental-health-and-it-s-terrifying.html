<h1>As a child psychiatrist, I see what smartphones are doing to kids’ mental health – and it’s terrifying</h1>

<p>Smartphone use among children has reached a critical moment. Many of us in the UK are increasingly aware of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/17/children-swiped-channel-4-smartphones-mental-health-addiction">dangers associated with them</a> – and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist, I am more worried than most. I am witnessing at first hand the sheer devastation that smartphone use is wreaking on our young people’s mental health. The majority of children over 10 I see at my NHS clinic now have a smartphone. An increasingly large proportion of patients have difficulties that are related to, or exacerbated by, their use of technology.</p> <p>We are seeing profound mental illness stemming from excessive social media use, online bullying, screen addiction, or falling prey to online child sexual exploitation. We are seeing children who are disappearing into online worlds, who are unable to sleep, who are increasingly inattentive and impulsive, emotionally dysregulated and aggressive. Children crippled by anxiety or a fear of missing out. Who spend hours alone, cut off from those who love them, who spend hour upon hour speaking to strangers.</p> <p>Children and adolescents are increasingly seeking comfort and validation from peer groups online. Unfortunately, some of these encourage self-harm, eating disorder behaviours and even suicide. I looked after a young person last year who struggled significantly with their mental health and prolific self-harm. I was later informed that they were uploading their experience and behaviours on TikTok and had livestreamed content from within A&amp;E departments and an inpatient psychiatric ward to thousands of followers and well-wishers.</p> <p>Children’s self-esteem and self-image is also at an all-time low, and levels of depression and suicidal thoughts have never been higher. It is no secret among mental health professionals that there is a direct link between smartphone use and real-world harms.</p> <p>The average UK 12-year-old now <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5804/cmselect/cmeduc/118/report.html">spends 29 hours a week</a> – equivalent to a part-time job – on their smartphone. To have access to the amount of information they do at such a young age is having a profound impact on their neurological development. Where in the past we might have received a handful of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) referrals each week, we are now inundated. Parents can’t get their children to sleep or sit still. They struggle to concentrate in school and education has taken an all-time hit. As adults, we see how our attention span has been affected in the years since our lives have gone online. I can’t remember the last time I saw someone watch a film without scrolling through their phone or checking their messages. Our brains are changing – and children are not immune to this.</p> <p>At the same time, our young people are increasingly isolated and insular. The average time that teens spend with friends each day has plummeted by 65% since 2010. For hundreds of years, adolescence has triggered a period of social “pack mentality”. Historically, that might have meant pressure to join a football team or go out with friends. But now, this socialising is happening more and more on WhatsApp groups and social media – with terrifying consequences.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/17/children-swiped-channel-4-smartphones-mental-health-addiction">If you’ve got children, you need to watch Swiped – and see how sick their phones are making them | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In these closed spaces, free from adult oversight, children can fall down disturbing rabbit holes. In clinic, we hear about viral suicide pacts and self-harm challenges being shared by children as young as 10. For very vulnerable children, who may not have many friends in the classroom, the lure of being accepted online can feel intoxicating, even if it means participating in something hugely dangerous. In recent years, there have been numerous high-profile cases of child suicides linked to social media. Most striking is that often their parents have no insight into what is happening before tragedy occurs.</p> <p>This needs to be a watershed moment. As an advocate for children’s mental health, it is clear to me that we are forcing children to grow up long before they are ready. My heart sinks whenever I encounter yet another young person in clinic feeling hopeless about their future, who is deeply embedded in an alternate reality created by their phone.</p> <p>In my own family, I hope I’ll be able to keep my children away from smartphones and social media until they are at least 16. Our brains continue to develop up until the age of about 25, and prior to that our ability to think rationally, make decisions based on fact rather than emotion, plan, problem-solve and exhibit self-control is limited. Countless adults struggle to mediate their phone use and maintain productivity, make impulsive purchases online and fall for the many scams out there – why are we expecting our children to cope?</p> <p>But I’m aware how difficult this will be if all their friends have access to one. That’s why it’s not enough for parents to have to make individual choices. As a society, we urgently need to reckon with this problem. Campaigns such as <a href="https://smartphonefreechildhood.co.uk/">Smartphone Free Childhood</a> are gaining momentum in encouraging parents to take decisions en masse for their children’s wellbeing. But the state must now also intervene. I hope the government wakes up to what is happening to our young people and takes these tough decisions out of our hands.</p> <p><em>As told to Lucy Pasha-Robinson</em></p> <ul> <li><p>Dr Emily Sehmer is a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist in the NHS (and mother of two children)</p></li> <li><p><em>In the UK, the youth suicide charity <a href="https://www.papyrus-uk.org/">Papyrus</a> can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or email <a href="mailto:pat@papyrus-uk.org">pat@papyrus-uk.org</a>, and in the UK and Ireland <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.ie">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.
