<p>Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin lavished praise on each other but offered no details of their nearly three-hour meeting in Alaska on Friday, with the US president saying “great progress” but no deal had been made on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p> <p>“There’s no deal until there’s a deal. I will call up Nato … I’ll of course call up [Ukraine’s] President Zelenskyy and tell him about today’s meeting,” he said.</p> <p>Putin, speaking through an interpreter, described Trump’s efforts on Ukraine as “precious” and suggested the two leaders had hammered out “an understanding”. He urged Europe to “not throw a wrench in the works” and “not use backroom dealings” to torpedo it.</p> <p>As the press conference ended, Putin suggested their next meeting might take place in Moscow and dozens of reporters shouted questions in vain. The US president, who can typically never resist a free-wheeling press conference, left the stage without answering any of them.</p> <p>Here are the key <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics">US politics</a> stories at a glance:</p>  <h2>No deal after brief Trump-Putin talks on Ukraine in Alaska</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> left more questions than answers on Friday as he claimed “great progress” in his high-stakes summit with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, but said that no deal had been reached to end Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p> <p>“I believe we had a very productive meeting,” the US president said at a joint press conference in Anchorage, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska">Alaska</a>. “There were many, many points that we agreed on.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/15/trump-putin-alaska-meeting-ukraine"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Washington DC and White House agree to scale back Trump ‘takeover’ of city police</h2>  <p>White House officials and attorneys for Washington DC have agreed to scale back the Trump administration’s takeover of the city’s police department.</p> <p>Under an agreement announced early Friday evening, the US capital city’s metropolitan police department will remain under the control of its chief, Pamela Smith, instead of Terry Cole, the top administrator for the Drug and Enforcement Administration, <a href="https://x.com/JoeKhalilTV/status/1956458741319999497">according</a> to <a href="https://www.dcnewsnow.com/news/local-news/washington-dc/dc-takeover/trump-adminstration-dc-lawyers-agree-to-scale-back-bondi-executive-order/">reports</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/15/trump-dc-police-chief-dea"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump says Xi told him China will not invade Taiwan while he is in office</h2>  <p>The US president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, has said that his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, told him China would not invade Taiwan while Trump is in office.</p> <p>“He told me, ‘I will never do it as long as you’re president’.
