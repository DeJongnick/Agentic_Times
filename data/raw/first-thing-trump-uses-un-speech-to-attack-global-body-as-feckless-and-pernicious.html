<h1>First Thing: Trump uses UN speech to attack global body as feckless and pernicious</h1>
<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-09-24T11:33:46Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Jem Bartholomew &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> US news</div>
<p>Good morning.</p> 
<p>Donald Trump took the stage at the United Nations general assembly hall for the first time in six years to launch <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/trump-un-general-assembly-speech">a full-on assault on the world body</a>, which he described as a feckless, corrupt and pernicious global force that should follow the example of his own leadership.</p> 
<p>In an inflammatory speech on the 80th anniversary of the founding of the UN, Trump called for countries to close their borders and expel foreigners, accused the world body of leading a “globalist migration agenda”, and telling national leaders that the UN was “funding an assault on your countries”.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What did Trump say? </strong>He appealed to European leaders to embrace a blood-and-soil nationalism and follow his example. “It’s time to end the failed experiment of open borders,” he urged. “You have to end it now … Your countries are going to hell.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>What is the significance of the address?</strong> Those who support the values of the UN must realize “the degree to which the world’s superpower seems bent on the destruction of everything they believe”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/trump-un-general-assembly-speech-analysis">writes Patrick Wintour</a>, the Guardian’s diplomatic editor. The speech urgently prompts the question of “how the world will operate in the absence of reliable American leadership”.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<h2><strong>Trump says he believes Ukraine can regain all land lost to Russia since 2022 invasion</strong></h2> 
<p>Donald Trump has said he believes Ukraine can regain all the land it has lost since the 2022 Russian invasion, in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/trump-ukraine-land-lost-russia-nato-oil-imports-un-speech">one of his strongest statements of support</a> to Kyiv.</p> 
<p>The president gave his upbeat assessment by claiming Russia was in big economic trouble in a post on Truth Social after meeting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in New York. Zelenskyy hailed Trump’s intervention.</p> 
<p>Earlier, Trump said that he planned to enforce his demand that Nato countries stop importing Russian oil – including Hungary, led by his close ally Viktor Orbán.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What is the latest in the Russia-Ukraine war?</strong> Russia is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-says-trump-can-change-xi-jinpings-stance-on-russias-war">launching long-range drones</a> into Nato countries’ airspace to test the military alliance’s air defences and search for weak points, Zelenskyy said Tuesday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>How serious is the risk of escalation? </strong>The first step of any further escalation would be new Russian incursions. That could happen “if the Russians think it may cause disruption or sow discord in Nato”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/wednesday-briefing-what-russia-wants-with-nato-airspace-and-what-options-it-leaves-the-west">says David Jordan</a>, of the Freeman Air and Space Institute at King’s College London.</p></li>

<p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to air on Tuesday night, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/24/jimmy-kimmel-says-trump-tried-his-best-to-cancel-him-as-his-show-returns-to-air-after-suspension">calling government threats to silence comedians “anti-American”</a>, as he broke his silence about his suspension from ABC which ignited a national debate over free speech and outcry over the bullying tactics of the Trump administration.</p> 
<p>“This show is not important,” Kimmel said during his first monologue since Disney, which owns ABC, suspended his late-night show from the network last week under pressure from Trump officials over his comments on the shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. “What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.”</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>How was Disney </strong><strong>persuaded to reverse the decision?</strong> Unions, rights organizations, first amendment defenders and protesters stood by Kimmel. On Monday, for instance, the American Civil Liberties Union released an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/hollywood-aclu-letter-jimmy-kimmel-suspension">open letter</a> signed by more than 400 Hollywood stars condemning this “dark moment for freedom of speech”.</p></li>
