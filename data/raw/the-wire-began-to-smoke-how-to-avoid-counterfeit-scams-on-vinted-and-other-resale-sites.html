<p>When Maheen found a brand-new Dyson Airwrap for the bargain price of £260 on the resale website Vinted, she was thrilled. The seller’s reviews were all five-star, and she trusted in the buyer-protection policy should something go wrong.</p> <p>Sold new, an Airwrap costs between £400 and £480, but Maheen did not suspect anything was amiss. “I had used Vinted many times and it was simple and straightforward. Nothing had ever gone wrong,” she says.</p> <p>However, after two weeks – and about four uses – she spotted a problem. “I noticed the wire began to smoke and the product seemed unsafe,” she says. Maheen contacted Dyson and was told to send in the Airwrap.</p> <p>Its response confirmed her fears. “I got a letter from [Dyson] confirming the product was counterfeit. It was unsafe and they wouldn’t return it to me,” she says.</p> <p>Maheen’s experience is far from unique. Almost two-fifths (37%) of Britons have been scammed while buying or selling on online marketplaces such as Facebook Marketplace, eBay and Vinted, according to research from the credit reference agency Experian.</p> <p>Victims of this type of crime tend to skew younger, with more than half of gen Z (58%) telling researchers they had been scammed compared with just 16% of people over the age of 55.</p> <p>For almost a quarter of people losses were in the region of £51 to £100, while 13% had lost more than £250. A small number said the scam had cost them between £501 and £1,000.</p> <p>The most common type of scam respondents encountered – being sent fake or counterfeit products (34%) – is the one Maheen fell prey to. Next up was requests to pay off-platform (31%), and items never arriving after payment (22%).</p> <h2>What the scam looks like</h2> <p>It looks like the legitimate item and the description suggests it is – more than half of scam victims (51%) told Experian they only realised they had been scammed once their item was delivered and turned out to be fake, or failed to arrive.</p> <p>Photos may be low resolution or look too good – like a catalogue photo – because they have been taken from other websites.</p> <p>The price will be less than you would expect and if you start asking questions the seller may try to rush you into a purchase and may ask you to pay them outside the Vinted platform.</p> <h2>What to do</h2> <p>Always review a seller’s profile closely and read customer reviews before purchasing an item on a marketplace. Try to obtain as much information about the product as possible before buying – for instance, ask the seller to send a video of the product. To protect yourself, stick to secure payment methods and avoid bank transfers.</p> <p>If the worst happens, report the incident to the marketplace and ask for a refund. They may ask for screenshots of messages and the details of the seller or buyer, plus any bank transfer details.</p> <p>Maheen was outside the Vinted two-day buyer protection window, but assumed she would get her money back because the product was dangerous. However, she found that it “was really hard to talk to someone”.</p> <p>She says: “It felt like I was talking to a bot.”</p> <p>With Guardian Money’s help, she has now got her money back.</p> <p>A Vinted spokesperson said: “The vast majority of transactions on Vinted take place without issue, and our teams work hard to ensure a smooth trading experience for all our Vinted members.</p> <p>“When a dispute does occur between a buyer and a seller, we will mediate, working closely with our delivery partners and potentially asking for additional information or evidence, before issuing a final decision.”</p> <p>If appealing to the marketplace directly goes nowhere, there are other things you can do.</p> <p>If you used a debit card ask your bank to make a chargeback claim. Alternatively, if you paid by credit card, try a section 75 claim – this is only an option if you have spent more than £100. If you paid by bank transfer it is more complicated, but you may be entitled to a refund under new <a href="https://www.psr.org.uk/information-for-consumers/app-fraud-reimbursement-protections/">fraud refund protections</a>.</p>
