<p>New Brexit border checks are reducing consumer choice and compromising Britain’s food security, according to fresh produce sellers and plant growers.</p> <p>A joint letter from the Fresh Produce Consortium (FPC) and the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) has called for an urgent meeting with the government over the continued problems their members face when importing plants and cut flowers under the current border system.</p> <p>The letter, from the HTA, which represents garden retailers and growers, and the FPC, which represents 700 fresh produce suppliers and distributors, comes six months after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/27/three-and-a-bit-years-after-brexit-are-border-checks-finally-here">new post-Brexit border checks</a> on plant and animal products coming into the country from EU countries were introduced.</p> <p>From 30 April this year, plants for planting and some cut flowers coming into Britain from the EU became subject to checks at border control posts across Britain.</p> <p>Before this, plants were inspected at their point of destination, meaning nurseries and growers could store them in controlled environments on site.</p> <p>The border changes, brought in to mirror the checks on British exports going into Europe, were intended to improve Britain’s biosecurity and prevent the spread of disease between plants in the country.</p> <p>However, in their letter the two groups said trade in edible plants, such as fresh fruit and vegetables, and non-edibles including finished plants, bulbs and seeds, had seen “significant challenges”, with importers facing rising costs, increased risk of delays or damage to orders, as well as cumbersome paperwork.</p> <p>It added: “This situation has led to reduced consumer choice, strained business relationships, a tarnished UK business reputation, diminished confidence in border processes, compromised food security, and setbacks in achieving our environmental targets.”</p> <p>Jon Adams, the owner of Hertfordshire-based plant wholesaler Jane Adams, said he had stopped importing olive trees into Britain due to the new border regime, while lavender imports were also much more difficult to import due to the level of checks.</p> <p>Adams, whose company has been importing plants and cut flowers for more than 50 years, said the rules had added about 10% on the costs of deliveries, while orders had been hit with delays sometimes lasting between seven and 24 hours.</p> <p>Another large retailer, who did not want to be named, said: “Due to border concerns and other pressures on businesses in the environmental horticulture sector, we are seeing the choice of plant products imported being reduced by up to 25% in some cases in the last two years.”</p> <p>UK growers of fruit and vegetables also rely on imports from the EU, with many buying seeds and young plants from the continent that are then grown in the UK to produce food.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the National Farmers’ Union warned that growers faced an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/13/brexit-delays-to-seed-imports-could-hit-crop-production-say-growers">“existential threat” from the checks</a>, warning that young plants could face long delays and may be damaged or destroyed – which could hit future yields.</p> <p>The British Tomato Growers’ Association said in August that lengthy checks of seeds at the border were threatening yields, while the Cucumber and Pepper Growers’ Association (CPGA) said the significant holdups were causing “costly crop delays”.</p> <p>Nigel Jenney, the chief executive of the Fresh Produce Consortium, said this could have a big impact on food security and domestic growers’ ability to produce the same level of food.</p> <p>He said: “UK production [of fruit and vegetables] depends on efficiently and effectively being able to import plants that are uncompromised at the UK border, and the UK glasshouse industry – and particularly the tomato industry – is extremely concerned about the border strategy and the risk of cross-contaminating products.”</p> <p>The letter also set out 10 immediate actions from the government that could improve the flow of goods from the EU to Britain, while also protecting businesses from increased costs.</p> <p>These included agreeing a plant health agreement with the EU based on mutual recognition of standards, removing barriers in the current border control post system that stop inspectors carrying out checks after 5pm, while also calling for inspections to meet the agreed four-hour service level agreement set by the government.</p> <p>It has also called for the removal of the £145 common user charge (CUC) fee at the government-run border control post in Sevington, Kent, which processes all checks coming through the Port of Dover and Channel tunnel.</p> <p>The letter says the charge should be halted for 12 months while a review of the economic impacts of the border policy is carried out.</p> <p>A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Protecting UK biosecurity remains one of our key priorities and checks on certain imports are essential to prevent outbreaks of diseases that would severely damage our food supply, the environment and future trade.</p> <p>“Since coming into power, ministers are working closely with industry, trade partners and enforcement agencies to minimise disruption. This includes resetting our relationship with Europe and seeing a new veterinary agreement to improve our trade ties.”</p>
