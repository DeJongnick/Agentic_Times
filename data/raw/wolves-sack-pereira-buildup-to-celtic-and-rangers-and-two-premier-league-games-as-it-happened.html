Forty-five have come from corners – 18.7%. Were that proportion to be maintained over the season it would present a remarkable leap on the high of 14.2% from 2010-11. The reality is there’s likely to be a regression to the mean: if a glance at the proportion of goals scored from corners shows anything, it’s that there really isn’t much of a pattern at all. The proportion hovered at 11 or 12% most years to 2009, since when it has been at 13-14% – a trend which, if anything, goes against the assumption that everybody stopped taking corners seriously in the peak years of guardiolismo only to rediscover their love of a booming inswinger last season (when, in fact, the proportion of goals from corners fell to its lowest level since 2013-14).</p> <p><em>Read Jonathan Wilson’s latest column:</em></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/01/premier-league-has-turned-a-tactical-corner-but-set-play-trend-will-surely-fade">Premier League has turned a tactical corner but set-play trend will surely fade | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-690742678f081a1dc7fc005b" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-02T11:38:07.692Z">11.38am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Comments like this</strong> are why Guardian live blogs are the best live blogs.

It is a major pet peeve of mine to see players express self-belief and then immediately get lambasted for being arrogant, self-absorbed, disrespectful etc, when it is that very same self-belief we <i>expect</i> them to manifest as part of becoming some of the greatest athletes in the world. We create these conditions (thumping Hans Zimmer-style music, flame jets and fireworks, ominous lighting, jump cut-filled ads, managers screaming at them from the touchline) where they're under immense pressure to be better than each other and constantly "on it" all the time, but heaven forbid they verbalise that confidence in any way. And bear in mind that elements of the media often frame their questioning in a way to tease out such sentiments from them, such that they have to express that self-belief in a manner that makes it sound arrogant.</p><p>I think back to players like Bendtner, Ibrahimovic and Ronaldo, and things they've said over time (though in Ibrahimovic's case, to be fair, he did play it up a little for the pantomime value), and not only is that image held against them for the duration of their careers and beyond, people seem to actually take <i>glee</i> in them not fulfilling their own ambitions. Bendtner is still a figure of fun on some corners of the Internet just for not becoming, as he had hoped (and I am sure every player hopes), the best striker in the world. People actually take pleasure in someone failing in their ambitions to be good at what they do. Ignoring the fact that anyone who gets anywhere near this level is already the 1 of 1 of 1% of anybody who's ever attempted it.</p><p>We can't just hope to see, from our privileged positions, athletes fulfilling their hopes to be the best they can be; we have to yearn to see them fail, convinced they deserve to because it's "arrogance". It's perverse. Now imagine for a goalkeeper, who has to compete for a position only one player can play at a time and one player can nail down for two decades, what kind of self-belief is required in order to even want to <i>pursue</i> that position in the first place, and what feeling of vindication you must feel if and when you get into that position. By the stupid standards we create, all goalkeepers are arrogant. And god bless them for it.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6907411f8f08e3e3851d1f53" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-02T11:36:49.636Z">11.36am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>This has struck me</strong> in the early part of the season.

Watching the full 90 minutes of Chelsea’s narrow but still comfortable 1-0 defeat of Tottenham was like staring at one of those hypnotic drunken city centre brawls that appear on social media from time to time, where nothing ever really seems to start or stop, where the whole thing is just a kind of tortured flailing, but one that must also be pored over endlessly in the comments.</p> <p>A man in a red hoodie is doing air kung fu kicks. Haymakers are being thrown at no one in particular. Someone falls through a fire door. Yellow-jacketed man tries to break it up, wanders off, comes back waving a bin lid.

And fitting in a poor Spurs performance that it should be Xavi Simons who made the vital mistake.

Mohamed Salah scored his 250th Liverpool goal in the 2-0 win.</p> <p>Afterwards Slot hailed his “unbelievable” forward, who had opened the scoring in a deserved defeat of Unai Emery’s in-form team after a calamitous error by the World Cup-winning goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez. Salah’s strike capped a vastly improved performance from the Egypt international.</p> <p>“It’s huge,” Slot said of Salah’s latest Liverpool milestone. “It is almost unbelievable if you score 250 goals, let alone 250 goals for one club. You don’t see that much in football any more. Apart from the goal he had a very good performance. When we had to play long, we mainly played to him and he held the ball and the team could come to him. What I liked was that he also helped the team defensively as well.
