<p>As health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr has repeatedly <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1844904723977207912">blamed</a> industrially manufactured food products for the country’s chronic illness and obesity crises, and urged Americans to limit their consumption of foods with added sugar, salt, fat, dyes and preservatives.</p> <p>Amid a slew of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/11/covid-vaccine-boosters-rfk">controversial</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/trump-rfk-autism-tylenol-backlash">unbacked public health claims</a>, his stance on ultra-processed foods is one of his least polarizing. More than 65% of Americans say they are in favor of reforming processed foods to remove added sugars and added dyes, according to a January Associated Press and National Opinion Research Center <a href="https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/January-2025-Cabinet-topline-v2.pdf">poll</a>.</p> <p>Yet while RFK Jr touts the importance of eliminating ultra-processed foods from the US diet, nutrition experts say several of the Trump administration policies, including <a href="https://www.foodandpower.net/latest/obbb-farm-subsidies-snap-jul-25">massive subsidies to corn and soy farms</a>, undermine that goal.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/08/ultra-processed-foods-environment-impact">The hidden cost of ultra-processed foods on the environment: ‘The whole industry should pay’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Maha leadership is really failing on their promise to fight chronic disease, and they’re betraying the members of the public who put their trust in them to address this very real problem that Americans are really concerned about,” said Aviva Musicus, an assistant professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.</p> <p>In September, Kennedy’s health and human services department released the “Make America Healthy Again” strategy <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/maha-commission-report-childhood-disease-strategy.html">report</a>, billing it as a roadmap to improve children’s health. The report named highly processed foods as a leading driver behind the rising rates of chronic disease in children and outlined more than 120 recommendations, including educational campaigns to promote new, forthcoming dietary guidelines; advancing policies to restrict food dye additives; and potential revisions to nutrition information rule-making.</p> <p>The report has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/09/white-house-maha-childrens-health-report">criticized</a> by nutrition and public health experts, however, for its focus on voluntary action over meaningful regulation of food and chemical companies. It suggests tracking Americans’ exposure to chemicals and pesticides, but does not impose any limitations on pesticide use, for example. Despite poor diet being named as a harm to children’s health, it does not suggest regulating the majority of additives in ultra-processed foods (UPFs).</p> <p>It instead proposes developing a government-wide definition to “support potential future research and policy activity”. The plan also recommends the exploration of “potential industry guidelines”, to limit the marketing of unhealthy food to children. Some advocates say that the report’s goals <a href="https://www.cspi.org/cspi-news/maha-report-calls-fighting-chronic-disease-trump-and-kennedy-have-yanked-funding">clash</a> with the Trump administration’s cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), Medicaid and scientific funding, all of which are essential to public health.</p> <p>“When it comes to food, Maha doesn’t seem particularly interested in regulation, despite talking about the need to protect consumers from industry influence and the harms the industry is creating,” Musicus said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote in a statement to the Guardian: “The MAHA Strategy is a comprehensive plan with more than 120 initiatives designed to reverse the failed policies that have fueled America’s childhood chronic disease epidemic. It represents the most ambitious reform agenda in modern history – realigning our food and health systems, transforming education, and unleashing science to safeguard America’s children and families.”</p> <p>She added: “HHS is committed to serving the American people, not special interests, by delivering radical transparency and upholding gold-standard science.”</p> <p>Ultra-processed foods are industrially altered food products that include processed additives to improve taste, convenience and shelf life. Making up as much as 73% of the US food supply, UPFs have been linked to a number of <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310">health risks</a> including <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36932667/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cardiovascular disease</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39848440/">type 2 diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.aicr.org/resources/blog/ultra-processed-foods-and-cancer-whats-the-connection/">cancer,</a> <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11901572/">digestive and microbiome issues</a>, and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2809727">adverse mental health</a>. </p> <p>Many of the additives in UPFs, such as high-fructose corn syrup, corn starch, dextrose, soy lecithin and maltodextrin, are derivatives of corn and soy, two commodity crops that receive millions in agricultural subsidies. Trump’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text">reconciliation bill</a>, signed into law in July, increases spending on these subsidies by <a href="https://www.ewg.org/research/triple-dipping-budget-bill-raises-farm-subsidies-wealthy-farmers-billions-dollars">$52bn</a> over the next 10 years, according to an <a href="https://www.ewg.org/research/triple-dipping-budget-bill-raises-farm-subsidies-wealthy-farmers-billions-dollars">analysis</a> by the Environmental Working Group. (Subsidy payments increased even as programs like Snap, which in 2024 provided food and nutrition assistance to <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-closer-look-at-who-benefits-from-snap-state-by-state-fact-sheets#Alabama">41 million Americans</a>, faced significant cuts.)</p> <p>Subsidies for corn and soy “have definitely contributed”, to the proliferation of UPFs, said Ben Lilliston, the director of rural strategies and climate change at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. The consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, for example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15051594/">increased 1,000%</a> between 1970 and 1990.</p> <p>“Our farm policy is designed for farmers to overproduce corn and soy, and encourage them to do that,” Lilliston said. Decades of huge subsidies for commodity crops led to an excess amount of corn and soy, which eventually were used to produce the additives in ultra-processed foods like corn syrup and soy lecithin, he added.</p> <p>“It’s hard to find a processed food, if you look at the ingredients, that doesn’t have corn and soy in there. It’s incredibly cheap – below the cost of production – there’s so much of it, and there’s access to so much of it,” Lilliston said. Today, ultra-processed foods make up more than half of the calories in the American diet, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db536.pdf?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Fupdates%2Ffeature-1.html">data</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> <p>Soy and corn – most of which is<a href="https://www.fb.org/market-intel/crops-feed-livestock-power-exports-fuel-the-economy"> converted</a> to animal feed, ethanol fuel, and byproducts used in UPFs – make up more than half of the country’s cropland. The farms that grow fruits and vegetables (known as specialty crops), are typically smaller and are not eligible for the majority of <a href="https://farm.ewg.org/subsidyprimer.php">subsidies</a>. But, these “are the types of farms that will be providing healthy foods, fruits, and vegetables on plates across the US”, said Jared Hayes, a senior policy analyst at the Environmental Working Group.</p> <p>Before joining Trump’s cabinet, RFK Jr himself blamed agricultural subsidies for America’s addiction to ultra-processed foods. In a 2024 <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2rPM6Mw8WGwqnxQEhV55lG">interview</a>, RFK Jr said the US obesity epidemic was being driven by food “poisoned” by “heavily subsidized” commodity crop derivatives. In a 2024 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trump-can-make-america-healthy-again-rfk-jr-reforms-chronic-disease-crisis-a9b4b8c0">op-ed</a> in the Wall Street Journal, Kennedy listed several steps Trump could take to “Make America Healthy Again,” and among them was reforming crop subsidies.</p> <p>“They make corn, soybeans and wheat artificially cheap, so those crops end up in many processed forms,” he wrote, adding: “Our subsidy program is so backward that <a href="https://archive.is/o/K4E77/https://sentientmedia.org/why-are-farmers-subsidized/%23:~:text=David%20Simon%20writes%20in%20his,vegetables%20it%20recommends%20we%20eat.%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD">less than 2%</a> of farm subsidies go to fruits and vegetables.”</p> <p>The first <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/maha-commission-childhood-chronic-disease-root-causes.html">Maha assessment report</a>, released in May, blamed the food manufacturing industry for rising rates of chronic illness. After its publication, more than 250 food and agriculture groups, including the American Soybean Association and the National Corn Growers Association signed a <a href="https://soygrowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/6-17-25-Post-Report-MAHA-Commission-Stakeholder-Letter-FINAL81.pdf">letter</a> claiming it included “erroneous representations” about food and agriculture and called for “formal inclusion of food and agriculture representatives in the commission’s processes moving forward”.</p> <p>But in the follow-up report, there was little mention of the food industry’s role in children’s health, nor were there suggested pathways to regulate what ingredients companies put in their products. While ultra-processed foods were mentioned 40 times in the initial report, the second, strategy report mentioned the term just twice.</p> <p>“Kennedy has framed himself as an anti-corporate hero, while at the same time utilized the age-old tactic of becoming buddies with the very industries that he purports he wants to change or regulate,” said Rebecca Wolf, the food policy lead at Food and Water Watch.</p> <p>“There’s anti-corporate rhetoric, but at the same time an inability and an unwillingness to actually take on corporate power,” Wolf said. “We’ve just [been] keeping a really close eye on the difference between narrative and policy, and what I’ve seen right now are policies that will not protect people, but in fact, further threaten their health.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/19/inside-the-republican-network-behind-big-sodas-bid-to-pit-maga-against-maha">Inside the Republican network behind big soda’s bid to pit Maga against Maha</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To truly build a healthier US diet, Musicus says the Trump administration, in addition to regulating UPFs, should not be cutting the very programs that make nutritious food and healthcare more accessible to low-income families and individuals.</p> <p>“We’ve seen the federal government cut Snap benefits, write off millions of Americans from their health insurance coverage, slashed programs to help farmers bring local foods into schools, eviscerate government funding for research on nutrition and health and threaten access to life-saving vaccines,” Musicus said, adding that RFK Jr had simultaneously failed to impose meaningful regulation on the food industry.</p> <p>“As a result, the net public health impact of this administration has been negative, despite the fact that they’re constantly talking about improving Americans’ health,” she said.</p>
