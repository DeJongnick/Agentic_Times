<p>In the wake of the 2021 exit of banjo player (and son of the co-founder of GB News) Winston Marshall, Mumford &amp; Sons have reverted to a trio for their fifth album. Marshall’s departure followed an outcry after he praised “alt-right” agitator Andy Ngo. Yet listening to <em>Rushmere</em>, one wonders whether the world might be a better place had every member of the band felt obliged to quit three years earlier, when news broke that they had <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mumford-and-sons-unable-to-banjo-their-way-out-of-jordan-peterson-questions/">hosted Jordan Peterson</a> at their studio.</p> <p>There’s a distinct back-to-basics feel to the album, the drearily unappealing (relative) experimentalism of 2018’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/16/mumford-and-sons-delta-review">Delta</a></em> ditched in favour of the grating folk hoedowns that first made their name or utterly insipid balladry. The default mood is self-pitying and self-justifying, which is even less attractive than that may sound. “I can’t say I’m sorry if I’m always on the run,” mewls Marcus Mumford on Anchor. </p> <p>It’s so miserable that the irritating uptempo songs that recall 2012’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/23/mumford-and-sons-babel-review">Babel</a></em> (the title track, Surrender, Carry On) come across as a welcome relief. On the plus side the band have decided not to also resurrect their toffs-cosplaying-farmhands image this time around. Small mercies. </p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sBwEZUH90M"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7sBwEZUH90M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sBwEZUH90M">Watch the video for Rushmere by Mumford &amp; Sons.</a></figcaption> </figure>
