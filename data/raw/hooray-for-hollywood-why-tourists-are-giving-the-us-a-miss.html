<p><strong>Name:</strong> Hollywood</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Named 1887; incorporated 1903.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Empty Los Angeles neighbourhood, overlooked by a giant sign.</p> <p><strong>Empty? But it’s full of stars! </strong>The only stars in Hollywood are on the pavement.</p> <p><strong>Someone should help them up. </strong>These stars are the commemorative plaques comprising the Walk of Fame, a major tourist attraction.</p> <p><strong>So Hollywood is full of tourists. </strong>Not so much these days – tourism marketing organisation Visit California is predicting a 9 % decline in international tourism in 2025.</p> <p><strong>That’s not great, is it? </strong>It equates to about 170,000 fewer visitors. And things seem even worse in Los Angeles, where businesses on Hollywood Boulevard are reporting a 50% fall in foot traffic this summer.</p> <p><strong>How come? </strong>Several reasons. First, they had those devastating wildfires in January.</p> <p><strong> </strong>Second, the Hollywood Walk of Fame was named the world’s worst tourist attraction in 2023, with disappointed visitors citing a persistent smell of urine.</p> <p><strong>Did that stop anyone visiting? </strong>No, actually. Numbers were up in 2024.</p> <p><strong>What other reason could there be? </strong>We might blame the fallout from the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, with reports of foreign tourists being detained or randomly denied entry.</p> <p><strong>So this is all part of the Trump slump? </strong>He’s certainly not helping. Trump’s hostile and frankly weird treatment of Canada – punitive tariffs, and repeated declarations of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/10/canadas-lonely-battle-in-the-face-of-trump-threats">his intention to annex the country</a> – has contributed to a sharp drop in tourism.</p> <p><strong>How sharp? </strong>California alone has had a 38% <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/12/us-canada-travel-trump">drop in Canadian tourists </a>over the past year, and Canada is its biggest international market.</p> <p><strong>Is this happening to other American tourist spots? </strong>Bookings at Yosemite national park – also in California – were down 50 % over the Memorial Day weekend in May. Las Vegas has seen an 8 % fall so far this year. Florida visitor numbers dropped from 19.4m to 15.9m.</p> <p><strong>So the news is terrible all over. </strong>Overall the US is expected to experience an 8.2 % decline in international tourism in 2025, including 25 % fewer Canadian visitors.</p> <p><strong>How might a tourism expert describe such numbers? </strong>“This is a wake-up call for the US government,” said Julia Simpson, president of the World Travel and Tourism Council.</p> <p><strong>Will Trump see sense before America hosts the World Cup next year? </strong>What do you think?</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “This is bigger than Hollywood – the world’s largest tourist economy is in freefall.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Come to America – your chances of getting in are still pretty high.”</p>
