<p>Rio Tinto is to buy the US company Arcadium Lithium for $6.7bn (£5.1bn), in a huge bet on energy transition despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/04/carmakers-ramp-up-pressure-on-chancellor-for-ev-sales-subsidies">stalling growth in the electric car market</a>.</p> <p>The deal would make the Anglo-Australian miner one of the largest producers of the battery-making metal, alongside Albemarle and SQM.</p> <p>Rio Tinto said it would pay $5.85 a share for Arcadium – an almost 90% premium on top of the US-based lithium miner’s closing price of $3.08 on 3 October, the day before news of a potential deal emerged.</p> <p>The acquisition would give Rio access to lithium mines, processing facilities and deposits in Argentina, Australia, Canada and the US that are all expected to play a key role in manufacturing batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and other purposes. It will also hand the world’s second largest miner a customer base that includes the carmakers Tesla, BMW and General Motors.</p> <p>Rio has taken a bet on the long-term future of the lithium market even as prices for the metal have floundered because of Chinese oversupply and a slowdown in EV sales, resulting in lithium miners emerging as attractive takeover targets.</p> <p>Car manufacturers around the world have for months complained of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/19/car-industry-calls-for-shift-in-eu-emissions-targets-amid-slowing-ev-sales">stalling growth in EV demand</a>. Japan’s Toyota said last week it would delay the start of EV production in the US until 2026, after previously suggesting it would begin at the end of 2025. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/21/ford-writes-off-19bn-as-it-cancels-plans-for-all-electric-large-suv-in-us">Ford</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/sep/04/markets-slump-growth-worries-nvidia-doj-subpoena-uk-eurozone-services-sector-business-live">Volvo</a> are also among companies to have delayed their transition to electric.</p> <p>In the UK, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group, has found that registrations of new EVs grew by just 3.7% in September, compared with a year earlier, while registrations for new diesel cars increased by about 17.2%.</p> <p>Referring to the bid to buy Arcadium, Jakob Stausholm, the chief executive of Rio Tinto, said. “This is a countercyclical expansion aligned with our disciplined capital allocation framework, increasing our exposure to a high-growth, attractive market at the right point in the cycle.”</p> <p>Peter Coleman, the chair of Arcadium, said the cash offer would provide shareholders with “certainty and liquidity” and avoid the risks associated with lithium market fluctuations.</p> <p>Arcadium shares have fallen more than 37% since the start of the year, valuing the company at $4.56bn.</p> <p>Jason Beddow, the managing director of the Australian fund manager Argo Investments, which owns shares in Rio, said the deal made a lot of sense. “Yes, it’s a big premium but stocks have been sold off a lot,” he said.</p> <p>Beddow, who visited the companies’ Canadian operations in recent weeks, said: “They are both close together geographically, they both use Quebec hydropower. Rio has a strong chemicals business in Canada that this will slot into.”</p> <p>The deal, which has been unanimously approved by the companies’ boards, is expected to be completed in mid-2025.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this report.</em></p>
