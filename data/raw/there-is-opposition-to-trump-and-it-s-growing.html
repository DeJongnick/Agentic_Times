<p>In her column (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/28/trump-third-term-president-us-constitution">Trump’s third term? Don’t laugh. He’s never let the rules stop him before, 28 October</a>), Arwa Mahdawi declares that there is no opposition to Trump. But an estimated 7&nbsp;million people participated in No&nbsp;Kings demonstrations in 2,700 places around the US on 18 October. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people protest every day about the Trump regime’s lawless actions. Sixty of my friends and neighbours stand with me at a heavily travelled intersection in north-east Baltimore, waving signs as passing cars, trucks and buses honk their horns in approval. Thousands of Americans contribute financially to legal advocacy groups bringing hundreds of lawsuits challenging the regime’s illegal actions. </p> <p>These are only a few examples of the vitality of a rapidly growing mass-opposition movement. We recognise that we can’t wait for the Democratic party to save us from tyranny; we must save ourselves.<br><strong>Linda Rabben</strong><br><em>Baltimore, Maryland, US</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
