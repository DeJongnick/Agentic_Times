<p>Rangers have appointed Danny Röhl as their manager on an initial two-and-a-half-year deal. The German will assume the position immediately and will be in the dugout for Thursday’s Europa League clash with SK Brann.</p> <p>Röhl had declared himself out of the running last week, when Rangers were in advanced talks with Kevin Muscat, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/19/rangers-managerial-chaos-continues-as-talks-with-kevin-muscat-break-down">those discussions broke down</a>. Muscat joined <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/11/rangers-could-turn-to-danny-rohl-after-steven-gerrard-rules-out-return-as-manager">Steven Gerrard in backing away</a> from the Rangers post despite taking part in detailed negotiations. Gerrard remains out of work and Muscat has stayed with Shanghai Port.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/18/rangers-dundee-united-scottish-premiership-match-report">Managerless Rangers ‘lucky to get a point’ as fans vent anger at players and board</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Ibrox hierarchy therefore turned attention back to Röhl, having initially been concerned by supporter reaction to the prospect of hiring of the 36-year-old. “This has been a thorough process to ensure we identified the right person to lead the club forward,” explained the Rangers vice-chairman, Paraag Marathe.</p> <p><strong>“</strong>It is a huge privilege to be taking on the role of head coach at such an incredible club, recognised around the world,” said Röhl in a statement. “I know it has been a difficult start to the season, but there is still so much to play for in four competitions, and my staff and I will give it everything to reward the supporters and the club.</p> <p>“The expectations here are clear. The fans want to see results now – my mentality and experience is to think in exactly the same way and I have belief in the players that we can achieve this. We have no time to waste, we start straight away. I respect that trust is earned and understand we have to give the supporters confidence in what we are doing by showing it on the pitch from the start.</p> <p>“The expectations are huge and I love this challenge because I set high standards for myself and the team too. Rangers is built on a tradition of hard work, unity and success – that is exactly what you will get from me and what I want my team to represent for all of you. I’m looking forward to meeting the squad and getting down to work ahead of Thursday’s game away to Brann.”</p> <p>Röhl’s only previous role as a manager came at Sheffield Wednesday, whom he left in the summer amid off-field chaos. He was close to landing the Rangers job in the same period but the club turned to Russell Martin. In what proved a disastrous hire, castigated by fans from the outset, Martin lasted 123 days. His sacking came more than a fortnight ago.</p>
