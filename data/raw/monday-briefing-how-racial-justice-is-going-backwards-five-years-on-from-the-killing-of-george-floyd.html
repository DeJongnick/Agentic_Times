<p>Good morning. I’m Aamna Mohdin, the Guardian’s community affairs correspondent, and I’ll be bringing you First Edition alongside Archie over the next couple of months.</p> <p>It’s been five years since George Floyd’s agonising cry – “I can’t breathe” – sent shockwaves around the world. His killing by a white police officer sparked what may have been the largest social movement in US history, and protests in the UK were the most widespread since the abolition of slavery. Millions took to the streets, led by young people, to assert the power of three simple words: Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>More than 260 towns and cities across the UK held protests in June and July 2020, from Monmouth in south Wales to Shetland in Scotland. An unprecedented reckoning that featured statements of solidarity from institutions, including the Bank of England and Cambridge university, and pledges to pay reparations by the Church of England, was followed by an intense backlash. Anti-migrant rioters attacked mosques and set fire to asylum hotels. Donald Trump returned to the US presidency last year and Reform UK surged in this month’s local elections, vowing to dismantle equality initiatives.</p> <p>How did we get here? To try to answer that, I worked with the Guardian’s community affairs correspondent in Manchester, <em><strong>Chris Osuh</strong></em>, to analyse nearly 600 recommendations across 12 government-commissioned race reports dating back to 1981. What we found was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/25/only-a-third-of-recommendations-to-tackle-endemic-racism-in-uk-implemented">a pattern of symbolic progress and systemic inaction</a>.</p> <p>For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Chris about how this moment fits into the UK’s long and hostile history of responding to racial reckoning. That’s after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Gaza </strong></em>| Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours have killed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/25/israeli-strikes-over-past-24-hours-killed-people-in-gaza-health-officials-say">at least 38 people</a> in Gaza, health officials in the Palestinian territory have said, bringing the death toll to more than 100 in less than three days. Meanwhile, reports emerged that a doctor caring for severely wounded babies, Alaa al-Najjar, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/25/gaza-doctor-last-goodbye-nine-children-killed-airstrike">lost nine of her 10 children</a> in an Israeli strike.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Ukraine </strong></em>| Donald Trump has warned that if Vladimir Putin attempts to conquer all of Ukraine, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/25/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-attacks">it will lead to the “downfall” of Russia</a>, while also criticising Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a Sunday night post on Truth Social. Trump said he was considering new sanctions, saying of Putin: “He’s killing a lot of people. What the hell happened to him?”</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Banking</strong></em> | Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the disgraced ex-boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/26/taxpayer-loss-natwest-disgraced-ex-boss-pension">is estimated to be receiving an annual pension worth nearly £600,000</a>, as the government prepares to declare a £10bn loss after selling its final stake. The banking group, now known as NatWest, is expected to return to full private ownership within days.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>​Europe </strong></em>| The bodies of five skiers have been found in the mountains near Switzerland’s luxury resort of Zermatt, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/25/five-skiers-found-dead-rimpfischhorn-zermatt-switzerland">police said</a>. A helicopter was sent to survey the area around the Rimpfischhorn after climbers alerted authorities to abandoned skis near the summit on Saturday.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Media</strong></em> | Alan Yentob, the former BBC executive and TV presenter, has died at the age of 78, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/may/25/alan-yentob-former-bbc-executive-tv-presenter-dies">his family has announced</a>. His wife, Philippa Walker, said: “He was curious, funny, annoying, late and creative in every cell of his body. But more than that, he was the kindest of men and a profoundly moral man.”</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: ‘The fallout from this backlash will be​ far-reaching’</h2>    <p>At the height of the 2020 UK protests, then prime minister Boris Johnson announced a new inquiry into racial disparities. The response was met with widespread frustration, including from David Lammy, now the foreign secretary, who pointed out that the UK had already produced numerous inquiries on the subject (including his own) and whose recommendations remained unimplemented.</p> <p>This cycle is depressingly familiar. When there’s a riot, an uprising, or a national tragedy, the government commissions an inquiry. These often produce profound conclusions, only to be quietly shelved. After the 1981 Brixton riots, there was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/26/scarman-report-into-brixton-riots-published-archive-1981">Scarman inquiry</a>. After the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years">Macpherson report</a>, which famously concluded the Met Police was “institutionally racist”. After the 2001 northern riots, the Cantle report, and after the Windrush scandal, there was the 2018 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/21/what-is-the-windrush-review-scandal">Windrush review</a>.</p> <p>Guardian analysis found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/25/only-a-third-of-recommendations-to-tackle-endemic-racism-in-uk-implemented">fewer than a third</a> of those reports’ recommendations have been fully actioned, and that progress on a number of recommendations has been reversed or significantly eroded during years of government austerity policies.</p> <p>The data shows that around a third of recommendations were not implemented at all. The remainder were either partially enacted or deemed not measurable. Even where implementation was claimed, changes were often fragmented, underfunded, or lacked clear oversight and accountability.</p> <p>The findings led some of the commissioners involved to urge ministers to finally break this “doom loop” of inaction.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>A waste of time?</strong></p> <p>The analysis is stark and left me wondering about the intent of holding these types of inquiries.</p> <p><strong>Aamna</strong>: Were you surprised by the findings?</p> <p><strong>Chris</strong>: Not really. It fits the pattern: the process of holding an inquiry becomes more important than its conclusions. These reports often contain powerful findings, but they don’t lead to action.</p> <p><strong>Aamna</strong>: I can’t help but wonder whether these inquiries are a waste of time?</p> <p><strong>Chris</strong>: I wouldn’t say that. They serve an important purpose in putting these issues on the public record. They make it impossible to deny that these disparities exist. But I agree that we need to move beyond documenting the problem and start delivering change.</p> <p><strong>Aamna</strong>: What I found particularly interesting is that some of the recommendations focused on unconscious bias training, celebrating the UK’s diverse communities, as well as attempts to increase representation of the workforce. These became cornerstones of corporate and public sector equality and inclusion strategies.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>pendulum </strong><strong>swings</strong></p>    <p>Five years ago, Keir Starmer, newly appointed leader of the Labour party, took the knee in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. But earlier this month, Starmer the prime minister was accused of echoing Enoch Powell after warning, during the launch of the government’s immigration white paper, that Britain risked becoming an “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/uk-risks-becoming-island-of-strangers-without-more-immigration-curbs-starmer-says">island of strangers</a>”. His claim that “uncontrolled” migration had caused “incalculable” damage to British society marked a watershed moment in Labour’s relationship with Black and Asian voters.</p> <p>The contrast between the two Starmers captures just how sharply the political pendulum has swung to the right, in both the UK and the US, on issues of racial justice. Institutions that once rushed to issue statements of solidarity with ethnic minority communities are now retreating.</p> <p>Industry experts describe a chilling effect on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. The Bank of England’s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, and the Financial Conduct Authority recently announced they would not impose new diversity rules on financial firms, opting instead to back voluntary industry-led initiatives. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, BT and Lloyds Banking Group have all announced cutbacks to diversity targets and inclusion programmes.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Wider ramifications</strong></p> <p>​The picture appears to show the consequences of this rollback will likely affect many different groups.</p> <p><strong>Aamna: </strong>What happens next, and how far back might the backlash go? </p> <p><strong>Chris:</strong> I’m not sure people realise just how far-reaching the fallout from this backlash against DEI will be. There’s a perception that, since George Floyd’s murder, efforts to tackle inequality have somehow meant Black people are being favoured over white people. But what’s often missed is that DEI has benefited a wide range of groups across society.</p> <p>Rolling back DEI doesn’t just impact racial equality. It has serious consequences for all kinds of workers, from women’s rights to disability inclusion. The conversation may have started with race, but the broader goal was always to make workplaces more inclusive across the board.</p> <p><strong>Aamna:</strong> Even left wing critics of DEI, who argue it’s often a shallow, corporate box-ticking exercise, are sounding the alarm. They see the backlash not just as opposition to diversity, but part of a deeper ideological project: an attempt to resegregate our economy and society.</p> <p><strong>Chris:</strong> Exactly. The signs are there that dismantling DEI is part of a wider, more aggressively rightwing political agenda.</p> <p><strong>Aamna:</strong> So lots to be cheerful about, then.</p> <p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s easy to feel frightened by all this. But there are reasons for hope. In the UK, you might hear a particular narrative from government or politicians, but they can’t control everything. There are businesses and institutions still determined to stay the course, despite the reactionary noise. And industry leaders I spoke to said that despite the backlash, DEI will likely survive in a “rebranded” form in the UK.</p> <p><strong>Aamna:</strong> I want to end on something I’ve been thinking about a lot: what does it mean to be a Black journalist covering this moment? So many people fought hard for our jobs, and for our specialisms to be taken seriously. I’m reminded of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/23/black-deaths-why-journalists-keep-missing-story-shootings-media">what Gary Younge once said</a> that we’ve seen so many dogs biting people we’ve become numb to it, yet we’re still trained to chase the more spectacular ‘man bites dog’ stories. The real scandal is being overlooked: dogs keep biting men, again and again.</p> <p><strong>Chris:</strong> In so much of the media, Black experiences are talked about rather than expressed by Black people themselves. There’s a constant, low hum of discrimination, it is so normalised it often goes unremarked. Its important to be able to challenge that and to call out injustice. But there’s also great deal of positivity about minority communities in Britain, particularly at this time, that is not covered, so to be able to also celebrate the tangible, joyful things our communities achieve is a real privilege.</p> <p><strong>Read more:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/25/only-a-third-of-recommendations-to-tackle-endemic-racism-in-uk-implemented">Only a third of recommendations to tackle endemic racism in UK implemented</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/25/five-years-on-from-black-lives-matter-has-the-uk-made-progress-on-ethnic-equalities">Five years on from Black Lives Matter, has the UK made progress on ethnic equalities?</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/may/25/george-floyd-murder-site">George Floyd’s family fights for sacred ground where he took his last breath: ‘That’s my blood’</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>One should know to never miss Nesrine Malik’s column.
