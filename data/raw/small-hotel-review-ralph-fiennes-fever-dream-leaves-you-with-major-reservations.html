<p>Small Hotel is a play that defies category, or even explanation. This might be a work of outlandish genius, or a devised end of year A-level project featuring world-class actors (led by Ralph Fiennes and Francesca Annis). It is very funny, although perhaps it doesn’t always mean to be, and well acted, despite the ropey material.</p> <p>Written by Rebecca Lenkiewicz, the story – more a fever dream – is of a fading TV show host, Larry (Fiennes), stranded in a liminal space with a luminous bar and a Liverpudlian waiter with an eye-patch (Rachel Tucker). His life seems to be flashing before him, or rather circling around him, on Bob Crowley’s stage revolve.</p> <p>The last in a trio of productions in Fiennes’ season at this theatre, it is a puzzle too strange to solve. Larry is haunted by memories of an overbearing mother (Annis, poisonously brilliant); a teenage lover, Marianne (Rosalind Eleazar, a cool cat) with whom he is reunited 20 years on; and a twin brother (also hilariously played by Fiennes who mostly appears in that role as an enlarged projection).</p>    <p>In a production directed by Holly Race Roughan, screens with crackling static conjure a world of black-and-white film, as do the bursts of tap dance. It seems very much an ode to Hollywood screen classics, but also combines a darkly surreal musical dream world reminiscent of Dennis Potter’s The Singing Detective with the limbo universe of A Matter of Life and Death.</p> <p>Beyond that, it is all open to interpretation, especially when randomly declaimed haiku are thrown into the mix. Mother-son tensions bubble dangerously, a romance between Larry and Marianne steams up again and the dancing continues apace. There is a great satirical scene in which Larry interviews Marianne, live on TV. She has become a hotshot Hollywood movie star, but it is rather a stretch to believe she is drawn back to Larry, who has all the energy and charisma of a punctured tyre. It might, of course, be a middle-aged man’s fantasy in this warp of dreams, hallucinations and reality.</p> <p>Just when you think the last tap dance is done, there is the strangest of Beckettian endings. This is less a play than an experience of sheer, hypnotising madness.</p> <p>• At <a href="https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/events/small-hotel/">Theatre Royal Bath</a> until 18 October</p>
