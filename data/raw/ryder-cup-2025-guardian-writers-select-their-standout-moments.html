<h2>Ewan Murray</h2> <p><strong>Player of the tournament</strong> Viktor Hovland. Well, that was a significant half-point on day three … No, seriously, the award belongs to Tommy Fleetwood. Singles defeat should not mask his overall performance. Surely a major winner in waiting.</p> <p><strong>Rookie of the tournament</strong> Cameron Young edges out JJ Spaun for his tenacity in seeing off Justin Rose on Sunday. This set the tone for an almighty US run at the Ryder Cup. The greatest comeback was on.</p> <p><strong>Best celebration</strong> Few things in 2025’s year of sport will beat Shane Lowry’s crying, dancing, screaming combination when the Ryder Cup had at least been retained. What a moment for the Irishman.</p> <p><strong>Best match</strong> Rory McIlroy’s and Lowry’s halved fourball clash with Sam Burns and Patrick Cantlay on Friday afternoon. Utterly gripping to the very last putts.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2025/sep/29/eagles-donalds-and-bubbly-ryder-cup-2025-in-pictures">Eagles, Donalds and bubbly: Ryder Cup 2025 – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Funniest moment</strong> Bryson DeChambeau exiting stage left after man-mountain Ian Finnis, Fleetwood’s caddie, stepped forward to protect his man during a Saturday afternoon war of words. One battle DeChambeau smartly thought better of.</p> <p><strong>In 2027 Europe will …</strong> ensure the US team have rose petals thrown at their feet in Ireland. Kill them with kindness. It would be the sensible antidote to the moronic Bethpage backdrop. The Ryder Cup does not have to be this way.</p>    <h2>Andy Bull</h2> <p><strong>Player of the tournament</strong> Other people played more games, made more putts and won more points, but the truth is that Europe would have lost this cup if it hadn’t been for the way Shane Lowry played in the big moments on Saturday and Sunday.</p> <p><strong>Rookie of the tournament</strong> Cameron Young. He carried the US team through the first two days, when he won two of their four-and-a-half points, then led them out in the Sunday singles by beating Justin Rose in a match that went all the way to the 18th.</p> <p><strong>Best celebration</strong> Not sure if it counts as best or not but Lowry certainly has the scariest. There were times during his Saturday fourball when you couldn’t tell if he was celebrating another good putt or wading in to settle a bar fight.</p> <p><strong>Best match</strong> Rose’s and Fleetwood’s Saturday fourball against Scottie Scheffler and DeChambeau had just about everything, including more birdies than a quarrel of sparrows, and a stramash between the caddies.</p> <p><strong>Funniest moment</strong> MC Heather McMahan being booed into awkward silence when she tried to lead the crowd at the 1st tee into a new chant which involved singing Scottie Scheffler’s name to the tune of We Will Rock You.</p> <p><strong>In 2027 Europe will …</strong> likely be a hell of a lot friendlier than New York.</p>    <h2>Bryan Armen Graham</h2> <p><strong>Player of the tournament</strong> Rory McIlroy. The heartbeat of Europe: relentless from tee to green, clutch on key putts and unflinching under fire. Unbeaten over the first two days amid feral vitriol and hostility.</p> <p><strong>Rookie of the tournament</strong> Cameron Young. The debutant playing in his home state gave the US their spark: fearless off the tee, nerveless on the greens, steady when the din rose highest. A 3-1-0 record and the star of the week for his captain, Keegan Bradley.</p> <p><strong>Best celebration</strong> Was it Lowry’s Balanchine-flecked frolic after holing from six feet to retain the trophy? Or was it Lowry’s spicy two-word clapback at an unruly spectator after his eagle from 50ft to turn the Saturday fourballs classic blue?</p> <p><strong>Best match</strong> McIlroy and Lowry beating Thomas and Young. Golf under siege: extra troopers, shushing opponents, constant needle. Europe landed the heavier putts and walked off to songs, not sirens.</p>    <p><strong>Funniest moment</strong> Watching a gaggle of about two dozen fans draped in Irish flags serenading DeChambeau as he smacked balls on the practice range on Saturday night more than an hour after the close of play.</p> <p><strong>In 2027 USA will …</strong> swear lessons were learned, then rediscover the same flaw: individuals first, team second. The culture rewards brands, not bonds; pairings fray and Europe feast again.</p> <h2>Scott Murray</h2> <p><strong>Player of the tournament</strong> It’s impossible not to love Tommy Fleetwood. Four points out of five, and a smiling beacon of goodwill amid intense provocation. He even managed to disarm Scottie Scheffler’s caddie with charm, just as the livid looper was about to make a proper fool of himself during <em>that</em> encroachment brouhaha.</p>    <p><strong>Rookie of the tournament</strong> Cameron Young made five birdies in his first 13 holes as a Ryder Cup player, becoming the first American to win his debut match by six holes since Phil Mickelson 30 years ago. Then he held his nerve in the face of Justin Rose’s singles comeback. The real deal from beginning to end.</p> <p><strong>Best celebration</strong> A toss-up between two performances diametrically opposed on the supercool spectrum: Rose walking in a big 20-foot swinger at 8 on day two with the ball barely halfway to the hole, and Shane Lowry showcasing his hitherto untapped talent for interpretive dance.</p> <p><strong>Best match</strong> JJ Spaun – who ran Young close as best rookie – bested Jon Rahm and Sepp Straka with laser irons into 17 and 18 on Saturday afternoon, spinning victory from defeat with a proper matchplay smash and grab. Top moxie, especially as it avoided a session bluewash. Rahm can console himself with the shot of the tournament, chipping in earlier that day on 8, knee-deep in the bunker, hands down the shaft, Seve in the sky.</p> <p><strong>Funniest moment</strong> “Guys, shut the fuck up!” Rory McIlroy, voice dripping with disdain, dealing with some fools. Then swiveling 180 before arrowing an iron from 149 yards to 3ft to win the match. Best not poke the bear. An all-time Ryder Cup moment that will never fail to raise a smile. One of Bryson’s drives landing in a trashcan was too on the nose.</p> <p><strong>In 2027 Europe will …</strong> still happily do it all for nothing.</p>
