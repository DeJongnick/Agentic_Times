<p>The BBC has asked Huw Edwards to return £200,000 that he was paid after his arrest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/aug/01/huw-edwards-scandal-questions-facing-bbc">in November last year</a>, in the wake of the disgraced presenter admitting making indecent images of children.</p> <p>The BBC chair, Samir Shah, said Edwards is a “villain” who “betrayed the trust of staff and our audiences in the most egregious possible way” while living a “double life”.</p> <p>In an email to staff, Shah suggested the newsreader had deceived the BBC by failing to acknowledge his guilt at the time of his arrest: “Mr Edwards knew what he had done but he still took licence fee money to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds.”</p> <p>As a result, Shah said Edwards should repay the money to the BBC – while insisting the real victims are “those children for whose degradation Huw Edwards provided a market for”.</p> <p>The BBC does not have an easy legal route to claw back the £200,000, so it is appealing to Edwards to return the funds on the basis that he was not “upfront” about his guilt when asked about his arrest.</p> <p>The presenter had been signed off work on full pay since last June after the Sun disclosed his financial payments to a young man for sexually explicit images, along with other allegations about inappropriate messages sent to younger BBC employees.</p> <p>In November, Edwards was arrested on an entirely unrelated matter after his number was found by South Wales police in a phone belonging to a convicted paedophile. This ultimately led to him pleading guilty to making images of young children.</p> <p>A small number of BBC executives, including the director general, Tim Davie, and the BBC News boss, Deborah Turness, were informed of Edwards’s arrest last autumn, but with no charges brought and no indication as to how he would plead, they did not sack him immediately – a decision they may now regret. The newsreader eventually resigned from the BBC in April after being paid hundreds of thousands of pounds while on medical leave.</p> <p>Edwards was eventually charged with having 41 indecent images of children, which had been sent to him by another man on WhatsApp, and last month pleaded guilty to all offences.</p> <p>Staff in the BBC newsroom have been furious at Edwards for continuing to collect his salary while facing such serious charges, especially at a time when other employees have been going through redundancy procedures and faced below-inflation pay rises. He was one of the BBC’s highest-paid stars at the time of his departure from the organisation, having just signed a new contract on an increased salary of £435,000.</p> <p>The BBC board strongly backed Davie’s handling of the incident and shifted the blame to Edwards. They said Davie and his team did what they could, given contractural obligations to the newsreader and what was known by the BBC at that time.</p> <p>They said: “Today, the board has authorised the executive to seek the return of salary paid to Mr Edwards from the time he was arrested in November last year. Mr Edwards pleaded guilty to an appalling crime. Had he been upfront when asked by the BBC about his arrest, we would never have continued to pay him public money. He has clearly undermined trust in the BBC and brought us into disrepute.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/04/a-powerful-man-given-free-rein-and-indulged-huw-edwards-is-proof-the-bbc-hasnt-changed">A powerful man given free rein and indulged, Huw Edwards is proof the BBC hasn’t changed | Jane Martinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They also announced that the board had commissioned an independent review that would “make recommendations on practical steps that could strengthen a workplace culture in line with BBC values”.</p> <p>The BBC is bracing itself for further questions about Davie’s handling of the incident when parliament returns in September, with the director general expected to face questions from the new Conservative-led Commons culture select committee.</p> <p>The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said she would not intervene in the corporation’s operations but she had spoken to the BBC chair to discuss the Edwards case. She said: “BBC staff must be able to feel safe in the workplace and be confident that if non-editorial complaints are raised they will be acted upon and dealt with fairly and decisively.”</p>
