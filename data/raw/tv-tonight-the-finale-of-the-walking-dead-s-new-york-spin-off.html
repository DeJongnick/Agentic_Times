Things aren’t looking much better for her frenemy Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who suspects – rightly! – that smarmy rival Bruegel (Kim Coates) is up to no good. The story concludes for now with Maggie having to make a painful choice. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2><strong>Saving Lives at Sea</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC Two</strong></p> <p>More tense and tearjerking real-life rescues in the company of RNLI lifeboat crews.

Next, he’s off to the melon fields of Murcia. “But not just any melon. It’s a piel de sapo melon. What does that mean? ‘Toad skin.’” It tastes amazing, though. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2><strong>Talking Pictures: The Silence of the Lambs</strong></h2> <p><strong>9.35pm, BBC Four</strong></p>    <p>Celia Imrie digs deep into the BBC archives to revisit one of cinema’s most sinister stories.
