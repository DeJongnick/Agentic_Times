<p>Police have seized dozens of supercars collectively worth more than £6m, including Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bentleys, during a crackdown on antisocial driving in London.</p> <p>Seventy-two luxury vehicles were taken off the streets in an operation targeting nuisance driving in the West End after complaints from residents, businesses and visitors about high-value cars causing disruption in and around Hyde Park, Kensington and Chelsea.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police said the cars, including twin purple Lamborghinis, were either unroadworthy or being driven illegally.</p>    <p>Officers worked with the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB) last weekend to issue tickets for a range of offences including driving with no insurance, no licence, disqualification, false documentation and fraudulent number plates.</p> <p>Several stolen vehicles were recovered, with 10 others found to have no valid MoT and 11 without road tax.</p> <p>Special chief officer James Deller, from the Met’s Special Constabulary, said: “The Met has already reduced neighbourhood crime by 19% over recent months and we’re addressing antisocial behaviour caused by uninsured drivers.</p> <p>“This has been a great opportunity to work with the Motor Insurers’ Bureau and for officers to speak with members of the public about the work we do, educate drivers and enforce the law.”</p>    <p>Eight people were arrested for alleged offences including actual bodily harm (ABH), criminal damage, drug offences, theft and immigration breaches, the force added.</p> <p>Martin Saunders, the head of uninsured driving prevention at the MIB, said: “We urge all motorists to check their insurance policy is in place, is appropriate for their needs, and to reach out to their insurer if they are unsure on any part of their policy.”</p>
