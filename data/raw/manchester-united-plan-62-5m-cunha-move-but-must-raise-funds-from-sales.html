<p>Manchester United are pushing to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves but may have to raise the money to trigger his £62.5m release clause by selling Marcus Rashford or other players.</p> <p>Ruben Amorim has identified the 25-year-old Brazilian as his prime target for the No 10 berth, one of the head coach’s two priority positions, along with a centre-forward.</p> <p>Rashford is on loan at Aston Villa, who have an option to buy the forward for £40m. United could get a higher fee if Rashford were sold to another club. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/22/pundits-showy-partisanship-reflects-footballs-embrace-of-fan-centric-populism">Pundits’ showy partisanship reflects football’s embrace of fan-centric populism | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rashford earns about £365,000 a week and will have three years on his contract in the close season. His transfer would release about another £56m in saved salary, giving United close to £100m to finance the deal for Cunha. </p> <p>The Brazilian is thought to earn about £90,000 a week, so if he agreed terms for five years with a considerable salary increase, offloading ­Rashford should allow United to finance most of the purchase.</p> <p>Rashford is minded that he will not play again competitively for United while Amorim and this executive are at Old Trafford, owing to a breakdown in the relationship.</p> <p>Jadon Sancho, Antony, Casemiro and Rasmus Højlund are other players whose departure would boost United’s transfer budget. Amorim’s first-choice signing at centre-forward is Liam Delap, who has a £30m release if Ipswich are relegated, which is all but guaranteed.</p> <p>Sancho is on loan at Chelsea, who have an obligation to buy the forward for £22m-£25m but can pay United £5m if they decide to send him back. If he returns to Old Trafford his asking price would be a minimum of £20m. Offloading Sancho would source most of Delap’s cost.</p> <p>Antony has proved a success at Real Betis since moving on loan in January and United would hope to recoup at least £30m for the forward, who cost £81.5m in the summer of 2022.</p> <p>United retain an interest in ­Napoli’s Victor Osimhen, who has a release clause of about €75m (£64.5m). But before any deal for the Nigeria international, who is on loan at Galatasaray, could be considered, further money beyond any sale of Antony would need to be raised.</p> <p>The departure of Casemiro, who has a year left in the summer on a £370,000-a-week deal, would draw a nominal fee, and Højlund’s price would be about £30m.</p>
