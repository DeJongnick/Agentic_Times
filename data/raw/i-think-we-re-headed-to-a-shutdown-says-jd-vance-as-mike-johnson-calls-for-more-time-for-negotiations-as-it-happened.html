Here is the full text:</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaza will be a de-radicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.</p></li> <li><p>Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.</p></li> <li><p>If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.</p></li> <li><p>Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.</p></li> <li><p>Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after Oct. 7, 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.</p></li> <li><p>Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.</p></li> <li><p>Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the Jan. 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.</p></li> <li><p>Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the Jan. 19, 2025 agreement.</p></li> <li><p>Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the “Board of Peace,” which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p></li> <li><p>This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump’s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.</p></li> <li><p>A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.</p></li> <li><p>No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.</p></li> <li><p>A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.</p></li> <li><p>The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A de-confliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.</p></li> <li><p>Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (I.D.F.) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and time frames linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the United States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.</p></li> <li><p>In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.</p></li> <li><p>An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence to try and change mind-sets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.</p></li> <li><p>While Gaza redevelopment advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.</p></li> <li><p>The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-29T18:51:48.915Z">at 7.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68dac8e08f080edbe2663c9e" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-29T18:02:02.069Z">7.02pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Netanyahu 'expressed deep regret' that Israeli strike on Doha killed Qatari serviceman, says White House</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here is the White House’s readout confirming the trilateral call reported earlier during which Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/29/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-white-house-us-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68dabc688f08206a90f0905c#block-68dabc688f08206a90f0905c">apologized to Qatari PM</a> Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani over Israel’s strikes on Doha earlier this month.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Today, President Donald J.

Gaza is a part of it. But it’s peace in the Middle East,” he said.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>More than 100,000 federal workers are to formally resign on Tuesday, the largest such mass event in US history, as part of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> program designed to make sweeping cuts to the federal workforce.</strong> With Congress facing a deadline of Tuesday to authorize more funding or spark a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/government-shutdown-explainer">government shutdown</a>, the White House has also ordered federal agencies to draw up plans for large-scale firings of workers if the partisan fight fails to yield a deal.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump has reversed course and is purportedly planning to host a bipartisan gathering of the top four US congressional leaders at the White House on Monday afternoon in a last-ditch effort to avoid a looming government shutdown</strong>, the House speaker and the US president’s fellow Republican, Mike Johnson, said on Sunday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/james-comey-fbi-director-indictment">indictment</a> of former FBI director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey">James Comey</a> is part of a concerted effort by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> to “rewrite history” in his favor</strong>, a former senior White House lawyer claimed on Sunday as he warned of more retribution to come for the president’s political opponents.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The mayor of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York City</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-adams">Eric Adams</a>, announced on Sunday that he was abandoning his faltering bid to win re-election, just over a month before election day.</strong> Adams, who was trailing in the polls, was elected as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrat</a> but ran for re-election as an independent after he was indicted on federal corruption charges, which were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/eric-adams-corruption-case-dismissed">then dropped</a> by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> in exchange for his cooperation on immigration raids.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Children, including the very young, have been spending weeks or months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility in a remote part of Texas where outside monitors have heard accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation and kids struggling for hygiene supplies and prompt medical attention</strong>, as revealed in a stark new court filing.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-29T10:58:06.490Z">at 11.58am BST</time></p>  </div>
