<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has targeted Massachusetts as its next location to begin arresting and deporting immigrants, a Department of Homeland Security official confirmed to NBC News on Saturday.</p> <p>DHS and its US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm are calling the operation Patriot 2.0, modifying the name of a May deportation surge that led to the arrest of 1,500 people in the state, according to the reports.</p> <p>A spokesperson for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>The operation is expected to last several weeks, the New York Times said, quoting unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter. One of the sources told the Times that Patriot 2.0 was focused on targeting immigrants who had been released from custody despite Ice agents attempting to pick them up from local jails.</p> <p>It was not immediately clear how many federal officers were involved in the crackdown, which comes as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/chicago-mexican-independence-day-trump">Chicago braces</a> for a Trump administration ramp-up of deportations in the third-largest US city.</p> <p>NBC10 Boston quoted a statement from a DHS spokesperson as deriding the Boston mayor Michelle Wu’s so-called sanctuary policies.</p> <p>“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens. ICE is arresting sex offenders, pedophiles, murderers, drug dealers, and gang members released by local authorities,” the statement reported by NBC10 said.</p> <p>Tensions between Wu and the Trump administration have been steadily building since March when Wu <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/politics/live-updates/boston-mayor-wu-testifies-before-congress-on-immigration-policies">testified</a> before Congress alongside <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/boston-chicago-denver-nyc-sanctuary-mayors-to-be-held-publicly-accountable-on-march-5/">three other Democratic mayors</a> to defend their cities’ immigration policies – specifically so-called sanctuary city laws that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/donald-trump-sanctuary-cities">limit state and local law enforcement cooperation</a> with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).</p> <p>Critics of these policies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/sanctuary-cities-trump-immigration.html">claim</a> that sanctuary laws undermine federal law enforcement’s ability to arrest and deport individuals with criminal records.</p> <p>As part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, it has pushed for mass deportations and targeted “sanctuary cities” in particular.</p> <p>Wu has defended her city’s policies in a letter to US attorney general Pam Bondi: “The City of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/boston">Boston</a> is the safest major city in America,” she wrote. “Our progress is the result of decades of community policing and partnership between local law enforcement and community leaders, who share a commitment to making Boston a safe and welcoming home for everyone.”</p> <p>In response, the acting Ice director, Todd Lyons, said that the agency intended to “<a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/ice-director-says-hell-flood-boston-after-mayor-wu-refuses-to-comply-with-feds/3794197/">flood the zone</a>, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions”.</p> <p>As the threat of federal actions looms, Wu said last week that her administration was actively preparing for the possibility of a federal national guard deployment.</p> <p>Wu also said her administration was reviewing relevant legal precedents and working “very closely” with community members “to ensure people know what’s happening and that this is not something that is needed or wanted or legally sound”.</p> <p><em>Anna Betts contributed reporting</em></p>
