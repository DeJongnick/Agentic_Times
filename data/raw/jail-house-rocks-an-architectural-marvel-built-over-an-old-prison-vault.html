<p>Visitors to Hidden House, in London’s Clerkenwell, often need a little help to find it. It’s virtually invisible from three sides because it nestles into the angles of an old boundary wall that runs between back gardens and an imposing Victorian school. As owner Selim Bayer explains: “You’re walking around the wall and suddenly there’s a door. People are always amazed and ask, ‘Oh! Are we here?’”</p> <p>It’s not just an obscure spot, but also an unpromising one. The house is built on the site of a caretaker’s shed and the scrap of wasteland behind it. Because it is bounded on three sides by a Grade II listed wall, only the fourth side has windows. So it’s a revelation to come inside and be struck by the sense of space and light in here. It is proof positive of the power of good architecture and has justly earned a place on the <a href="https://www.architecture.com/awards-and-competitions-landing-page/awards/riba-house-of-the-year">Riba House of the Year</a> long-list, currently being explored in a special <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/04/grand-designs-presenter-kevin-mccloud-seeks-to-raise-50m-to-build-600-homes-a-year"><em>Grand Designs</em></a><em> </em>television series.</p>    <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Suddenly there's a door. People are always amazed and ask, ‘Oh! Are we here?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This house has been a while in the making. It sits over the former prison vaults of the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerkenwell_Prison">Clerkenwell House of Detention</a> – which is not as spooky as it sounds, the vaults having long since been converted into offices. When the site’s landlord wanted to convert the shed above the vaults into a dwelling, he asked <a href="http://coffeyarchitects.com/">Coffey Architects</a>, a young practice then based in the vaults, to come up with a design and get the planning permission. But once this was in place, the landlord sold up.</p> <p>Bayer, an Istanbul architect looking for a London base with his wife Eren, a graphic designer, brought the architects back in. It might seem strange for one architect to hire another but, as Bayer explains: “Coffey already understood the site and the planning situation, I liked their style and they were really friendly and easy-going, so it made good sense.” Practice boss Phil Coffey assigned the project to a young member of the team, Ella Wright, and she and Bayer went back to the drawing board.</p> <p>Like much great architecture, the house’s key features are a reaction to the constraints of the site. First, they needed to bring in light and did this with elegant glass-topped coffers in the ceilings. Continuing the “hidden” theme, the frames sit out of sight, providing a serene and simple look. “We love the way the ceiling creates a beautiful shadow-play as light falls differently on each plane,” says Bayer.</p>    <p>The restrained palette of materials includes concrete for the fire surround-cum-bench, the kitchen splashback, bathroom shelving and for the floors. “It ages beautifully and has a finish like marble,” says Bayer. The floor was poured in sections that align with the ceiling coffers and wall panels to zone each area and create a subtle sense of geometry.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>We put so much thought into where and how everything would be stored – it was like designing a boat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Oak panelling offsets the concrete and glass to bring a feeling of cosiness and warmth to the space, as well as concealing an impressive amount of storage throughout the house – the hidden element at play again. “We put so much thought into where and how everything would be stored – it was like designing a boat,” says Bayer. Even kitchen essentials such as the kettle and toaster are concealed in a cabinet to avoid clutter.</p> <p>Bayer and Wright designed much of the furniture themselves. The dining table seats six, but slots into a niche when it’s just dinner for two. In the master bedroom the glass roof light slides out of sight at the touch of a button. “We can look up and see the trees, the sky, the stars – it feels like the countryside, in the heart of London.”</p> <p><em>The winner of the Riba/</em>Grand Designs<em> House of the Year will be revealed on 28 November on Channel 4 at 9pm (</em><a href="http://coffeyarchitects.com/"><em>coffeyarchitects.com</em></a><em>)</em></p>
