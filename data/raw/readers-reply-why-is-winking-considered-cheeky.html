<p>Why is winking considered cheeky? What about briefly closing one eye suggests impudence, flirtatiousness or mischievousness? <em>Caroline, by email</em></p> <p><em>Send new questions to </em><strong><a href="mailto:nq@theguardian.com">nq@theguardian.com</a></strong><em>.</em></p> <h2>Readers reply</h2> <p>Winking has to be interpreted in context. Yes, it can be cheeky, but it can also serve as an affectionate show of support (“you got this!”), a flirtatious gesture or, as the Canadian prime minister so masterfully employed it, a signal to the world that one fully understands the absurd circumstance in which he finds himself. Winking at someone in the wrong context could obviously land you in an awkward or even confrontational dilemma. Because it’s so versatile, we must have situational awareness and an understanding of the audience. <strong>GlimmerTwinTX</strong></p> <p>Social anthropologists believe that winking originated from a deeply ingrained need to find a use for the semicolon key prior to the invention of the emoji. <strong>EddieChorepost</strong></p> <p>Winking is considered cheekier than blinking. Otherwise, we’d be very naughty indeed. <strong>gleebitz</strong></p> <p>Because the English are sex mad. <strong>Tavennaser</strong></p> <p>There are certain interesting features to winking. It’s silent, so it can be directed (to some extent) towards or away from people. It parasitises an automatic, unconscious behaviour and gives it a kind of explicit intentionality. It’s quick, potentially private and, for that reason, can be played off as ambiguous. It’s done with the eyes, which we might think are potentially leaking out truth and feeling. So there’s a potential for subversion of the social space in winking, by embedding a private moment that can’t be readily fact-checked. <strong>LaszloPanaflex</strong></p> <p>Because it enables you to apply mascara <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/readers-reply-why-cant-i-put-on-mascara-without-opening-my-mouth">without opening your mouth</a>? <strong>Paulo777</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/readers-reply-why-cant-i-put-on-mascara-without-opening-my-mouth">Readers reply: Why can’t I put on mascara without opening my mouth?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Winking, cheeky? Yes, when you do it your cheek moves up. So yes, cheeky. <strong>catchytitled</strong></p> <p>Ah yes, well, you see, English has developed mostly from East Frisian and is a Germanic language, as is German. Due to the existence of the North Sea, some of the word meanings have evolved in a slightly different manner.</p> <p>In German, the verb “winken” means to wave, predominantly to attract someone’s attention, including of course the “yoo-hoo I think you’re gorgeous” wave across a crowded beer hall, the discreet wave of “shall we meet later?” and the small wave in front of the mouth meaning “you can share my secret if you want”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, across the <em>Nordsee</em>, “winken” has evolved into winking, to which has been added a touch of so-called British understatement, thus causing a reduction of movement from the hand to a not-always-so-subtle movement of the muscles around one eye. Add the natural loucheness of some of Britons and we arrive at the present situation. A blazer, a cravat and the shirt collar outside complete the evolutionary process. <strong>bricklayersoption</strong></p>
