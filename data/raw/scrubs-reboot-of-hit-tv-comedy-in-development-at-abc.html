<p>The hit sitcom Scrubs is scheduled to return with a reboot in early development at ABC.</p> <p>Series creator Bill Lawrence is working on a new version of the hospital-set comedy with the original cast being targeted for a return. The show starred Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke and John C McGinley.</p> <p>Lawrence has an overall deal with competitor Warner Bros TV but it’s been reported that after negotiations, a Scrubs reboot would be considered a separate project so he would be allowed to work with 20th Television at ABC.</p> <p>“It would be so much fun [with] all my favorite people,” Braff <a href="https://www.etonline.com/interview-zach-braff-reveals-whats-holding-up-the-scrubs-reboot-exclusive-230398">said</a> of a potential reboot earlier this year. “We all still hang out. A lot of people who were on long shows say that, but it’s true. I was just on vacation with Sarah Chalke … I’m going to the beach with Bill next weekend. We’re all friends.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/02/zach-braff-i-used-to-think-everyone-must-be-this-anxious">Zach Braff: ‘I used to think everyone must be this anxious’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lawrence, who recently created the Vince Vaughn comedy drama Bad Monkey, has also spoken about it recently. “I’m open to it, and I don’t want to do it as a movie, but I’m definitely open to doing a couple more years of that show,” he <a href="https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/tv/scrubs-reunion-bill-lawrence-701277-20240806">said</a>. “It would not only be fun to see where the characters I used to love are now, but also to see what a young doctor nowadays looks like, as far as the kids coming in behind them, you know.”</p> <p>The original show ran on NBC for seven seasons and then on ABC for two more. It received 17 Emmy nominations and won two awards.</p> <p>Braff and Faison started a Scrubs podcast in 2020 called Fake Doctors, Real Friends. Braff also reunited with Lawrence with a role on his show Bad Monkey.</p> <p>The return would follow another relaunch of a hit network sitcom from the same era with The Office spin-off The Paper announced earlier this year. The new show, which entered production this past summer, will star Domhnall Gleeson and The White Lotus actor Sabrina Impacciatore.</p>
