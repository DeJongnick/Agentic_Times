<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court">US supreme court</a> on Friday allowed members of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to access the sensitive records kept by the Social Security Administration while legal challenges play out.</p> <p>The conservative-majority court, in an unsigned order with the three liberal justices dissenting, sided with the Trump administration in the appeal involving Doge, the team spearheaded by the billionaire <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>.</p> <p>The high court agreed to lift an injunction issued by a federal district court judge in Maryland, writing that the social security agency “may proceed” to grant members of the Doge team “access to the agency records in question in order for those members to do their work”.</p> <p>Doge, which was created by executive order and is not an official government department, slashed its way through federal agencies as part of its mission to end the “tyranny of the bureaucracy”. Musk stepped back from his government work last month and is now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/06/elon-musk-signals-he-may-back-down-in-public-row-with-donald-trump">publicly feuding</a> with Trump.</p> <p>The Trump administration said Doge needed access to the information to fulfill its goal of targeting waste and fraud in the federal government and saving taxpayer money.</p> <p>Musk had identified social security as an area he claimed was rife with fraud. The billionaire tech executive once said social security – which provides benefits to more than 70 million Americans, including retirees and disabled Americans – was “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time”. He and Trump have repeated inaccurate claims that millions of people born over a century ago are collecting social security checks.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/supreme-court-reverse-discrimination-case">US supreme court sides with heterosexual woman in ‘reverse discrimination’ case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Today, the court grants a stay permitting the government to give unfettered data access to Doge regardless – despite its failure to show any need or any interest in complying with existing privacy safeguards, and all before we know for sure whether federal law countenances such access,” Jackson wrote in her dissent.</p> <p>“The court is thereby, unfortunately, suggesting that what would be an extraordinary request for everyone else is nothing more than an ordinary day on the docket for this administration.”</p> <p>The lawsuit was brought by labor unions and an advocacy group, which sued to block Doge from accessing the agency’s databases, which store the personal information of nearly every American, including financial information, medical history and school records.</p> <p>“This is a sad day for our democracy and a scary day for millions of people,” Democracy Forward, which represents the plaintiffs, said. “This ruling will enable President Trump and Doge’s affiliates to steal Americans’ private and personal data. Elon Musk may have left Washington DC, but his impact continues to harm millions of people.</p> <p>“We will continue to use every legal tool at our disposal to keep unelected bureaucrats from misusing the public’s most sensitive data as this case moves forward.”</p> <p>In April, Judge Ellen Hollander, of the US district court for Maryland, imposed strict restrictions on access to the records, citing the agency’s “abiding commitment to the privacy and confidentiality of the personal information entrusted to it by the American people”.</p> <p>“For some 90 years, [the] SSA has been guided by the foundational principle of an expectation of privacy with respect to its records,” she wrote. “This case exposes a wide fissure in the foundation.”</p> <p>Her order directed Doge employees, and social security employees working with them, to “disgorge and delete” any personal information already in their possession.</p> <p>News that the Doge team had sought access to the data raised alarms among federal workers, privacy advocates and Democrats who charged that Musk could use the information to benefit his private companies. At town halls, many constituents demanded their elected leaders protect their data from Doge.</p>
