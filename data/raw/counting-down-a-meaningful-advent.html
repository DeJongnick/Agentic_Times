<p>I share Anne Abbott’s irritation (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/16/too-late-to-the-par-tay-to-correct-the-pronunciation-of-latte" title="">Letters</a>, 17 November) at the depressing and materialistic selection of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/16/ridiculous-rise-luxury-advent-calendars-500-pound-beauty-boxes-pork-scratchings-christmas" title="">advent calendars reviewed in G2</a> (16 November). However, the sort she yearns for does exist. The Meaningful Chocolate Company, an ethical trading company, produces a cheerful and affordable one featuring the true Christmas story, and including an excellent children’s story and activity booklet with a page for every day in advent. Money from sales goes to support the Funzi and Bodo Trust in equipping a clinic in Kenya. These can be obtained at cathedral shops, some major supermarkets, and elsewhere. Details on <a href="http://www.realadvent.co.uk/" title="">www.realadvent.co.uk</a> and <a href="https://meaningfulchocolate.co.uk/" title="">www.meaningfulchocolate.co.uk</a>. My lovely German daughter-in-law annually hand-crafts a beautiful advent calendar for our grandchildren, but we still always buy Meaningful Chocolate’s for our adult sons and daughters-in-law, knowing the booklets will go to their children (even if the chocolates don’t.).<br><strong>Anne Johns</strong><br><em>Derby</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Join the debate – email </em></strong><a href="mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com" title=""><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>• Read more Guardian letters – </em></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters" title=""><strong><em>click here to visit gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>
