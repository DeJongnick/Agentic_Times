<p>What if you could buy architect-designed drawings for a new home for $1 – and have certainty your council would approve it within 10 to 20 days?</p> <p>The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, <a href="https://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/government-architect-nsw/housing-design/nsw-housing-pattern-book">released the state’s housing pattern book on Wednesday</a>, which contains eight blueprints for architect-designed townhouses, terraces and manor houses, chosen from internationally renowned firms including <a href="https://samcrawfordarchitects.com.au/">Sam Crawford Architects</a>, <a href="https://www.carterwilliamson.com/">Carter Williamson Architects</a>, <a href="https://www.saha.sydney/#studio">Saha </a>and <a href="https://gillarchitects.com.au/">Anthony Gill Architects</a>.</p> <p>The designs, which will be available for $1 for the first six months and then for $1,000, can be adjusted to fit a family’s needs and are designed with sustainability, ease of construction and cost-effectiveness in mind. By comparison, getting custom architectural plans can cost upwards of $20,000.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/13/great-job-good-education-no-home-is-australias-bloated-property-market-destroying-the-middle-class">Great job, good education, no home: is Australia’s bloated property market destroying the middle class?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The plans are intended to boost the state’s sluggish housing construction rates and help alleviate cost-of-living pressures.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The book comes after a 2024 competition that sought designs for denser types of development, such as terrace houses and duplexes.</p> <p>Under the Minns government’s changes to zoning laws, these denser developments can now be built in areas within 800 metres from transport and shopping hubs without complicated approval processes.</p>      <p>The Guardian understands the designs will be eligible to be submitted in an application for a complying development certificate (CDC), which means for the most part they are approved within 10 to 20 days by councils, with much less paperwork and less consultation with neighbours.</p> <p>However, the details of the fast-track process are still being worked out with local councils.</p> <p>“For too long, too many people in NSW have been locked out of the housing market by rising cost and a system that made it too hard to build. We’re changing that,” Minns said.</p> <p>“This pattern book is about giving people more choice, faster approvals, and affordable, high-quality homes – whether you’re a young person trying to get in, a family needing more space, or a downsizer looking to stay close to the community you know.”</p>    <p>Paul Scully, the minister for planning and public spaces, said: “Much of Sydney was built on pattern books. They look great, they’re simple and cost-effective.”</p> <p>Sam Crawford, director of <a href="https://samcrawfordarchitects.com.au/">Sam Crawford Architects</a>, said the pattern book had the potential to “democratise good design”.</p> <p>“Our inspiration was the Paddington terrace – taking the great things about it and adapting it to the needs of the 21st century.”</p> <p>His firm’s design features flow between spaces, wider hallways for accessibility and a garage at the back. The garage is able to be adapted to a studio or a ground-level bedroom, depending on the owner’s needs.</p>    <p>Harry Catterns, a partner at Saha, said his firm produced a design for a town house, with the idea of creating a mini-house that could be built in fours on a block.</p> <p>“It’s like a town-home or mews,” he said. “Every house has a front door and its own yard, which would be attractive for a young family. It’s designed to be repeated and modular, so it will suit prefab building as well as simple traditional building.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/nov/19/when-bigger-isnt-better-do-australian-houses-need-to-be-the-largest-in-the-world">When bigger isn’t better: do Australian houses need to be the largest in the world?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Crawford said he expected that using the pattern book designs would be cheaper to construct compared with bespoke architect-designed builds but probably not cheaper than a project home.</p> <p>One government official put the savings in building costs at between 5% and 17%.</p> <p>The designs are expected to be used predominantly in infill development in developed suburbs, but could also be rolled out in greenfield areas.</p> <p>The designs will also come with a landscape guide which offer advice on appropriate native plans and designs depending on the latitude of the site.</p>
