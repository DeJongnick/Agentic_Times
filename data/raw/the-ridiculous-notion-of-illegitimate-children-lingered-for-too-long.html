<p>Ideas of “illegitimacy” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/17/cruel-legacy-of-irelands-mother-and-baby-homes">Letters, 17 April</a>) remained potent for some at least as late as the 1990s. When I registered my firstborn, I refused to say whether I was married and insisted my partner’s name also go on the certificate. The registrar, horrified, told me: “But then your child will be registered as illegitimate!” I had to point out to her that illegitimacy had not been a legal category for some time. But I didn’t tell her that I’d been born in a mother-and-baby home. I found her words ridiculous, but they could as easily have been an unnecessary (and inaccurate) cruelty.<br><strong>Naomi Standen</strong><br><em>Birmingham</em></p> <p>• As the 1 May local elections near, Nigel Farage’s campaign is featured in every media outlet.
