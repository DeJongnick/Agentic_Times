<h2>How to be a manly man, according to Zuck</h2> <p>Please excuse my “feminine energy” for a moment while I give a dainty little shudder. My delicate constitution, you see, has been terribly disturbed by the overpowering masculine energy of two very manly men: Mark Zuckerberg and Joe Rogan. The Meta CEO appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast recently for a very long chat and there was so much testosterone in that studio it’s a wonder the walls didn’t explode.</p> <p>If you are in a masochistic sort of mood and have almost three hours that you’d like to never get back, then feel free to go and listen to the podcast yourself. But the too-long-didn’t-listen highlight is that the Meta CEO reckons that the business world has got a little <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mark-zuckerberg-masculine-energy/">bit too feminine</a>. Zuckerberg, who built his media empire by making a website to <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a19746346/mark-zuckerberg-testifying-congress-facesmash-facebook/">rank women’s looks</a> and called his first users “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/17/facebook-people-first-ever-mark-zuckerberg-harvard">dumb fucks</a>” for trusting him, thinks corporations should celebrate “aggression” more. Corporations, according to Zuck, have been “neutered” and need more “masculine energy”. He then went on to say that while “feminine energy” is good, corporate culture had swung too far that way and should reclaim its masculinity.</p> <p>What exactly is “masculine energy” anyway? Other than a woo-woo way to talk about old-fashioned ideas about gender roles, I mean? The Meta CEO didn’t define its parameters, but I have helpfully done some digging and compiled a quick guide to boosting your masculine energy in five Zuck-approved steps.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/11/los-angeles-wildfires-diversity">In utterly unsurprising news, Maga blames diversity for the Los Angeles wildfires | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Thicken your neck. </strong>At one point during their conversation Rogan stops to admire Zuck’s neck which, apparently, is a lot bigger than it used to be. (I can’t say I’ve noticed but that’s probably because I’ve been distracted by the tech guru’s more general street-chic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/28/mark-zuckeberg-revamps-public-image-style">metamorphosis</a>.) The pair went on to talk about how important a strong neck is for martial arts, which is one of the billionaire’s passions, and Zuckerberg says he’s worked hard on his neck so he doesn’t hurt his brain while fighting. “I’m going to be running [Meta] for a while,” <a href="https://www.happyscribe.com/public/the-joe-rogan-experience/2255-mark-zuckerberg?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Zuck explains</a>, “and the number one thing you need to do in addition to having great partners is have a strong neck.” OK.</p> <p><strong>2. Fawn over thin-skinned presidents. </strong>Thick necks are important for fighting, but they’re also a must-have when you’ve made a habit of bowing down to Donald Trump the way that Zuckerberg has. Otherwise you’re liable to get a nasty crick in your neck from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/11/why-mark-zuckerberg-turned-to-dana-white-to-secure-magas-favor">bending over</a> to kiss the ring so much! While Zuck was once in Trump’s bad books, he’s now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/07/ditching-facebook-factcheckers-major-step-back-public-discourse">rejigged Meta’s structure</a> to be more Trump-friendly, and flattered the incoming president so extensively that the pair seem to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/03/trump-administration-mark-zuckerberg">on their way</a> to becoming BFFs. I didn’t realize masculine energy involved quite so much sucking up but I guess the manly Mr Mark is the expert here, isn’t he?</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Kill some wild pigs. </strong>Zuckerberg likes to kill the feral pigs in Hawaii with a bow and arrow while <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/voices/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-masculinity-b2681520.html">Rogan likes to use a rifle</a>. The pair had a riveting conversation about the merits of each method.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Throw your former female colleagues under the bus. </strong>Last September, Zuckerberg said one of the biggest regrets of his career was apologizing too much and taking responsibility for things he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-says-hes-done-apologizing/">didn’t think he was responsible for</a>. Now he seems to be living by the ethos that a real man never accepts responsibility. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html">New York Times recently reported</a> that during a meeting between Zuckerberg and top Trump advisers – including Stephen Miller – “Mr Zuckerberg blamed his former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, for an inclusivity initiative at Facebook that encouraged employees’ self-expression in the workplace.” Zuck said he would undo all that rubbish and, according to the Times, made clear “he would do nothing to obstruct the Trump agenda”.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Find a posse of other manly men to hang out with. </strong>Rumour has it that<strong> </strong>Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg might <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/15/musk-bezos-zuckerberg-trump-inauguration">all sit together at Trump’s inauguration</a>. Which would be very cute, wouldn’t it? The Three Musk-eteers, all exuding masculine energy together. Maybe Musk and Zuck can finally have that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/16/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-cage-fight">cage-fighting competition</a> they keep talking about. Bezos can referee.</p> <p>While the tips above will help you up your masculine energy, the most important component of Zuck’s real-man-rulebook appears to be ignoring any facts that contradict your worldview. After all, do you know what didn’t come up in Zuckerberg’s lament about the corporate world being too feminine? The fact that, <a href="https://www.theceomagazine.com/business/management-leadership/countries-with-the-most-female-ceos/">for several years</a>, there were more men called “John” leading major companies than female S&amp;P 500 CEOs. The fact that, as of August 2024, women ran 5.6% of businesses on <a href="https://fortune.com/ranking/global500/2024/">the Global 500</a> – down from 5.8% a year before. In the Fortune 500, which measures the largest US-based companies by revenue, things are a bit better, but (as of June last year) <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/share-fortune-500-companies-run-113000264.html">only 10.4% of CEOs were women</a>. The facts would seem to suggest that there is still plenty of masculine energy in corporate America. But, as Zuckerberg has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/10/mark-zuckerberg-meta-factchecking">made very clear</a> recently, factchecking is very last season.</p> <h2>Italian soccer club Lazio fires falconer over penis implant posts</h2> <p>“Lazio fired the far-right sympathiser who handles their eagle mascot on Monday after he posted a series of videos and pictures of his erect penis online,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/14/lazio-fire-far-right-eagle-mascot-handler-over-his-social-media-penis-posts">the Guardian explains</a>.

The fancy word for this is “matrilocality”. The study is a reminder that there’s no such thing as “traditional” gender roles – an idea that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/08/the-patriarchs-by-angela-saini-review-the-roots-of-male-domination">Angela Saini’s The Patriarchs</a> explores in depth. “By thinking about gendered inequality as rooted in something unalterable within us, we fail to see it for what it is,” Saini writes, “something more fragile that has had to be constantly remade and reasserted.”</p> <h2>Why there’s no big Women’s March this Trump inauguration</h2> <p>“The crushing defeat of Kamala Harris … has left liberal women exhausted and laid bare racial divides in the women’s rights movements that will take some time to heal,” activists and organizers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/why-theres-no-big-womens-march-before-this-trump-inauguration-2025-01-17/">told Reuters</a>.</p> <h2>How the state department let Israel get away with horrors in Gaza</h2> <p>ProPublica has <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/biden-blinken-state-department-israel-gaza-human-rights-horrors">done a must-read deep dive</a> into how the US enabled what one senior official at the state department has described as “the human rights atrocity of our time”.</p> <h2>I knew one day I’d have to watch powerful men burn the world down – I just didn’t expect them to be such losers</h2> <p>I’m a big fan of Rebecca Shaw’s hilarious writing and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/16/i-knew-one-day-id-have-to-watch-powerful-men-burn-the-world-down-i-just-didnt-expect-them-to-be-such-losers">this latest piece</a> skewering the axis of cringe that is Musk-Zuckerberg-Trump is *chef’s kiss*.</p> <h2>The week in pawtriarchy</h2> <p>If you’ve ever wondered whether dogs watch TV, the Guardian has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/17/can-dogs-watch-tv">reviewed the science</a> and the answer is: sort of. Dogs tend to watch TV because they’re “checking if it’s real”, and seem to enjoy watching other dogs best. Dog owners have also reported their dogs are more likely to watch action and sci-fi content with them.
