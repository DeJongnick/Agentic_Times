<p>When Jane was quoted about $20,000 to get the power put back on at her mother’s property, she balked.</p> <p>“He said the whole house needs to be rewired,” Jane said. “He had the iPad out and said ‘I’ll need you to sign here’. I know my mum doesn’t have that kind of money. I asked why it would cost so much.</p> <p>“They said something like ‘This quote will expire, you need to sign now or we can’t get started and you won’t have electricity.’”</p> <p>Jane, who didn’t want her real name used, didn’t cave to the urgency. Instead, she got someone else to do the job<strong> </strong>for about $3,500.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/09/building-commission-nsw-using-old-parking-infringement-notice-books-to-fine-builders-and-developers">Building Commission NSW using old parking infringement notice books to fine builders and developers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Jane is furious that had she not been there, her 78-year-old mother would have faced the pressure. </p> <p><strong>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p> <p>Consumer groups and state government authorities around the country have warned of a variety of concerning practices and tactics by tradespeople, including:</p> <ul> <li><p>Targeting vulnerable, often older people, or those affected by natural disasters.</p></li> <li><p>Fearmongering by pretending a problem is urgent and potentially disastrous.</p></li> <li><p>Using threatening behaviour to coerce people.</p></li> <li><p>Overcharging and upselling unnecessary work.</p></li> <li><p>Operating under dozens, even hundreds of names to influence internet search results, hiding from bad reviews and providing multiple quotes that appear to be from different companies.</p></li> </ul> <p>The company Jane asked to quote trades under almost 200 names across all states and territories and offers a range of services including hot water repair and electrical work.</p> <p>The Council on the Ageing Australia says it has had “troubling reports” about tradies targeting older people.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, older people are targeted as they’re more likely to be home during the day, and these scammers are quick to take advantage of this,” the council’s acting chief executive, Corey Irlam, said.</p> <p>“If someone shows up unannounced, uses high-pressure tactics, or demands upfront payment for a job, that’s a red flag.”</p> <p>The New South Wales government has warned about “unlicensed trades and scams” after floods. Building Commission NSW has received 157 reports of unlicensed or unregistered trade work since the beginning of 2025.</p> <p>This month, Consumer Protection Western Australia said “dodgy door knockers” were targeting homes to carry out “shoddy roof repairs”.</p> <p>“These con men move from town to town using high-pressure tactics to push overpriced roof restoration jobs – often delivering little to no actual work,” the agency said.</p> <p>One elderly couple was approached by two men who said their roof needed repairs. The men began the job without a formal quote and the couple were told to deposit an $18,645 cheque. Another couple was “coerced” into paying $2,145 “while the man stood over them during the bank transfer”, the agency said.</p> <p>The agency also warned about “rogue elements” in plumbing and electrical trades who “exaggerate necessity for extra work and costs”.</p> <p>The South Australian consumer and business affairs minister, Andrea Michaels, said the department had fielded numerous complaints where “customers feel they have been quoted excessive amounts, feel they have been told they need work done that they do not, or feel they have been pressured into agreeing to high-priced work”.</p> <p>Examples provided included $1,000 to fix a leaking tap; $1,000 for a valve that another plumber said should have cost $90; an elderly customer charged $2,500 for an air conditioning part worth less than $100; and more than $2,000 to replace a shower head.</p> <p>In another case, according to Michaels, a customer was charged $10,000 to unblock a drain and install replacement concrete, but was then advised by another plumber that the concrete work was not needed and the drain could be unblocked for a few hundred dollars.</p>    <p>Earlier this month Queensland’s Office of Fair Trading warned some tradies with a “blatant disregard for the law” were taking large sums of money without providing the promised goods and services.</p>    <p>Consumer Affairs Victoria said “fake tradies” or “travelling con men” might offer to do work then “disappear with your money, leaving unfinished or substandard work, if they start work at all”. </p> <p>The Master Plumbers Association (SA) chief executive officer, Andrew Clarke, said people looking for a tradie should ask family or friends for recommendations. Searching on an industry association website instead of trusting search engines was also a good idea, he said.</p> <p>“If you’re using a member of an association, you then have the right to complain to the association,” he said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cbs.sa.gov.au/campaigns/beware-rogue-tradespeople">Experts say</a> people should seek multiple quotes – ensuring they’re from genuinely different companies – check licensing and accreditation of tradies and resist pressure to sign contracts even in emergency situations.</p> <p>Jane said she had dealt with hundreds of maintenance people in her life, but the experience with her mother’s house was different.</p> <p>“They were basically in my face trying to get me to sign,” she said.</p> <p>“What if my mum, not understanding, signed on the iPad? She would have been up for a massive bill.</p> <p>“They’re taking advantage of vulnerable people.”</p> <p>• Do you know more? Contact tory.shepherd@theguardian.com</p>
