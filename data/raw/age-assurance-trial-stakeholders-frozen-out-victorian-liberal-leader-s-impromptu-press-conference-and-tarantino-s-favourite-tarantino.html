<p>Good afternoon. The organisation behind the age assurance technology trial that will inform how to keep under-16s off social media <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/19/australia-age-assurance-trial-social-media-ban-leaks-resignations">has iced out key stakeholders</a> after media leaks and resignations of two members.</p> 
<p>Iain Corby, the executive director of the Age Verification Providers Association, has also downplayed reporting about inaccuracies with the facial estimation technology – one of the technologies tested in the trial – arguing that it can still be used even if it is out by seven years.</p> 
<p>The trial, run by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS), tested out various types of technology that could be used by social media platforms and adult websites to keep out under-16s or under-18s, respectively, when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/01/how-australia-under-16s-social-media-ban-enforced-tiktok-instagram-facebook-exempt-platforms">Australia’s ban comes into force in December</a>.</p> 
<p>The project provided its final report to the communications minister, Anika Wells, at the start of August. However, the stakeholder advisory board for the trial – which comprises tech companies, child safety advocates, academics and privacy advocates – may not see the final report until Wells releases it publicly in the coming weeks.</p>
