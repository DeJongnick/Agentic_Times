<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/31/can-you-solve-it-the-pals-that-broke-the-internet-ten-years-on">Earlier today </a>I set you the following problem featuring Albert, Bernard and Cheryl, the protagonists in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/apr/13/can-you-solve-the-singapore-primary-maths-question-that-went-viral">viral puzzle from a decade ago</a>. Here it is again with the solution.</p> <p><strong>Cheryl’s house number problem</strong></p> <p>Cheryl: I have thought of two distinct one-digit numbers. The last digit of the product of the two numbers is the last digit of Bernard’s house number. What is the sum of these two numbers?</p> <p>Albert: I do not know what Bernard’s house number is.</p> <p>Bernard: I know my house number, of course, and I know what the sum of the two numbers is.</p> <p>Albert: At first, I did not know what the sum of the two numbers is, but now I know.</p> <p>What is the sum of the two numbers?</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong> 10</p> <p>Let Cheryl’s two numbers be <em>a </em>and <em>b</em>. Here is a table of possible values for the final digit of <em>ab</em>, with the possible pairs whose product has that final digit, and the possible sums <em>a </em>+ <em>b </em>.</p>    <p>Say Bernard’s house number ends in 2. Cheryl may have thought of 1 and 2 (1 x 2 = 2), or 3 and 4 (3 x 4 = 12), or 8 and 9 (8 x 9 = 72). So the sum <em>a </em>+ <em>b </em>could be 3, 7, 17 etc. Bernard cannot know with 100 per cent certainty the value of <em>a </em>+ <em>b.</em></p> <p>The only time Bernard can know the sum is when there is only one possibility for <em>a </em>+ <em>b</em>. If you look at the table, the only time <em>a </em>+ <em>b</em> is unique is when the last digit is 1 or 9. In both cases, the sum is 10.</p> <p>At the end of the process we do not know Cheryl’s numbers. We just know their sum.</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed the puzzle – I’ll be back in two weeks.</p> <p><em>If you want to see the solution for the Cheryl’s birthday problem, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/apr/13/how-to-solve-albert-bernard-and-cheryls-birthday-maths-problem">click here.</a></em></p> <p><em>Thanks to Joseph Yeo for today’s puzzle.</em></p> <p><em>I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015.
