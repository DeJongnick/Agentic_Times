Why? Despite the drop in US equities, the dollar has failed to rally. Dollar weakness this year has been additive rather than offsetting to underlying asset losses. It is clear from our conversations with real money investors that the risk-reducing properties of unhedged dollar exposure have played a key part in portfolio allocation over the last decade. When “bad things” happen the dollar tends to rally, so unhedged US risky assets have proven a highly attractive portfolio diversifier. Yet this is now changing.</p> <p>We argued a few days ago that it is the idiosyncratic downward repricing of US fiscal, growth, and Fed expectations that is causing the dollar to weaken alongside US equities. Broader rhetoric that challenges the international rule of law may also be undermining dollar safe-haven perception. If this correlation breakdown between US equities and the dollar continues, it will open up a more structural discussion among European (and global) asset managers on the diversification benefits of unhedged risky-asset dollar exposure. Some press reports suggest this may already be starting. By extension, a sizeable net reduction of dollar exposure would be on the cards.</p> <p>We have for a long time not been believers in the concept of a new (say, Mar-A-Lago) currency accord to weaken the dollar. We do believe that policy that undermines the economic soundness of the dollar would achieve the same thing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-03-14T11:01:36.517Z">at 11.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-67d3efe58f08b5dc8f13bac8" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-03-14T08:59:42.571Z">8.59am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Brexit continues to hurt the UK economy.</strong></p> <p>British food and drink exports to the EU have tumbled by more than a third since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum">Brexit</a>, according to new trade body figures highlighting how bureaucratic barriers have changed the relationship between the UK and its most important trading partner.</p> <p>Products including whisky, chocolate and cheese remain popular with EU customers but overall food export volumes to the bloc fell to 6.37bn kg in 2024, representing a 34% decline compared with 2019 levels, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) found.</p> <p>While some of the fall in exports since the UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/27/brexit-explained-how-it-happened-and-what-comes-next">left the union in January 2020</a> can be attributed to global events including the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the FDF’s latest trade snapshot reveals other European countries including the Netherlands, Germany and Italy have increased their export volumes since 2020.
