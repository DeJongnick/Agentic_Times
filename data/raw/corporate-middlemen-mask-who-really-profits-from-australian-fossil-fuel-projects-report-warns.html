<p>Three global banks are being paid to obscure who profits from 51 fossil fuel projects in Australia that produce 22m tonnes of carbon emissions each year, according to new analysis.</p> <p>An analyst who authored the report says it highlights a “massive problem” in Australia that could be reducing the amount of scrutiny investors face for financial support of the fossil fuel industry.</p> <p>US-based research group Global Energy Monitor (GEM) investigated the dominance of nominee companies in Australia, which are paid to be listed as shareholders on behalf of unnamed investors.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/22/fossil-fuels-coal-gas-oil-extraction-climate-goals-beyond-reach">Nations’ plans to ramp up coal, gas and oil extraction ‘will put climate goals beyond reach’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It found nominees were listed as major shareholders in 25 publicly listed energy firms in Australia, which collectively account for nearly 18% of the nation’s fossil fuel emissions.</p>    <p>“Nominee companies are middlemen in corporate ownership: They hold shares in name only, masking the identity of the actual owners,” said the report by GEM research analyst Gabe Louis.</p> <p>“This makes it incredibly difficult to pinpoint who is the actual shareholder. With no rules on nominee companies, fossil fuel backers can profit while staying hidden from public scrutiny.”</p> <p>The report found almost all nominees in Australia were subsidiaries of the world’s largest banks.</p> <p>It found three nominees, subsidiaries of Citibank, HSBC and JP Morgan, were listed as shareholders in companies producing carbon emissions roughly equivalent to the output of 4.4m Australian homes each year.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/01/australia-could-split-cop31-hosting-rights-with-turkey-under-potential-compromise">Australia could split Cop31 hosting rights with Turkey under potential compromise</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The report found nominees were listed as owners of close to 70% of Origin Energy’s shares, two-thirds of Whitehaven Coal’s shares, and more than a third of AGL Energy’s shares.</p> <p>“Because shareholders can exercise voting rights and benefit financially, understanding these ownership structures provides a clearer picture of which actors are connected to Australia’s fossil fuel sector,” Louis said.</p> <p>“While there’s a lot the Australian government will need to do to hit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/18/how-australia-plans-to-reach-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2050">its new climate target</a>, making the ownership of fossil fuel interests more transparent is a low-hanging fruit.”</p> <p>Jenifer Varzaly, an associate professor in commercial law at Durham University who has investigated nominee companies in Australia, said they may provide a “cloaking mechanism” for some investors.</p> <p>In Australia, companies must disclose the names of investors that hold more than 5% of shares. But Varzaly said if the shareholding hovered below that 5% threshold, and was listed in the name of a nominee, then “the public will not know who sits behind it”.</p> <p>While close to 70% of Origin’s shares are held by nominees linked to JP Morgan, HSBC and Citibank, others nominees are listed as owning tens of thousands of shares in the company but less than the 5% threshold.</p> <p>Transparency International Australia’s chief executive, Clancy Moore, agreed nominee companies could “mask the true owners of corporate structures in Australia”.</p> <p>“With a draft bill in parliament, the Albanese government is taking the first steps in lifting the veil on corporate ownership in Australia,” Moore said.</p> <p>“But more needs to be done to create a centralised, publicly accessible register of who ultimately owns and benefits from private and public companies in Australia.”</p> <p>Legislation introduced to parliament last month would increase corporate transparency by creating a register of beneficial owners. But the legislation does not specifically address the issue of nominees.</p> <p>The Greens spokesperson for economic justice, Nick McKim, said nominees “were letting coal, oil and gas profiteers cash in from the shadows”.</p> <p>McKim said the Financial Action Task Force, a multilateral organisation that sets standards for corporate transparency, recently found Australia generally was only “partially compliant” with its recommendations on corporate transparency.</p> <p>“If we had a public beneficial ownership register with teeth, nominee companies would be redundant,” McKim said.</p> <p>In the UK, nominee companies that hold more than 25% of a company’s shares must disclose who is benefiting. This is not required in Australia.</p> <p>Nominee companies are not exclusively used to mask investments in the fossil fuel sector. Close to 70% of shares in Australian pharmaceutical company CSL are registered with nominees, according to its latest annual report. About 90% of shares in property developer Mirvac are listed as being nominee companies.</p> <p>Nominee companies also provide other services to investors including transaction settlement, administration and financial reporting.</p> <p>Treasury, the treasurer’s office, Citibank, HSBC and JP Morgan were contacted for comment.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
