<p>The man alleged to have masterminded a spate of antisemitic attacks in Sydney and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/10/a-sydney-caravan-laden-with-explosives-was-a-fake-terrorism-plot-heres-what-we-know-ntwnfb">“fake terrorism” caravan plot</a> has denied responsibility – but admits he was involved in having the caravan moved.</p> <p>In January, police discovered a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/29/caravan-laden-with-explosives-found-in-sydney-allegedly-intended-for-antisemitic-attack-ntwnfb">caravan packed with explosives</a> in the outer Sydney suburb of Dural, triggering a massive multi agency investigation.</p> <p>Former gym owner and alleged drug dealer Sayit Akca <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-05/dural-caravan-explosive-antisemitic-allege-mastermind-sayit-akca/105244318">has told Four Corners</a> he was able to divert the caravan – which he says was being moved between an illicit buyer and seller – and informed the Australian federal police (AFP) about the explosives in an attempt to gain more lenient treatment in the courts.</p> <p>Akca was charged in 2022 with conspiring to import a commercial quantity of illicit drugs and recklessly engaging with the proceeds of crime. He did not attend a scheduled court appearance at Sydney’s Downing Centre local court on 28 September 2023.

He denied any knowledge of a note listing Jewish community targets that New South Wales police alleged was found inside the caravan.</p> <p>“I actually picked Dural and I just told the driver … to just put it in a safe spot,” Akca said, according to the ABC.</p> <p>In the months before the discovery of the caravan – which the NSW premier, Chris Minns, initially said was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/29/caravan-laden-with-explosives-found-in-sydney-allegedly-intended-for-antisemitic-attack-ntwnfb">capable of being a “mass casualty event”</a> – Sydney and its large Jewish community were rocked by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/02/sydney-is-facing-a-wave-of-antisemitic-attacks-but-what-is-behind-them">spate of firebombing and graffiti attacks</a>, including on a childcare centre and synagogues.</p> <p>In March, police said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/10/sydney-antisemitic-caravan-plan-fake-terrorism-plot-nsw-police-ntwnfb">the caravan was part of a “fake terrorism plot”</a> allegedly orchestrated by organised criminals for personal gain.

And then there’s a bunch of other things they’re alleging was me. But I deny it. Doesn’t match my timeline”.</p> <p>After supplying the AFP with further information about explosives as part of his bid for leniency, Akca gave up on the hope of returning to Australia, he told Four Corners.</p> <p>In April, it emerged that a senior NSW police officer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/07/sydney-dural-caravan-fake-terrorism-plot-nsw-police-officer-signed-nda-with-afp-ntwnfb">signed a non-disclosure agreement</a> when told by the AFP in early February that the motivation of the “mastermind” behind Sydney’s fake terrorism caravan plot was to influence prosecutions.</p> <p>The AFP said on Monday that it questioned “the motivation of the individual interviewed by Four Corners”.</p> <p>“That person has been charged by the AFP for an alleged illicit drug importation, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment,” an AFP spokesperson said.</p> <p>“That person is also accused of unlawfully leaving Australia while on bail.”</p> <p>On Monday, NSW police told Guardian Australia: “Operation Kissinger is an investigation by the joint counter-terrorism team (JCTT) comprising members of NSW police force, Australian federal police, NSW crime commission and Asio.</p> <p>“The NSW police force is committed to preventing and disrupting any threat to the safety and wellbeing of the community and has been working collaboratively with our partner agencies under JCTT arrangements to investigate terrorist activities, since its establishment in 2002.”</p> <p>NSW police said a number of people connected to the investigation had been charged and were before the courts, and, for “operational reasons”, would not comment further.</p> <p>Guardian Australia contacted Akca for comment.</p>
