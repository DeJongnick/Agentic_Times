The CMA is particularly concerned about roofing contracts.</p> <p>The regulator, led by chief executive Sarah Cardell, did not name any of the companies under investigation. It has carried out surprise inspections at several business premises to gather evidence, including physical and digital documents. It is working closely with the Department for Eduction (DfE).</p> <p>CIF money is awarded every year by the DfE and can involve significant sums of money. During the latest round, it made available almost £450m in funding. Funds are awarded to schools with buildings in poor condition, to address health and safety issues, as well as building compliance.</p> <p><strong>Juliette Enser</strong>, the watchdog’s executive director of competition enforcement, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This fund is incredibly important and ensures that essential building improvements can be made to schools throughout England, meaning students are learning in safe and suitable environments.</p> <p>While no assumptions should be made that competition law has been broken at this early stage, we will be investigating this issue thoroughly. We will now be making enquiries and assessing the evidence to see whether or not bid rigging has taken place – and what further action may be needed.</p> </blockquote>    <p>If the CMA decides that the companies have broken competition law, after assessing the evidence gathered, it will issue what is known as a statement of objections to set out its concerns, and businesses have an opportunity to respond. At this stage, no assumptions should be made that the law has been broken, the watchdog said.</p> <p>Public procurement represents around a third of public spending and evidence from around the world suggests it is highly vulnerable to anti-competitive behaviour.</p> <p>Last year, the CMA issued fines totalling almost £60m to firms involved in rigging both public and private sector bids.</p> <p>The latest investigation comes ahead of the new debarment regime, which is set to come into force in February. This means that any businesses which break competition law could also be banned from bidding on public contracts in the future – in addition to potential financial penalties and director disqualification.</p> <p>A business that has been involved in anti-competitive conduct may be granted immunity from penalties, or a significant reduction in penalty, in return for reporting cartel activity and assisting the regulator with its investigation. Individuals involved in cartel activity may also be granted immunity from criminal prosecution if they help the CMA.
