<p>At least 70 people have died in northern China after another bout of torrential rain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/china-floods-flooding-beijing-thousands-evacuated">triggered flooding</a>, the latest in a series of extreme rainfall events in recent months. Between 23 and 29 July, Beijing and its surrounding areas recorded an average of 166mm, equivalent to the monthly norm.</p> 
<p>The suburban district of Miyun received the highest amount of rainfall, with 543mm recorded, equivalent to the region’s annual average. The death toll included 31 people in a Miyun care home, 10 who were swept away in a minibus in Shanxi province, and eight people in a landslide in the city of Chengde.</p> 
<p>Floods also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/31/chinese-official-rare-admission-failings-deadly-beijing-floods">damaged roads and vital infrastructure</a>, cutting off more than 130 rural villages and leading to the evacuation of more than 80,000 people from their homes.</p> 
<p>The increasing frequency of high-rainfall events in China has been linked to rising global temperatures; each degree in warming enables the atmosphere to hold 7% more moisture.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Japan is braced for Tropical Storm Krosa on Friday, which is expected to skirt past the south-eastern Kanto region via the Izu islands. Although Krosa travelled towards Japan during its initial north-westerly path, a forecasted change to a more north-easterly direction means the system is likely to avoid a direct hit. However, its close proximity to the Chiba region may bring 120-200mm of rain in 24 hours.</p> 
<p>This week, as much of Europe experiences below-average temperatures, parts of Scandinavia have been engulfed by unusually intense heat. Prolonged heatwave conditions swept the north of the continent in mid-July, driven by exceptionally high sea-surface temperatures off Norway’s northern coast and a stubborn area of high pressure that brought sunny weather and sinking, compressing air.</p> 
<p>As a result, temperatures in Norway, Sweden and Finland rose 8-10C (46-40F) above seasonal norms and remained elevated for nearly two weeks. The Norwegian counties of Trøndelag and Nordland exceeded 30C for 13 consecutive days, including in Storforsheia, just north of the Arctic Circle. It was the warmest two-week period on record in several areas.</p> 
<p>In the past week, the heat has shifted north and east, easing across much of Norway and Sweden and pushing temperatures 10-15C above normal in Finland and north-western Russia. Temperatures in the upper 20s celsius are likely to persist for at least the next five days several hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle.</p>
