<p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted position: </strong>1st (NB: this is not necessarily Andy Hunter’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)</p> <p><strong>Last season’s position: </strong>1st</p> <h2>Prospects</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/liverpool-kit/giv-32554AMrkbs0jsaFf" data-alt="Liverpool kits"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/liverpool-kit/giv-32554AMrkbs0jsaFf">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Champions for a record-equalling 20th time, and by a comfortable margin, first-choice transfer targets secured in an ambitious recruitment drive and the possibility of Alexander Isak arriving too: Liverpool look in outstanding shape to celebrate their 21st title this season. A seventh Champions League triumph will also be considered a realistic target by Arne Slot.</p> <p>Expectations are high at Anfield but any analysis of the club must consider the immeasurable impact of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/03/diogo-jota-liverpool-portugal-footballer-dies-aged-28-car-crash">Diogo Jota’s tragic death</a> on teammates and colleagues. It is the unknown factor in their title defence.</p> <p>On paper Liverpool have upgraded the squad that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/27/liverpool-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">won the Premier League</a> with four matches to spare and handed Slot greater depth and versatility for his second season. The head coach rotated sparingly in the league and his approach was rewarded handsomely. Slot, however, felt that fatigue caught up with the team during a sequence of 30 matches between November and March and he should have made more changes for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/16/newcastle-sink-liverpool-to-savour-taste-of-glory-after-decades-of-drought">Carabao Cup final defeat by Newcastle</a>. Expect more rotation this season.</p> <p>Liverpool have added pace in both full-back positions with the signings of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/20/liverpool-agree-deal-to-sign-milos-kerkez-from-bournemouth-for-40m">Milos Kerkez</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/15/liverpool-negotiating-jeremie-frimpong-transfer-with-bayer-leverkusen">Jeremie Frimpong</a>, two parts of a statement transfer window when they spent almost £300m. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/23/liverpool-sign-hugo-ekitike-79m-deal-fending-off-late-manchester-united-bid">Hugo Ekitiké</a> was signed from under Newcastle’s noses after a breakthrough season with Eintracht Frankfurt and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/20/florian-wirtz-liverpool-bayer-leverkusen-club-record-116m-deal">coveted Florian Wirtz arrived for a club record</a> – and potentially British record – fee. Slot believes the Germany international will bring “a few extra weapons” to the side. Rich in attacking options, Liverpool by contrast appear light in central defence and will require another imperious campaign from Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté. The pair were a formidable unit last season. The defending champions appear the same.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/SRU92/1/" data-alt="How they finished in the past five seasons"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/SRU92/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>The manager</h2> <p>There is a stark contrast between the character of the Liverpool head coach and the manager he succeeded last summer but, thanks to his tactical brilliance and calm, grounded manner, Slot exceeded expectations in evolving the squad built by Jürgen Klopp. History was made as a result. Slot made the best start by any Liverpool manager with 11 wins in his first 12 games, became the first Dutch coach to win the Premier League and joined the Anfield greats Joe Fagan and Sir Kenny Dalglish in winning the title in his first season. After the tragic events of the summer, the 46-year-old said: “To represent this club in this city now even means more to me and to my wife than it did before.”</p> <h2>Off-field picture</h2> <p>It has been a devastating summer for Liverpool after the deaths of Jota and his brother André Silva in a car accident on 3 July. The Portugal international was one of the most down-to-earth and popular figures in the dressing room, as well as a brilliant finisher who won the Premier League and Nations League in the weeks before his death. The grass verge behind the Main Stand at Anfield became a sea of tributes to the 28-year-old, who married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso, the mother of their three young children, 11 days before the accident. Liverpool have permanently retired Jota’s No 20 shirt in his honour across all levels of the club and have plans for a permanent memorial.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/kibJm/2/" data-alt="Last season’s results"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/kibJm/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Star signing</h2> <p>A certain Newcastle striker could make a late play for this title but, in the meantime, it is Wirtz who embodies Liverpool’s ambition and willingness to pay a record fee for a transformative signing. The champions beat off competition from Bayern Munich and Manchester City for the 22-year-old attacking midfielder, who also had interest from Real Madrid. Slot believes Wirtz’s creativity will compensate for Trent Alexander-Arnold’s exit and enable Liverpool to turn dominance in possession into more emphatic victories. Wirtz has looked a class act in pre-season, the former Bayer Leverkusen player’s passing, touch, awareness and ability to find pockets of space in and around the penalty area impressing.</p>    <h2>Stepping up</h2> <p>With impeccable timing, the 16-year-old left-winger Rio Ngumoha shone in a pre-season friendly against Yokohama F. Marinos on the day Luis Díaz completed his £65.5m move to Bayern. A fine display capped by an excellent individual goal showed Slot there could be another option to replace the Colombian. Ngumoha repeated the trick in his next outing against Athletic Bilbao. Chelsea were furious when Ngumoha left for Liverpool last summer. The teenager, for his part, felt there was a more straightforward pathway to the first team at Anfield. He will sign his first professional contract when he turns 17 on 29 August.</p> <h2>A big season for</h2> <p>Alexander-Arnold’s departure creates an opening for Conor Bradley to establish himself as the first-choice right-back. However, any prospect of a straightforward promotion for a 22-year-old who has all the attributes for the job, and the experience of 57 appearances for Liverpool, was curtailed days after the Premier League trophy was lifted. The champions announced the £29.5m signing of Frimpong on the day they accepted a €10m package from Madrid for Alexander-Arnold’s early release. The competition for Bradley remains as fierce as ever, but an opportunity is there to be seized.</p>
