<p>Buying gifts for a one-year-old can be a lot of fun. At this age, they’re increasingly inquisitive about the world and changing all the time. From “real world play”, such as pretend food sets, to a shape-sorter that’s bound to delight little ones, there are so many lovely options to appeal to this age group.</p> <p>If you’re looking for a toy to help with education and development, look for one that encourages problem-solving, hand-eye coordination or understanding cause and effect, as these are skills they are developing. As one-year-olds are often starting to walk and talk, you may also look for wooden walkers and books to spark their imaginations and help them get to grips with language.</p> <p>Having had a baby last year, I’ve learned how much space a tiny human’s things can take up, so it’s often worth choosing gifts that are compact or easy to tidy away. </p> <h2>***</h2> <h2>How I selected</h2> <p>I’ve included toys that one-year-olds <em>and</em> their parents will appreciate, focusing on things that will help little ones develop key skills, as well as encourage interaction and social play. I’ve excluded anything too unpleasantly noisy – parents, you can thank me later. I’ve put the products on this list through their paces with my daughter, along with some of her friends. </p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best toys and gifts for one-year-olds </h2> <p>***</p> <h2>Walker this way</h2>    <p><strong>Multi-activity baby walker</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.scandiborn.co.uk/products/little-dutch-multi-activity-baby-walker-forest-friends" > £69.95 at Scandiborn </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.millieandralph.co.uk/products/little-dutch-multi-activity-baby-walker-forest-friends" > £69.95 at Millie and Ralph </a>  <p>My daughter’s eyes lit up when I presented her with this wooden walker. She’s obsessed with pulling herself up on our sofa, and enjoyed practising on this. As it’s on wheels and she’s not yet walking, I hold it still for her, though you can also use the brake setting to keep it steady. There are all sorts to play with on the front and sides, including a spinning mirror, lots of blocks, cogs and beads to move around, and a simple shape sorter. If you’re giving this as a gift, you may give the parents a heads-up that it needs assembling, though I found it straightforward.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> wood<br><strong>Suitable for: </strong>1+ years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Fun figures</h2>    <p><strong>Pop-up wooden toy</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.elc.co.uk//galt-pop-up-wooden-toy/p/330316" > £11 at Early Learning Centre </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Galt-Toys-Classic-Pop-Up-Multi-Coloured/dp/B001P3SJG8" > £9.35 at Amazon </a>  <p>I bought one of these for my niece years ago, and it has stood the test of time. The compact wooden shape has four little figures that jump out when you press down on them, while the wooden pegs are ideal for little hands to grab – good for hand-eye coordination and colour matching.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> wood<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1+ years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Cute fit</h2>    <p><strong>Soft denim dungarees</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://babymori.com/products/soft-blue-denim-dungarees" > £35 at Mori </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.next.co.uk/style/su916946/g18748" > £35 at Next </a>  <p>These incredibly sweet denim dungarees from Mori are stylish and functional. Made from a mix of 88.5% organic cotton, 10% polyester and 1.5% elastane, they’re soft and comfy with some room to stretch. With poppers on the legs in all sizes up to the age of two (trust me, the parents will be grateful for this), they’re also designed for easy nappy and outfit changes. Clothes for little ones are often gendered, but these are unisex, making them an ideal gift that can also be passed on when they grow out of them.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> organic cotton, polyester and elastane<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> from three months to four years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Classic tales</h2>    <p><strong>The Gingerbread Man book</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-gingerbread-man-9781529052282/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=giftsforoneyearolds" > £7.19 at the Guardian Bookshop </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gingerbread-Man-Picture-Books/dp/140953166X" > £5.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>Maybe it’s the singsong rhythm of the words, or the push-and-pull sliders on each page, but I always enjoy reading this book to my daughter. There are loads of others in the First Stories series too, including <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/little-red-riding-hood-9781509808977?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=giftsforoneyearolds">Little Red Riding Hood</a> and <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-three-little-pigs-9781509821037/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=giftsforoneyearolds">The Three Little Pigs</a>.</p> <p>Board books have lots of benefits for little ones, says Emily Goodacre, research associate at Play in Education, Development and Learning (Pedal) at the University of Cambridge. “They have longevity. It’s going to be something that babies can look at by themselves, as they can pick them up and turn the pages, but they can also look at it with a parent,” she says. “With fewer words, you can focus more on the pictures and ad lib, which can be good for the child’s language development.” Unlike paper books, which can get easily torn or damaged by toddlers, board books are more hard-wearing, too.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> board <br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1+ (or younger for reading aloud)</p> <p>***</p> <h2>All aboard</h2>    <p><strong>Wooden stacking train</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.elc.co.uk/early-learning-centre-wooden-stacking-train/p/568817" > £20 at Early Learning Centre </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.thetoyshop.com/early-learning-centre-wooden-stacking-train/p/568817" > £20 at the Entertainer </a>  <p>With bright colours, animal faces, and blocks that can be stacked on and off the moving train, there are lots of ways your little one can play with this. My daughter was excited about this toy before I’d even taken it out of the box, which is always a good sign. She loves playing with the blocks and watching me pull the train around for her.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> wood<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1+ years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Word play</h2>    <p><strong>Learning Friends 100 Words book</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/leapfrog-learning-friends-100-words-book/p3695695" > £13.99 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/LeapFrog-601503-Educational-Interactive-Multi-Colour/dp/B07CSXPJRN" > £13.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>This interactive electronic book is packed with 100 words to help children develop their language skills in an engaging way. Each page is focused on a different category, including pets, food and vehicles. There are three different settings to choose from – you press the pictures to hear the word, a sound relating to the word or a fun fact about the word. My daughter loves to press the yellow star button and listen to all the different sounds the book makes. If you’ve got a bilingual child, or you just want to start them learning languages early, there’s also the option to switch between English and French. It’s handy for taking on the go, too, and a great distraction on long journeys. </p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> plastic<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1+ years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Round and round</h2>    <p><strong>Bead maze</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.elc.co.uk/woodlets-bead-maze/p/563078" > £10 at Early Learning Centre </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/bead-maze-12-mths-/p/hbp23042255" > £15 at M&amp;S </a>  <p>In my experience, a bead maze is a hit with every baby at soft play, and my daughter was delighted when I produced one at home, where no one was about to grab it from her. Made from sustainably sourced wood, kids will love moving the different coloured shapes around as they develop their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and get to grips with colours and shapes. It’s relatively small, so won’t take up loads of room and could easily be taken on trips.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> wood<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1+ years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Wheely good</h2>    <p><strong>Push &amp; Go scooter</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://sorenshouse.co.uk/products/scoot-ride-highway-kick-1-push-go-scooter-ash-1" > £124.95 at Soren’s House </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.scandiborn.co.uk/products/scoot-and-ride-highwaykick-1-push-go-steel" > £124.99 at Scandiborn </a>  <p>This neat scooter is designed to adapt to a child’s needs as they grow. A two-in-one, it can be used as a seated ride-on toy or as a stand-up scooter. There’s also a parent push bar to save your back, which can be used whether it’s in the seated or standing position. The adjustable seat and handlebar, as well as removable footrests, mean you can change things around as your child gets bigger, so they’ll get plenty of use out of it.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> plastic and metal<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1-5 years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Reading material</h2>    <p><strong>Who’s Hiding In The Park? </strong><strong>book</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://guardianbookshop.com/whos-hiding-in-the-park-9781035004430/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=giftsforoneyearolds" > £7.19 at the Guardian Bookshop </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Whos-Hiding-Park-Campbell-Scheffler/dp/1035004437" > £7.35 at Amazon </a>  <p>With charming illustrations by Axel Scheffler (who also illustrated <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-gruffalo-9781509804757/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=giftsforoneyearolds">The Gruffalo</a>) and different coloured felt flaps – sturdier than paper ones that are often ripped out – both kids and grownups will enjoy reading this sweet book<strong>. </strong>It’s a huge hit with my daughter, and she often reaches for it when we’re choosing a story.</p> <p>There are others in the series, too, including <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/whos-hiding-on-the-farm-9781529084702/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=giftsforoneyearolds">Who’s Hiding On The Farm?</a> and <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/whos-hiding-on-safari-9781035004447/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=giftsforoneyearolds">Who’s Hiding On Safari?</a> As well as being sturdier, “felt is more tactile,” says Larissa Hazell, a nanny with 14 years’ experience and founder of <a href="https://www.thechildcareguide.co.uk/home">The Childcare Guide</a>. “They can manipulate it, squash it and push it between their fingers. With those sorts of books, they’re not just about looking at the pictures and reading a story – there’s a sensory element, too.”</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> board<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1-3 years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Frame game</h2>    <p><strong>Four-in-one </strong><strong>climbing frame</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://goodevas.uk/products/4in1-montessori-climbing-set-pikler-triangle-arch-slide-board-and-cushion-for-toddlers-1-3-years" > £109 at Goodevas </a>  <p>This Montessori wooden indoor climbing frame set includes a climbing arch, which can also be flipped upside down and used as a rocking seat, and a Pikler triangle (named after the Hungarian paediatrician Dr Emmi Pikler, who designed it to encourage physical development).</p> <p>There’s also a slide board that can be used either to connect the two climbing bits or as a slide, as well as a cushion that fits the climbing arch when used as a seat. As far as toys go, it takes up quite a bit of room, but if you or your recipient has the space, it’s the perfect option for little ones to clamber all over as they get increasingly mobile. My daughter has a great time pulling herself up on to the two climbing frame parts and crawling through the Pikler triangle. It comes as a flat pack and – while the assembly process isn’t too complicated – that does take a little time.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> wood<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1-3 years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Throw shapes</h2>    <p><strong>Shape-sorting box</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://thekidcollective.co.uk/products/mushie-shape-sorting-box" > £29.71 at the Kid Collective </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.scandiborn.co.uk/products/mushie-shape-sorting-box" > £29.75 at Scandiborn </a>  <p>My daughter loves to put all of the shapes from this toy in her mouth, which is a sure-fire sign of approval. It keeps her engaged for a good while, too. “A well-designed shape-sorter, where the child can get them back out again and re-sort them, will help them learn what fits together and what doesn’t,” says Pedal’s Goodacre.</p> <p>My baby isn’t yet at the stage where she can do shape-sorting herself, but it’s a great toy to play with together. “A shape-sorter is the sort of toy that a parent would be more likely to get involved with,” says Goodacre. “You can do problem-solving together, for example, saying: ‘Can you see where that goes? Shall we try it on this one? Oh, it doesn’t fit there, let’s try another one.’”</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> plastic<br><strong>Suitable for: </strong>10 months+</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Perfect plushies</h2>    <p><strong>Bashful bunny toy, small</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://jellycat.com/bashful-beige-bunny/" > £18 at Jellycat </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://babymori.com/products/jellycat-small-bashful-beige-bunny" > £18 at Mori </a>  <p>This classic Jellycat bunny is soft and comes in different sizes – the small one is great for babies to play with both at home and when out and about. My daughter was given one as a gift and has become attached to it, and her friends love playing with it too. As a bonus, it comes in useful for distractions during nappy changes when your child doesn’t want to cooperate. You can also get the bashful bunny in <a href="https://www.jojomamanbebe.co.uk/style/su301540/b95750">rattle</a> and <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/jellycat-bashful-bunny-comforter-soft-toy/p111839317">comforter</a> form, and there’s the option to have gifts personalised. </p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> polyester<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> from birth</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Make a splash</h2>    <p><strong>Upcycled boat bath toy</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.babipur.co.uk/products/oli-carol-boat-bath-toy" > £24.95 at Babipur </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.littleconcepts.co.uk/products/upcycled-boat-bath-toy-orange" > £24.98 at Little Concepts </a>  <p>“Bathtime with toys is brilliant,” says The Childcare Guide’s Hazell. “It’s a time when parents aren’t distracted, so the child has their undivided attention. Most children love being in the water and playing, so it’s also a lovely bonding time.” Featuring three different parts which stack to make a boat, this toy from Oli &amp; Carol is perfect for making bath-time fun. My daughter was excited when I presented this – she loves the bright colours, getting the boat to float and watching me pour water out of the different shapes. Made from natural rubber from hevea trees and upcycled cherry seeds, it has great eco-credentials, too.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> natural rubber<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> from birth</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Easy as ABC</h2>    <p><strong>Wooden alphabet abacus</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-wooden-alphabet-abacus/p4263194" > £16 at John Lewis </a>  <p>Small enough for little ones to pick up and hold, this wooden abacus will keep kids entertained in different ways as they grow and develop. Each block has a letter on one side and a picture of something beginning with that letter on the other, as well as numbers one to 10 at the bottom. Right now, my daughter loves spinning the blocks, and I’ve been talking her through what’s on them; it’ll be a great educational tool for helping her to learn the alphabet and new words as she gets older. It’s also compact and easy to tidy away.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> wood<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> from 18 months</p> <p>***</p> <h2>All-weather adventures</h2>    <p><strong>Waterproof scampsuit</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://muddypuddles.com/products/waterproof-scampsuit-green" > £95 at Muddy Puddles </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/muddy-puddles-baby-hooded-scampsuit-green-bolt/p113834985" > £95 at John Lewis </a>  <p>While a puddle suit might not be quite as exciting as a shiny new toy for a one-year-old to unwrap, they’ll be thrilled when they can roam about outside in all weathers. Hazell advises looking for one that is fully waterproof rather than showerproof: “Showerproof ones are cheaper but they’re not actually waterproof, so as soon as a child sits down in the puddle, which they love to do, they’re wet through,” she says.</p> <p>This three-in-one waterproof scampsuit from Muddy Puddles fits the bill, with a 10,000mm waterproof rating that promises to keep kids dry in heavy rain. It’s versatile, too, with two layers including a waterproof suit and an inner fleece onesie. Each layer can be worn on its own or together, and the adjustable stirrups will keep the suit in place.</p> <p>While they aren’t the cheapest, the Muddy Puddles suits have been recommended to me by various mum friends, who say they hold up well. There’s also a <a href="https://preloved.muddypuddles.com/">preloved</a> section on the Muddy Puddles website where you can pick up secondhand items at discounted prices.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> recycled polyester<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> newborns to six-year-olds</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Hits the spot</h2>    <p><strong>Bear hammer game</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.jojomamanbebe.co.uk/style/su618374/f15140" > £18 at Jojo Maman Bébé </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.next.co.uk/style/su618374/f15140" > £18 at Next </a>  <p>Kids are generally big fans of bashing things, which is what this hammer bench toy is all about. Made from wood, the bench has a cute bear at each end, six wooden cylinders in pastel hues and a mini hammer that’s easy for little hands to get hold of. “They’re really great for hand-eye coordination, as well as learning about cause and effect, and different levels of sound,” says Hazell. My daughter and her friend had great fun playing with this, bashing and pushing the wooden cylinders through the holes.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> wood <br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1+ years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Screen-free stories</h2>    <p><strong>Toniebox 2</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://tonies.com/en-gb/toniebox-2/toniebox-2-box-only-sky-blue/" > £94.99 at Tonies </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/tonies-toniebox-2-starter-set/sky-blue/p113997448" > £99.99 at John Lewis </a>  <p>The Tonies Toniebox 2 is an audio player that aims to engage kids with stories, songs and games without the need for screens. This is its second version, launched this year and suitable for one-year-olds and upwards (unlike the first-generation Toniebox, which is for ages 3+).</p> <p>You or your child place Tonies (little characters you buy separately) on top of the box to play different stories. Ideal for one-year-olds are the new My First Tonies sets (<a href="https://tonies.com/en-gb/my-first-tonies/">£29.99 at Tonies</a>), which include three squishy figures (choose from Farm, Jungle or Travel) that play sounds and songs designed for toddlers. We have the farm set, and my daughter gets engrossed in the animal sounds and songs it plays.</p> <p>Other new features of the Toniebox 2 include interactive games and quizzes through Tonieplay, as well as a sleep timer with a light and a sunrise alarm, which is handy if you want to use the stories for bedtime. </p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> plastic<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1-9+ years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Hit the right note</h2>    <p><strong>Caterpillar musical stand</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://babymori.com/products/janod-caterpillar-musical-stand" > £26.99 at Mori </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Janod-Caterpillar-Childrens-Activities-Awakening/dp/B0CTKL8DRP" > £29.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>This toy from the French brand Janod will help children explore their musical side. With maracas, a xylophone, a scratcher and two removable rattles (one has bells and the other is a rain stick), there are five different instruments contained in an aesthetically pleasing caterpillar-themed design. </p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> wood and metal<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 18 months+</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Farm fun</h2>    <p><strong>Large peg puzzle</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/melissa-doug-farm-friends-large-peg-puzzle/p110186552" > £11.99 at John Lewis </a>  <p>Made from thick wood, this farm-themed toy is ideal for introducing little ones to puzzles. It comes with eight different pieces, which each have a corresponding picture behind them on the board, so kids can match them up. It’s sturdy enough to stand up to being manhandled by toddlers, and the big wooden handles on each puzzle piece are easy for small hands to grasp. </p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> wood, metal and paper<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1+ years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Tall tales</h2>    <p><strong>Giraffes Can’t Dance board book</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://guardianbookshop.com/giraffes-cant-dance-cased-board-book-9781408354407/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=giftsforoneyearolds" > £7.19 at the Guardian Bookshop </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Giraffes-Cant-Dance-International-Bestseller/dp/1841215651/" > £7.35 at Amazon </a>  <p>This book tells the story of Gerald the giraffe, who – as the title suggests – is not a natural dancer, unlike his other animal pals in the jungle. It’s a sweet story that’s accompanied by lovely illustrations. It’s available as a paperback, but the board book is ideal for toddlers as it’s much more durable. Our copy is a hand-me-down from my nieces that’s been loved for years and is now a firm favourite in my daughter’s collection of books.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> board<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> from birth</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Green shoots</h2>    <p><strong>Gardening role-play kit</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.naturalbabyshower.co.uk/products/tiny-love-garden-kit-garden-of-adventures" > £25.19 at Natural Baby Shower </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/tiny-love-garden-of-adventure-my-first-garden-role-play-kit/p111896912" > £27.99 at John Lewis </a>  <p>Teach little ones about growing things and encourage their imaginations with this cute gardening-themed toy. Made from natural cotton, wood and recycled polyester, it comes with a set of three soft toys in the shape of different vegetables, as well as a wooden watering can and a wooden container with soft padding for them to practise planting them in. It’s a great one for role-play games, and toddlers will love putting the squishy vegetables in the pot, and taking them out again.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> cotton, plywood, solid wood, polyester<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1+ years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Farmyard adventures</h2>    <p><strong>Animal farm playset</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/fisher-price-little-people-caring-fun-animal-farm-playset/p113903883" > £32 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fisher-Price-Little-People-Caring-Animals/dp/B083VZ88JC" > £34.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>With a two-storey barn, a selection of farm animals and a farmer and all kinds of interactive features, this Fisher-Price set aims to keep children entertained and engaged for a good while. It’s perfect for imaginative play, as kids can move the animals around the barn and whiz the hay bale down the drop-through silo. Toddlers will also enjoy pressing the big orange button, which plays more than 50 songs, sounds and phrases to encourage learning about things like opposites, colours and counting. For those with bilingual children, you can set the language to English, French, German, Italian or Dutch.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> plastic<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1+ years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Colourful creations</h2>    <p><strong>Stacking rainbow</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.babipur.co.uk/products/grimms-wooden-rainbow-toy-medium" > £26.95 at Babipur </a>  <p>The Grimm’s wooden stacking rainbows are beautifully made toys that are ideal for all sorts of open-ended play. My nieces have a set, and they’ve had hours of fun with it over the years, and they now enjoy playing with it with my daughter. While the bigger sets are more expensive (about £70), this medium set is suitable from 12 months and comes in at less than £30. It has six parts that are made from the same piece of lime wood and stained using non-toxic, water-based colour, each in a different shade of the rainbow. Kids can use the different parts to build their own creations or use them with other toys as bridges, tunnels and more.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> wood<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 1+ years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Mess to impress</h2>    <p><strong>Play-dough starter set</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.vertbaudet.co.uk/dough-starter-kit-by-djeco-blue.htm?ProductId=620032182&amp;FiltreCouleur=6409" > £21 at Vertbaudet </a>  <p>Designed to introduce kids to the joys of play-dough, this set comes with four different coloured tubs of soft dough, which are ideal for tiny hands to get to grips with. Suitable for 18 months onwards, it comes with various tools to encourage creativity, including a rolling pin, and pizza wheel cutter, as well as stamps and animal-shaped cutters. There’s also a dough press, which little ones can use with the stamp templates and push down on to create all kinds of fun shapes. The dough is designed to be non-staining, which parents will appreciate, too.</p> <p><strong>Materials:</strong> modelling dough and plastic<br><strong>Suitable for:</strong> 18 months+</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Timeless toy</h2>    <p><strong>Paddington Bear</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/paddington-bear-plush-soft-toy-medium/p3949411" > £19.99 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.hamleys.com/cuddly-classic-paddington-bear" > £24.99 at Hamleys </a>  <p>As toddlers get increasingly interested in cuddly toys, this sweet (medium-size) Paddington Bear toy makes for a lovely gift.

Firstly, looking for toys that are open-ended, can be used in multiple ways and for a long time,” says Hazell, from The Childcare Guide. “Secondly, a toy that will encourage conversation between parents and their child, and spark their imagination.”</p> <p>When choosing a gift for one-year-olds, Hazell suggests looking for “toys that are repetitive with a clear consequence”, colour- and shape-matching toys, as well as things that “encourage creativity, imagination, story telling or building”. Anything that inspires “real-world play”, such as people, animals and vehicles is also a good idea.</p> <h2>How often should I rotate toys for a one-year-old?</h2> <p>Don’t feel you have to rotate toys on a set schedule, says Pedal’s Goodacre. “It depends on the child and how intensively and how long they’re showing interest in something,” she says. “If they’ve really latched on to a toy, I’d let them play with it for as long as they’re getting something out of it. At this age, if they’re showing active interest in something, then they’re learning from it. Letting them see that through will be beneficial.”</p> <p>On the flip side, if you put a toy out and your child shows no interest, it may be worth putting it away for a few weeks and then trying again.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Isabelle Aron is a lifestyle and culture journalist.
