Here’s a medieval predecessor of The Exorcist for Halloween. This 15th-century painting shows how deeply rooted the belief in possession by demons is in the European past. The victim here looks ill and distraught, her face agonised and eyes vacant, as the little devil that lived in her is cast out. In other words it’s a realistic painting of some kind of psychological or neurological crisis. In the world of medieval Christendom that might well be diagnosed as possession by a demon. Lippi and his team portray the demon as a dark creature with wings and claws, uncannily jumping out of the victim’s mouth. People would carry on being plagued by such visions into the late 1600s. Today we enjoy them as entertainment. Father, could you help an old altar boy?<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/fra-filippo-lippi-and-workshop-saint-zeno-exorcising-the-daughter-of-gallienus">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in </strong><strong>touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
