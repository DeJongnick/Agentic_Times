<ul> <li><p><strong>Work is under way on the military component of security guarantees for Ukraine</strong> that European leaders and Donald Trump have committed to if there is a peace deal. A small group of military leaders held discussions in Washington to work out options, a western official told Reuters on Wednesday, shortly after a bigger virtual meeting wrapped up. <strong>Gen Dan Caine, chair</strong><strong> of the US joint chiefs of staff</strong>, held the talks, which also involved around half a dozen other <strong>Nato defence chiefs</strong>. The chair of the Nato military committee, Adm Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, called it a “great, candid discussion … Priority continues to be a just, credible and durable peace”.</p></li> <li><p>As the <strong>“coalition of the willing” began to take on a preliminary shape</strong>, Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Ukraine was also working on a plan with its allies on how to proceed “<strong>in case the Russian side continues to prolong the war and disrupt agreements on bilateral and trilateral formats of leaders’ meetings”</strong>. Yermak said: “Our teams, above all the military, have already begun active work on the military component of security guarantees.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia, meanwhile, continued to display its apparent intention to delay a possible meeting between Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy</strong>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/20/russia-international-talks-ukraine-security-putin-europe">writes Pjotr Sauer</a>. Sergei Lavrov, Putin’s foreign minister, complained on Wednesday that Moscow should be included in any talks on Ukraine’s security guarantees: “To discuss security guarantees seriously without Russia is a road to nowhere.” Russia gave Ukraine a supposed “security guarantee” under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/05/we-knew-putin-would-attack-ukraine-back-in-2011-says-bill-clinton">Budapest memorandum of 1994</a>, which <strong>Putin has long since comprehensively violated</strong> by attacking Ukraine.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lavrov avoided any direct reference to a possible Putin-Zelenskyy summit</strong> and said China, Russia’s ally in the war, should be among Ukraine’s security guarantors. Kyiv is likely to view that with deep scepticism, given that <strong>Russia uses equipment and materials from China to attack </strong>Ukraine, and that the two countries have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/09/china-russia-ties-criticise-us-victory-day">vowed to pursue a “no-limits” partnership</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Analysts suggested Putin would probably only meet Zelenskyy to accept a complete Ukrainian capitulation</strong>. Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said: “He has repeatedly stated that such a meeting would only be possible if there were well-prepared grounds, which in practice means Zelenskyy’s acceptance of Russia’s terms for ending the war.”</p></li> <li><p>Drones attacked Kyiv over Wednesday night into Thursday morning as the <strong>Ukrainian air force issued a national alert for missile attacks after Russian warplanes took off</strong>. Earlier on Wednesday, at least three people were killed in a <strong>Russian artillery attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kostiantynivka</strong>, local officials said. Another four were wounded. The governor, Vadym Filashkin, said it involved eight strikes from a multiple rocket launch system and targeted a local market. At least 14 people, including a family with three children, were wounded in a <strong>Russian attack on Ukraine’s northern region of Sumy</strong>.</p></li> <li><p>A “massive drone strike” on the southern Ukrainian region of Odesa injured one person and caused a <strong>large fire at a fuel and energy facility</strong>, Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Wednesday. Ukrainian drone forces, meanwhile, scored a major hit on the&nbsp;<strong>Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Russia’s Rostov region,</strong>&nbsp;where fires and explosions were captured on video.</p></li> <li><p>A <strong>Russian military drone exploded in Polish farmland</strong>, also on Wednesday, blowing the windows out of houses and igniting a furious response from authorities. “Once again, we are facing a provocation from the Russian Federation, with a Russian drone,” said Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, the Polish defence minister. The explosion was in a cornfield near the village of Osiny, about 100km (60 miles) from Warsaw and near the borders with Ukraine and Russian-allied Belarus. Poland’s foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, condemned <strong>“a new violation of our airspace from the east</strong> … The foreign ministry will protest to the perpetrator of this violation.”</p></li> <li><p>It was believed to be a <strong>Russian drone type called Gerbera,</strong> which is often used as a decoy in attacks against Ukraine. Poland’s Gen Dariusz Malinowski said the aircraft “was a decoy drone, which was not armed but <strong>carried a self-destruct warhead</strong>”. Russian drones and missiles have crossed into the airspace of Nato members Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania several times in the three and a half years since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. The latest incident comes less than a month after a Russian military drone flew into Lithuania from Belarus.</p></li> </ul>
