<h1>As a long-term psychiatric patient, I’ve had superior care from the NHS</h1>

<p>I read with interest the letters about psychiatric care in the NHS (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/11/fundamental-flaws-in-the-nhs-psychiatric-system">11 July</a>), prompted by Rachel Clarke’s review of Bella Jackson’s book Fragile Minds (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/30/fragile-minds-by-bella-jackson-review-a-furious-assault-on-nhs-psychiatry">A furious assault on NHS psychiatry, 30 June</a>). I have not read the book but, as a long-term psychiatric patient, I would like to make two points.</p> <p>First, care naturally varies in quality, suitability and success. Following three years in unsatisfactory private care (after many previous years in NHS care), I have happily returned to the NHS. I find its care superior, but hamstrung by limited resources, which can mean waiting many months for an appointment. But I have never been treated badly, as Jackson suggests is common, even when in the worst state.</p> <p>Second, I was struck by what Jackson says a junior doctor said to her (as quoted by Clarke): “‘Let’s quetiapine them today!’ And I asked him why quetiapine, and he said, ‘They put you in the best hotels for conferences.’” As Clarke says, this is ludicrous, and certainly the only time I have heard “quetiapine” used as a verb, which strikes me as improbable.<br><br>Quetiapine has been a generic drug since 2012 (ie open to any company to manufacture and market, just as, say, paracetamol is). I cannot believe that a junior doctor would prescribe it in the hope of being put up in a “best hotel” for a conference.</p> <p>It has long been the first-line treatment for psychosis, and for good reason: it works. I have been on quetiapine for 15 years. It’s not an enviable position to be in, but I am glad it exists, and grateful to those who have – quite rightly – prescribed it to me.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• I was disappointed to read that Cathy Wield was “subjected to increasingly damaging interventions, including electroconvulsive therapy” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/11/fundamental-flaws-in-the-nhs-psychiatric-system">Letters, 11 July</a>). I was treated with ECT for severe depression (with my full consent) in 2006 and it saved my life. In subsequent years when I had relapses, it again was highly effective as a treatment and I recovered fully, and have been well for the last five years. I would hope that patients won’t dismiss ECT as a potential treatment for depression based on its negative portrayal in the press, but be guided by NHS professionals who prescribe what they believe is best for the individual patient.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p>
