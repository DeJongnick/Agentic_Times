<p>A passenger flight preparing to take off near <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc">Washington DC</a> and an incoming US military jet received instructions to divert and prevent a possible collision on Friday, officials said.</p> <p>The close call at Ronald Reagan Washington National airport came about two months after a passenger jet and US army helicopter collided near the airport, killing all 67 people onboard both aircraft. The earlier crash, on 29 January, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/dc-plane-crash-ntsb-report">prompted</a> federal investigators to recommend a ban on some helicopter flights in that area.</p> <p>On Friday, Delta Air Lines Flight 2983 was cleared for takeoff at the Reagan airport at about 3.15pm, at the same time four US air force T-38 Talon aircraft were inbound, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement.</p> <p>The jets were heading for a flyover of Arlington National Cemetery when the Delta aircraft received an onboard alert of a nearby aircraft. Air traffic controllers “issued corrective instructions to both aircraft”, according to the FAA, which intends to investigate.</p> <p>The Airbus A319 with 131 passengers, two pilots and three flight attendants was embarking on a regularly scheduled flight between Reagan and Minneapolis-St Paul international airport, Delta said.</p> <p>The flight left its gate at 2.55pm and was scheduled to arrive at Minneapolis-St Paul at 4.36pm local time before the flight crew followed the diversion instructions from the controllers, the airline said.</p> <p>Air traffic control audio on the website LiveATC.net captured the pilot on Friday’s flight saying at one point: “On that departure … was there an actual aircraft about 500 feet below us as we came off?”</p> <p>As CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/us/delta-military-jet-close-call-dca/index.html">reported</a>, the departure controller replied to the pilot: “Delta 2983, affirmative.”</p> <p>No injuries were reported.</p> <p>The air force’s website describes the T-38 Talon as “a twin-engine, high-altitude, supersonic jet trainer” used by different departments and agencies, including Nasa, for various roles including pilot training.</p> <p>Later, on Saturday, a United Airlines flight from Houston landing at Reagan airport appeared to have struck a kite while landing. The plane landed safely and was not damaged, the airline said in a statement to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-flight-hits-kite-reagan-national-airport/">CBS</a>.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>
