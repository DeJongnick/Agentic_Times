<p>Good morning. In Reni Eddo-Lodge’s seminal book <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race">Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race</a>, she laments that while most Britons can recall the Montgomery bus boycott from the US civil rights movement, few know of the Bristol bus boycott that took place at a similar time. Many remain unaware that Britain had its own civil rights movement.</p> <p>In 2020, Eddo-Lodge became the first Black British author to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/21/reni-eddo-lodge-uk-book-charts-debate-racism-game-some-dont-want-to-play">top the UK book charts</a>, as readers reached for her work during the global uprising sparked by the killing of George Floyd. Protesters chanted that Black history is British history, demanding a reckoning with the country’s own struggles over race and injustice.</p> <p>Months earlier, British rapper Dave had performed Black at the Brit Awards, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/new-generation-behind-britain-anti-racism-protests-young-black-activists-equality">formative cultural moment for Black gen Z</a>, which was followed by Steve McQueen’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/15/small-axe-review-steve-mcqueen-triumphs-with-tales-of-britains-caribbean-history">Small Axe</a> anthology on the BBC. Black Britain was at long last being allowed to assert its own identity.</p> <p>Five years on, that desire for particularity has deepened even further. But what does this shift reveal about the evolution of Britain’s Black community, and why have Afro-American stories always dominated so much of Black History Month? To explore that, I spoke to <em><strong>Lanre Bakare</strong></em>, the Guardian’s culture correspondent and author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/we-were-there-9781847927477/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">We Were There</a>.

It was inspired by the American version, which began in the 1920s (though theirs is marked in February) and for many years Britain imported not only the concept but much of the content too.</p> <p>“There’s been this emphasis on Black cultural figures and Black stories in the UK – so like the Bristol bus boycott, for example, is something that more people are talking about. That’s our civil-rights story,” Lanre told me.</p> <p>It is notable that the Tate Modern is hosting the UK’s first major exhibition on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/13/nigerian-modernism-tate-modern-exhibition-london-ben-okri">modern art in Nigeria</a> and its impact in the UK, while the <a href="https://www.kayd.org/somali-week-festival-2025-1">Somali Week festival</a>, founded by the cultural trailblazer Ayan Mahamoud MBE, is now in its 17th year and expects a record 4,000 attenders, reflecting the growing confidence and reach of the British-Somali community. These events don’t just celebrate Black British culture, they delve deeper into the distinct heritages that make it up.</p> <p>“As a British-Nigerian, it’s so incredible to see a cultural juggernaut like the Tate Modern hosting an exhibition on Nigerian Modernism. It comes off the back of the hugely successful <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/16/soul-of-a-nation-art-in-the-age-of-black-power-tate-modern-review">2017 show Soul of the Nation</a>, which looked at a range of black artists during the US civil rights movement. Shows like that were a launchpad for what we are seeing today,” Lanre said. “Now the next evolution is: let’s get more specific.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Fear of erasure</strong></p> <p>When I asked Lanre where this demand for specificity came from, he pointed to two competing feelings within the Black British community: a growing fear of erasure and a rising sense of confidence.</p> <p>Let’s start with the first. Among some communities, there is anxiety about a slow fading of identity as Britain’s Black population expands and becomes more settled. Lanre noted that for much of the 20th century, the Black community in the UK was predominantly Caribbean, but this began to shift in the 1990s with the influx of Somali, Nigerian and other African migrants.</p> <p>Lanre pointed to Carnival as one example, where recent years have seen debates about the importance of keeping Caribbean culture at its core rather than rebranding it simply as “Black British” and losing sight of its West Indian roots.</p> <p>“We have also seen a massive loss of black cultural and community centres in recent decades in areas predominantly West Indian or Caribbean,” Lanre says, “And that’s something people really feel, because they were kind of centres for their Black culture; a place where you could play dominoes or hang out and talk and read the news, to pray and discuss issues that were going on or organise and protest. Those are slowly slipping away.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Growing confidence</strong></p> <p>The other piece of the puzzle is the growing confidence within different Black British communities</p> <p>“There has been a general shift within Black British culture over the past 15 years, there was this influx of people in the 90s, a lot of Nigerians, a lot of Somalis, who have then established bigger communities. Obviously, there were always Nigerians and Somalis in Britain, but their culture has come through,” Lanre says.</p> <p>He sees this as a positive development. At the opening of the Nigerian Modernism exhibition at Tate Modern, he noted the overwhelming number of Black British people from different backgrounds who came to show support.</p>    <p>While I too welcome this new focus on heritage and detail, I wonder whether something might be lost if Black Britons retreat into silos. For some, this moment echoes the fading unity of the Pan-African era.</p> <p>It isn’t a sentiment with which Lanre agrees. “The Pan-African ideas that arrived in the mid-20th century brought people together under this banner: let’s push back against colonialism and imperialism. These are big, important ideas; we shouldn’t dismiss them, but I see the current climate as positive, natural evolution, from that,” he explains.</p> <p>“I think Black British people understand we’re made up of distinct elements, and a lot of people feel comfortable moving between them.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Do we need Black History Month</strong></p> <p>Before we finished our conversation, I asked Lanre if I could play devil’s advocate for a moment. With the explosion of Black British culture and events taking place year-round, what would he say to those who question whether we still need a Black History Month?</p> <p>His answer was unequivocal: yes. “There’s huge ignorance out there,” he said, pointing to a survey last year that found that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/26/half-of-britons-cant-name-a-black-british-historical-figure-survey-finds">more than half of Britons</a> know so little about Black British history that they cannot name a single historical figure.</p> <p>“When I was touring my book [you can check out <a href="https://www.lanrebakare.com/events">future events here]</a>, so many people came up after and said, ‘I just didn’t know any of this.’ People do not have a clue because they’re not exposed to it,” Lanre says. Black History Month is an opportunity to change that.</p> <p>Still, he added, “there’s a cynical side, where big institutions funnel all their Black-history efforts into October, then nothing for the rest of the year. That’s not great.” Even so, while acknowledging the argument that Black history is every month, Lanre insists that October remains an important organising tool. </p> <p>When I was in primary school, the stories told during BHM didn’t connect to my reality as a black girl in east London. But that’s different for black children today who are growing up in an unprecedented era of cultural visibility and pride. There may still be much more to do, more to learn and enjoy about Black British culture and history, but it is worth pausing to celebrate just how far we have come.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>For a whole generation, <strong>Philip Pullman’s Northern Lights</strong> trilogy is a seminal text – now he is completing his sequel Book of Dust trilogy, completing the story of heroine Lyra Belacqua, making this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/16/lyras-last-story-exclusive-extract-from-philip-pullmans-final-installment-in-the-book-of-dust-trilogy">exclusive extract</a> a must read (or listen). <em><strong>Toby Moses, head of newsletters</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Mazyouna is one of tens of thousands of children in Gaza who sustained life-altering injuries from Israeli airstrikes.

The <strong>Mirror</strong> has “MI5 chief’s Beijing warning … China is threat every day”. Similar in the <strong>i paper:</strong> “MI5 chief warns UK of need to confront ‘daily’ China spy threat”, and the <strong>Telegraph</strong> says “MI5 chief dismayed by China spy fiasco”. The <strong>Mail’s</strong> line is “Andrew and ‘spy chief’ at heart of China scandal”. The <strong>Metro</strong> has “Whose side are you on, Sir Keir?” under the strapline “Storm grows over ‘spy’ trial fiasco”. Lastly, football mixed with geopolitics in the <strong>Express</strong>: “Ban on Israeli fans is ‘a national disgrace’”.</p> <h2>Something for the weekend</h2> <p><em>Our critics’ roundup of the best things to watch, read, play and listen to right now</em></p>    <p><strong>TV</strong><br><strong>Riot Women</strong> <strong>| ★★★★☆<br></strong>Sally Wainwright should be prescribed on the NHS as a form of HRT. Riot Women is about a quintet of menopausees facing the question of when all this shite is going to stop and how they are going to manage until it does. First, we meet Beth (Joanna Scanlan), who has decided that the only answer to this question is to take her own life. She only stops trying to see her plan through when her friend Jess (Lorraine Ashbourne) rings. “D’you want to be in a rock band?” It is, of course, in Wainwright’s customary manner, perfectly seasoned with humour, from the lightest to the darkest. Like Wainwright’s Happy Valley, it looks at the multitudinous roles women manage, the caring responsibilities that accumulate and how they evolve over a lifetime. <em><strong>Lucy Mangan</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Music<br>Tame Impala: Deadbeat | ★★★★☆<br></strong>You could read the first Tame Impala album in five years as a treatise on trying to balance success with some kind of normality, the disjunction between the demands of fame and domesticity. On Dracula, Kevin Parker is riddled with self-loathing for enjoying himself like “fucking Pablo Escobar” when he should be at home. On Piece of Heaven, he seems to be in his children’s bedroom, haunted by his absence from their lives. There’s always been a melancholy undertow to his Tame Impala work, but here he sounds more disconsolate than ever. If it’s occasionally confused, it’s also painfully honest and genuinely wracked: you leave it hoping the man who made it is OK. <em><strong>Alexis Petridis</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Film<br>Ballad of a Small Player | ★★★☆☆<br></strong>The vast emptiness of luxury hotels is part of the mystery and spectacle of Edward Berger’s intriguing if static and overwrought psychological drama-thriller; it is about a desperate chancer and gambling addict, faced with the metaphysical crisis of renewing or annulling his existence by staking everything on a single bet. Colin Farrell plays a professional gambler who styles himself “Lord Doyle”, adrift in the Chinese gambling mecca of Macau, the Asian Vegas; Tilda Swinton has a frankly preposterous part as Betty, a cartoony woman who is pursuing Doyle and knows his terrible secret back in the UK. It’s a movie of big moods and grand gestures, undercut by the banal inevitability of losing. <em><strong>Peter Bradshaw</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Games<br>Battlefield 6 (PC, PS5, Xbox ) | ★★★★☆<br></strong>Barely a minute into your first round of the large-scale multiplayer mode, Conquest, you will know you are back in Battlefield at its absolute best. Fighter jets scorch over head, tanks rumble by, the side of a building is obliterated by a rocket-propelled grenade. When you’re caught in a battle in this game, it is exhilarating. The visuals and sound design are astonishingly good. The weak point is the game’s superfluous Campaign mode but, for the most part, Battlefield 6 is a brilliant return to form, a thrilling, almost operatic shooter experience, which manages to combine deafening combat with tactical subtlety. <em><strong>Keith Stuart</strong></em></p> <h2>Today in Focus</h2>    <p><strong>‘The sacrifice’: was Kai Shannon wrongfully convicted of murder?
