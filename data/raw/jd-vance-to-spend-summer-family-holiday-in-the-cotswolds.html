<p>He made his name with a memoir set among the hillbillies of the rugged Appalachians – yet it seems JD Vance now favours altogether more gentle hills.</p> <p>For his family’s holiday this year the US vice-president is understood to have chosen the Cotswolds, where Land Rovers outnumber pickup trucks.</p> <p>Vance, his wife, Usha, and their three young children are expected next month to rent a property in the region – an increasingly popular choice for wealthy tourists – soon after Donald Trump, the US president, finishes a stay in Scotland.</p> <p>Earlier in August, Vance and his family are expected to visit London, despite the vice-president having previously expressed reservations about the city, which he said – shortly before last year’s presidential election – was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPlqID3zv4k">not English any more</a>.”</p> <p>In February, Vance lashed out at European governments – including that of the UK – accusing political leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration and running in fear from voters.</p> <p>“In Britain and across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat,” he told the Munich Security Conference, listing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/14/thought-and-cancelled-elections-how-do-jd-vances-europe-claims-stand-up">a string of cases </a>he claimed were evidence. Britain was singled out for arresting a man praying near an abortion clinic.</p> <p>But while Vance might enjoy the Cotswolds – home to the Chipping Norton set whose ranks include David Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson – a different reception could await when he later travels on to Scotland, which is home to anti-Trump sentiment.</p> <p>In his Munich speech, Vance hit out at the Scottish government over abortion rights, saying it was distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay “within so-called safe access zones”, warning them that “even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/21/cotswolds-jd-vance-family-holiday">What did the people of the Cotswolds do to deserve a visit from JD Vance? | Zoe Williams </a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added: “The government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime in Britain and across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Scottish government said Vance’s claim was inaccurate. It appeared to be a reference to the introduction of safe access zones within 200 metres of abortion clinics, banning any form of harassment.</p> <p>“Private prayer at home is not prohibited within safe access zones and no letter has ever suggested it was,” added the spokesperson.</p> <p>Vance’s trip to the UK comes at a time when tourist traffic going in the opposite direction has plummeted against the backdrop of<strong> </strong>Trump’s policies and rhetoric.</p> <p>The number of UK residents visiting the US was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/apr/12/im-super-worried-fewer-uk-tourists-visiting-us-amid-trumps-policies-and-rhetoric">down 14.3% in March </a>compared with the same month in 2024, official figures showed. However, Britons continue to make up the largest number of overseas visitors to the US.</p>
