<p>Fort Bliss is preparing to accept 1,000 immigrant detainees as the Trump administration moves to use military bases for its unprecedented mass deportation operation and immigration crackdown.</p> <p>The facility, named Camp East Montana, is set to begin operations on 17 August at the US army post near El Paso, Texas. Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) said in a statement that<strong> </strong>the facility will initially house up to 1,000 detainees, with plans to expand to a capacity of 5,000 beds.</p> <p>If the center reaches full capacity, the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ice-detention-facility-fort-bliss-013218532.html">El Paso Times</a> reports that it would become the largest immigration detention facility in the US.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/07/former-superman-actor-dean-cain-reveals-hes-becoming-an-ice-agent-to-support-trumps-mass-deportation-agenda">Former Superman actor Dean Cain reveals he’s becoming an Ice agent to support Trump’s mass deportation agenda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An Ice spokesperson said the agency is using<strong> </strong>the facility to help “decompress Ice detention facilities in other regions” and will serve as a short-term processing center. The statement adds that deportations carried out via “Ice air operations” will also take place at the facility.</p> <p>According to Ice, the facility will house undocumented immigrants who “are in removal proceedings or who have final orders of removal”.</p> <p>The site is being constructed under a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/25_0423_cpo_ICE-Contract-70CDCR25D00000014-Temporary-Housing-for-Detainees.pdf">Department of Defense contract</a>, Ice said, and is funded “as part of the essential whole-of-government approach to protecting public safety and preserving national security”.</p> <p>In July, administration officials announced that <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract/Article/4250988/">Acquisition Logistics LLC</a>, a Virginia-based contractor, was awarded a $231.8m firm-fixed-price contract to “establish and operate” the “5,000 capacity, single adult, short-term detention facility”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-22/trump-awards-immigration-detention-center-contract-for-fort-bliss-in-texas">Bloomberg</a> reported that Acquisition Logistics has no prior experience operating detention facilities.</p>    <p>In the statement from Ice, the agency said that Ice personnel “will be responsible for the management and operational authority” at the facility, and that the establishment of the center is being “carried out with contracted support and according to Ice detention standards”.</p> <p>The agency described the facility as “soft-sided” and said that it will offer “everything a traditional Ice detention facility offers”, which Ice said includes access to legal representation, a law library and space for visitation, recreation and medical treatment, as well as “necessary accommodations for disabilities, diet and religious belief”.</p> <p>In a statement to<strong> </strong>the Guardian, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin also<strong> </strong>confirmed the use of Fort Bliss to house immigration detainees.</p> <p>“Ice is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity” McLaughlin said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”</p> <p>In March, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention">the Guardian reported</a> that Fort Bliss has been used under multiple administrations for immigration-related operations.</p> <p>Under this Trump administration, the base has reportedly already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention">been used</a> to fly deportees on military aircraft to Guantánamo Bay and Central and South America.</p> <p>Under Joe Biden, it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention">was used</a> as an emergency shelter to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/11/us-migrant-children-opaque-network-facilities">for thousands of unaccompanied migrant</a> children. In 2021, Fort Bliss also reportedly played a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention">key role in resettling Afghan refugees</a> brought to the US after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/afghanistan-us-withdrawal-defeat-watchdog-report-sigar">US withdrawal </a>from Afghanistan. And in 2016, under the Obama administration, Fort Bliss housed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention">several hundred unaccompanied migrant children</a>.</p> <p>The new facility being established at Fort Bliss comes as the Trump administration has sought to use several US military bases around the country as immigration detention facilities.</p> <p>The expansion has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention">faced some criticism from Democrats</a>. Texas representative Veronica Escobar, whose district includes Fort Bliss, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention">warned </a>that using military facilities as immigration detention centers could hurt the effectiveness of US military forces.</p> <p>“It’s not good for our readiness, and it degrades our military,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention">she said</a>.</p> <p>Last month, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, announced <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ice-immigration-hegseth-trump-indiana-new-jersey-cb9a717168655c56d31366b47dba5d7a">that</a> both the Camp Atterbury base in Indiana and the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey could now house detained immigrants.</p> <p>Democrats from both states condemned the move, with New Jersey’s Democratic delegation <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-conaway-new-jersey-congressional-democrats-condemn-defense-secretary-hegseths-decision-to-detain-undocumented-immigrants-at-joint-base-mcguire-dix-lakehurst#:~:text=Using%20our%20country's%20military%20to,tool%20is%20unacceptable%20and%20shameful.%E2%80%9D">warning </a>that “using our country’s military to detain and hold undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way for Ice immigration raids in every New Jersey community”.</p> <p>The planned opening of the new immigration detention facility near El Paso also comes as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/06/physical-sexual-abuse-pregnant-women-children-immigration-centers">a new report released this week by the office of the US senator Jon Ossoff,</a> a Democrat representing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia">Georgia</a>, found and documented hundreds of alleged human rights abuses at immigration detention centers in the US since 20 January 2025.</p> <p>The report cites deaths in custody, physical and sexual abuse of detainees, mistreatment of pregnant women and children, overcrowding and unsanitary living conditions, exposure to extreme temperatures, denial of access to attorneys, child separation, and more.</p> <p>In a statement about the report’s allegations, a spokesperson for the DHS <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/immigration-detention-human-rights-abuses-report-rcna222499">told NBC News</a> that “any claim that there are subprime conditions at Ice detention centers are false”.</p>
