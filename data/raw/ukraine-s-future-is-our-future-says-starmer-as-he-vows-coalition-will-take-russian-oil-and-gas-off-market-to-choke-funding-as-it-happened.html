Earlier this month, he agreed to suspend an unpopular pensions reform so the Socialists could help him survive a confidence vote in parliament.</p> <p>Lecornu has also pledged not to use a constitutional power to ram the budget bill into law without a vote as has been done in previous years.</p> <p>But the Socialists, a swing group in the hung National Assembly, have also demanded a tax on the ultra-rich, which Lecornu has refused and not included in the draft budget.</p> <p>A parliamentary commission earlier this week rejected the proposed budget 37 votes to 11, and it is to go to a debate in the lower house on Friday afternoon.</p> <p>The idea is to make people with at least 100 million euros in assets pay a minimum tax of two percent on that wealth. French economist <strong>Gabriel Zucman</strong> has said such a tax on the mega-wealthy could raise about 20 billion euros (£17.5bn) per year from just 1,800 households. </p> <p>Parliament could discuss a proposal from the left wing to add a so-called Zucman tax on Saturday. But the far right and government are against taxing professional assets, which this tax would target. The government instead wants to tax wealth management holdings with at least five million euros (£4.4m) in assets. The government expects to be able to raise 1 billion euros (£872m) from about 10,000 taxpayers with the measure.</p> <p>Socialist party leader <strong>Olivier Faure</strong> said his party would vote to oust Lecornu’s government if no levy was imposed on the uber-wealthy.</p> <p>“We need to tax the ultra-rich and mega-inheritances,” he said. “If there is no progress by Monday, it will be over.” </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68fb68eb8f0855209aeb0f92" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-24T12:00:56.860Z">1.00pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Four dead, 12 wounded in blast at Ukraine train station</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>A man detonated an explosive device as border guards checked documents at a railway station in northern Ukraine on Friday, killing himself and three women, the State Border Guard Service said.</p> <p>It said in a statement that 12 other people were hurt in the blast at the station in Ovruch, close to the border with Belarus, and that a border guard was among the dead, who were aged 29, 58 and 82.</p> <p>The man who detonated the explosive device was a 23-year-old resident of Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine who had recently been detained for trying to cross the border, it said. </p> <p>It made no mention of any link with Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68fb67bb8f08074f179a6fde" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-24T11:53:11.814Z">12.53pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Zelenskyy arrives at Downing Street</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> has arrived at Downing Street on Friday to meet prime minister <strong>Keir Starmer</strong>, and join other European leaders on a “coalition of the willing” call to discuss boosting Ukraine’s defences.</p>     </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-24T11:58:06.039Z">at 12.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68fb52678f08074f179a6e68" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-24T11:21:40.427Z">12.21pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Ukrainian strikes on Russian refineries drive fuel price rise in Tajikistan, Reuters reports</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil refineries are partly responsible for a rise in fuel prices in Tajikistan, three sources in the Central Asian country’s government told Reuters on Friday.</p> <p>“There is currently a gasoline shortage on the market, which has led to higher prices”, said a source in the Tajik government’s anti-monopoly service.</p> <p>The source said that contracted supplies from Russian producers were not arriving, linking it to strikes on Russian refineries that provide for many of Tajikistan’s fuel needs.

Starmer intends to make the case for using frozen assets to fund Ukraine’s defences.</p> <p>Cabinet Office minister <strong>Nick Thomas-Symonds</strong> told LBC:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We want to try and take Russian oil and gas off the global market.</p> <p>We want also to finish the job on the frozen Russian sovereign assets, essentially so we can use the them to unlock billions of pounds to fund Ukraine’s defences and, thirdly, supplying long-range capabilities.</p> <p>By that, I mean missiles to Ukraine going into the winter months, which obviously has jobs benefits here in the United Kingdom as well.</p> <p>But fundamentally it is about that message to Putin and action to ramp up the pressure. Because it is Putin who is playing for time, Putin who is the one who is not coming to the table and engaging.</p> </blockquote> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever said on Thursday that his country needs concrete and solid guarantees before supporting a plan to use frozen Russian assets to fund a giant loan to Kyiv</strong>, pointing out that the plan is “uncharted territory”. Belgium’s position is critical, as the assets in question are held by Belgian financial institution Euroclear. “Can this (plan) be legal? That is a very good question … There are no clear answers,” De Wever told reporters after attending an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday. “We will in any case be buried in litigation. That seems like a certainty.”<br>EU leaders did not reach an agreement on how to handle the frozen assets during the summit. The issue will be discussed further at the next EU summit in December.</p></li> <li><p><strong>An overnight Ukrainian drone attack injured a young boy and four others in a Moscow suburb, Russian officials said Friday</strong>.

Orban also said that he has talked to Hungary’s oil and gas company MOL on the topic. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed sanctions on Russia for the first time in his second term, targeting Lukoil and Rosneft, signifying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/will-us-sanctions-russia-oil-companies-be-effective-why-trump-now">a major shift in his approach</a> to ending the war.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has said Russia will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/putin-says-he-will-never-bow-to-us-but-concedes-sanctions-may-cause-some-losses">never bow to US pressure</a> but conceded new sanctions could cause some economic pain, </strong>as China and India were reported to be scaling back Russian oil imports after Washington targeted Moscow’s two largest producers. The Russian leader on Thursday described the US sanctions as an “unfriendly act that does nothing to strengthen Russian-American relations” and “an attempt to put pressure on Russia”, which he said was futile. “No self-respecting country ever does anything under pressure,” Putin added in comments to Russian journalists.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-24T10:26:19.311Z">at 11.26am BST</time></p>  </div>
