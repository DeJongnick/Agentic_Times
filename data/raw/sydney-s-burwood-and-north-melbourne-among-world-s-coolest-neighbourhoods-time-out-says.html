<p>One of Sydney’s most culturally diverse suburbs has made it on to Time Out’s annual 39 coolest neighbourhoods list.</p> <p>Burwood, it seems, has come a long way since Frank Lowy opened his first Westfield shopping complex on its main street in the mid 1960s.</p> <p>The inner west suburb was ranked 16th in the world, beating other more globally renowned neighbourhoods such as Shanghai’s French Quarter and Naples’ Quartieri Spagnoli.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Another Australian suburb, North Melbourne, was praised for its “charming village-style vibe” and came in at No 24.</p> <p>A vibrant culture, a dynamic food scene and lively atmosphere <a href="https://www.timeout.com/sydney/news/this-surprising-up-and-coming-sydney-suburb-has-been-named-australias-coolest-neighbourhood-092425">pushed Burwood into the Top 20</a>. The ranking, curated by what Time Out called its “global network of local experts” scores neighbourhoods on their blend of creativity, community, and character.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/25/callan-park-master-plan-hopes-to-turn-former-mental-hospital-site-into-iconic-urban-parkland">Callan Park master plan hopes to turn former psychiatric hospital site into ‘iconic’ urban parkland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Burwood stood out for its exceptional diversity, according to Time Out’s editor-in chief in Australia, Alice Ellis, repeating claims made by Burwood council earlier this year that it was the “fifth-most multicultural suburb in Australia”.</p> <p>Burwood’s mayor, John Faker, said the listing came as “no surprise to us”.</p> <p>“We’re incredibly proud to be named the 16th coolest neighbourhood in the world and the No 1 in Australia for 2025,” he said.</p> <p>“Burwood is Sydney’s cultural playground, a place to eat, play, live, and celebrate the rich cultural offerings of our diverse and vibrant community.”</p> <p>According to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data gathered in the last census, 58% of Burwood residents were born overseas – and almost a third had Chinese ancestry.</p> <p>Bustling night markets, lunar new year festivities and the neighbourhood’s culinary offerings – not just Chinese, but Japanese, south-east Asian, Uyghur, Greek and Italian – received special mention, as did its recently conferred status by the NSW government as a Special Entertainment Precinct, livening up the suburb’s nightlife with relaxed trading and noise rules.</p> <p>The neighbourhood was also praised for its “tranquil charm”, especially in Burwood park, but Appian Way, one of Sydney’s most beautiful and significant heritage streets, wasn’t mentioned.</p> <p>Defying its undeserved reputation as one of the most boring countries in Europe, Belgium’s Borgerhout, in the northern city of Antwerp, came in second, followed by Barra Funda in São Paulo and Camberwell in London.</p> <p><strong>Time Out’s Top 25 coolest neighbourhoods in the world for 2025:</strong></p> <ol> <li><p>Jimbōchō, Tokyo</p></li> <li><p>Borgerhout, Antwerp</p></li> <li><p>Barra Funda, São Paulo</p></li> <li><p>Camberwell, London</p></li> <li><p>Avondale, Chicago</p></li> <li><p>Mullae-dong, Seoul</p></li> <li><p>Ménilmontant, Paris</p></li> <li><p>Nakatsu, Osaka</p></li> <li><p>Vallila, Helsinki</p></li> <li><p>Labone, Accra</p></li> <li><p>Nguyen Thai Binh, Ho Chi Minh</p></li> <li><p>Anjos, Lisbon</p></li> <li><p>Digbeth, Birmingham</p></li> <li><p>Red Hook, New York</p></li> <li><p>Perpetuo Socorro, Medellín</p></li> <li><p><strong>Burwood, Sydney</strong></p></li> <li><p>Linden, Johannesburg</p></li> <li><p>Former French Concession, Shanghai</p></li> <li><p>Quartieri Spagnoli, Naples</p></li> <li><p>Bencoolen, Singapore</p></li> <li><p>Endoume, Marseille</p></li> <li><p>Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montréal</p></li> <li><p>The Liberties, Dublin</p></li> <li><p><strong>North Melbourne, Melbourne</strong></p></li> <li><p>Portales, Mexico City</p></li> </ol>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
