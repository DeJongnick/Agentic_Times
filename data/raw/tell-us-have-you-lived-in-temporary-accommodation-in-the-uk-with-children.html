<p>More than <a href="https://www.crisis.org.uk/about-us/crisis-media-centre/response-to-england-ta-stats-march-to-june-2025-1/">172,000 children</a> were living in temporary accommodation in England at the end of June, according to new quarterly official figures released last week.</p> <p>That represented an 8.2% rise on the same period last year. There are now more than 130,000 households households living in temporary accommodation in England, the figures showed.</p> <p>Matt Downie, chief executive of Crisis, said: “Tragically we have now become totally accustomed to seeing record levels of children growing up in temporary accommodation. We are talking about children with no space to play, no place to do homework, no safe, stable place to call home.”</p> <p>We’d like to find out more about the situation across the UK. Are you a parent who’s living with children in temporary accommodation – or has in the last couple of years?</p> <p>We want to hear from you. How long has it lasted, and what’s been the impact on your family? Have you been moved far away from your children’s school or relatives? Has there been any impact on education or your child’s wellbeing and development?</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="092ce9c3-e2f6-467e-91fa-3dfc926c47d4" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <p><em><strong>If you’re having trouble using the form click <a href="https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/temporary_accommodation_england_form">here</a>.
