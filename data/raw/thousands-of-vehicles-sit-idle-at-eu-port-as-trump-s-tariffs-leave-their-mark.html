<p>The Port of Antwerp-Bruges has been turned into a giant car park with thousands of cars, vans, trucks and tractors bound for the US sitting idle as manufacturers try to avert the worst of Donald Trump’s tariffs.</p> <p>Figures released by the port show a 15.9% drop in the transport of new passenger cars and vans to the US in the first six months of 2025 compared with the same period last year, with a sharp decline emerging in May – one month after the US president announced his “liberation day” tariffs.</p> <p>Exports of trucks and what they call “high and heavy equipment” is down by almost a third at 31.5%.</p> <p>This category includes tractors and construction vehicles, with the fall off in transatlantic movements perhaps reflecting the impact a 25% tariff would have on vehicles that can cost more than $100,000 (£74,430).</p> <p>The port is one of the world’s largest car transport hubs, shipping more than 3m vehicles around the world in 2024.</p> <p>“The outlook for the second half of the year remains uncertain. Much will depend on whether a trade agreement between the EU and the US can be reached by 1 August,” the port said in a statement.</p> <p>European carmakers from Volkswagen to Volvo had been hoping that a deal would have been sealed last week after Trump’s original deadline for a tariff deal with the EU was due to expire.</p> <p>Before Trump arrived in the White House they paid a 2.5% tariff on exports but since April they are being charged an extra 25%, adding tens of thousands of dollars to the price of a family-sized car in the US.</p> <p>Ports across Europe have been tested by Brexit, the coronavirus pandemic, the port congestion caused by container shortages in 2024, with congestion a widespread issue across all northern ports, said Justin Atkin, the UK and Ireland port representative of the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.</p> <p>Compared with Brexit, the tariff impact has been “more of an instant shock” he said.</p> <p>“With the pandemic, we had lockdown, then we were out of lockdown, then back into lockdown, and people got used to managing it after being unprepared. Whereas here … people have talked about tariffs in the build up [to Trump] but I don’t think anyone expected the level and the severity of the instantaneous action.”</p> <p>The port couldn’t put a figure on the number of cars waiting to be transported but said it was in the thousands.</p> <p>Atkin said there was also evidence of Chinese cars being stockpiled at the port, which may reflect a diversion of trade from the US with Beijing grappling with tariff barriers.</p> <p>Separately, disruption to docking schedules caused by diversions due<br>to the conflict in the Red Sea, plus the increased size of ships in<br>global fleets, has meant containers are remaining at the port for up to<br>eight days instead of the usual five.</p> <p>The US is the Port of Antwerp-Bruges’s second-biggest trading partner after the UK and there is evidence that US exporters are also front-loading cargo to try to avoid any retaliatory tariffs that the EU may impose in the event of a trade war.</p> <p>In the first half of the year, inbound cargo from the US increased by 17% with higher volumes of liquefied natural gas.</p>
