<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> singled me out. In fact, I was the first example he gave of someone ruining women’s sport.</p> <p>“Last year”, he said while announcing his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports/">Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports executive order</a>, “a male cyclist posing as a woman competed in the 800-mile Arizona Trail Race – a very big deal in cycling – and obliterated the women’s course record by nearly five and a half hours.”</p> <p>He’s right: I did snag the record from Alex Schultz (a man) who had previously bested the record held by Lael Wilcox (a woman). A few months after my effort, all of our paces were shattered by a Lithuanian ultra-distance phenom.</p> <p>You see, my interest in this event was spurred by its co-ed leaderboard. Events like the Arizona Trail Race are not bound by governing bodies in any traditional sense. The rules boil down to little more than “<a href="https://azt300-800.com/rules/">pedal alone and in good faith under your own power</a>”. An event that involves riding across the length of Arizona and traversing the Grand Canyon with a bicycle on your back is as much a competition as an actualizing exercise for the masochists who choose to sublimate through sport.</p>    <p>Not that it got me anywhere, financially.<strong> </strong>My fleeting record run was the talk of two niche cycling publications, a few subreddits, and generated enough clout for an REI cashier to grant me a full refund on a pair of absolutely destroyed shoe gaiters. It failed to secure me anything meaningful like industry sponsorships – tangible support that would have made my pursuits in sport tenable.</p> <p>Instead, my wins<strong> </strong>only served to generate more artifacts for the right’s culture wars, while I remained unable to garner even a sliver of the institutional recognition that friends and fellow competitors with similar palmares have found.</p> <p>Transgender people lost the inclusion battle in sport ages ago. International governing bodies for competitions in <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/world-athletics-banned-transgender-women-competing-does-science-support-rule">running</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/world-cyclings-governing-body-bans-transgender-athletes-womens-events-rcna94289">cycling</a>, <a href="https://doc.fide.com/docs/DOC/2FC2023/CM2_2023_45.pdf">chess</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-swimmers-new-rules-fina-world-governing-body-c17e99d3121fa964336458b57ae266f7">swimming</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c10l58zd059o">darts</a> and more have repeatedly caved to pressure and helped shift the Overton window to exclude trans people from public life more broadly. The world’s least gracious winners insist on kicking sand in our eyes.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/trump-trans-athletes-ban">Trump’s executive order</a> is a perfect scam: he and his acolytes get to talk endlessly about the fake specter of trans athletes “invading” women’s sports, while never putting any of their attention, immense political cache and funding access towards things that would meaningfully elevate the state of women’s sports. Instead, they get to fixate their hate and attention on every transsexual woman who dares show up to a rec T-ball league with her friends.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the women who simply want to compete and labor as athletes are left in the cold.</p> <p>In my field of cycling, conditions haven’t been this dire in ages if you’re a woman in the US trying to progress to the vaunted European peloton. Last year saw the shuttering of two institutions: the <a href="https://www.joemartinstagerace.com/47-uncategorised/218-race-postponed-until-2025">Joe Martin Stage Race</a> went from postponed to falling off the <a href="https://www.uci.org/calendar/road/2ruOnavHX0dMGTCRozdYAU?discipline=ROA&amp;country=USA">calendar </a>after 46 years, and the longest-running women’s professional team, DNA Pro Cycling, <a href="https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/dna-pro-cycling-discloses-us-womens-team-will-cease-operations-at-end-of-2024/">closed up shop </a>after 12 years of being the premier pipeline for American women hoping to advance to the international peloton. For women looking for a team or a race that could potentially catapult their career forward, things are the worst they have been in the <a href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/there-are-fewer-elite-teams-than-there-have-ever-been-in-the-last-10-years-jakroo-launches-womens-composite-team-to-bolster-struggling-u-s-road-scene">last decade</a>.</p>    <p>Consider this: when you watch a professional race, it’s common for an announcer to regale spectators with the resumes of the women on the start line. Many of them are record-shattering athletes <em>and</em> also hold full-time jobs as doctors, researchers or <a href="https://voxwomen.com/capitaltocycling/">investment bankers</a>. These remarks always come in good faith, but as a means of contrasting us against the men – who usually have enough money and support thrown behind them to make a living as athletes – they speak to the sad state of affairs in women’s sport. <br><br>And soon, things for women’s sports will get even worse. Because it bears repeating, as clearly as possible: their project contains no measures that help female athletes at the professional level as laborers, and certainly nothing that even gestures towards new investment opportunities for girls pursuing their dream. It’s a free market that devalues women’s labor at every turn.</p> <p>In fact, the only action items referencing funding simply establishes a precedent for <em>rescinding</em> money from organizations investing in women and girls who have given their lives and bodies to sport. In this new reality, all women lose. In fact, everyone loses – except for the people cashing checks and amassing political power.</p> <p>They found a scapegoat, and all they have done is enrich themselves with <a href="https://www.allamericanspeakers.com/speakers/461525/Riley-Gaines">five-figure speaking fee tours</a>, while taking the oxygen out of the room. The only lane they’ve made is one that encourages women to quit competing for <a href="https://glaad.org/gap/organization/save-womens-sports/">a life of news appearances and college campus speaking tours</a>.</p> <p>They are, for lack of a better word, cowards who don’t want to do the actual work of empowering and supporting athletes.</p> <p>So my argument is quite simple. Maybe you take umbrage with trans people in sports, and in turn me (whatever, you won that battle). But if you purport to care about women’s sports, about girls getting a fair chance at competing, you need to ask yourself why, at the height of a historic moment of sweeping and unchecked austerity measures, the loudest and wealthiest people in the room have built a movement that culminated in this: an executive order that establishes a precedent to strip funding away from women in sport.</p>
