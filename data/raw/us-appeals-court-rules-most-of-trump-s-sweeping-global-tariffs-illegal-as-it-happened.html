 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>This concludes our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the day. Here are the latest developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>A federal appeals court ruled that most of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s tariffs are illegal, but can stay in effect until 14 October, to give time for a supreme court appeal.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump suggested that the court decision, which affirmed a lower court ruling in May, could spell the end of the United States of America, but added that he expects the supreme court to help him win.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Charles</strong> <strong>Borges</strong>, chief data officer of the Social Security Administration, resigned after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging that more than 300 million Americans’ Social Security data was put at risk by staffers from Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, who uploaded sensitive information to an insecure cloud server.</p></li> 
   <li><p>In 2014, <strong>Jim O’Neill</strong>, the former biotech investor and current deputy health secretary who was named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week, suggested that the FDA should just let people use drugs before doing any research to show that they work.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The Missouri governor, <strong>Mike Kehoe</strong>, has moved to help the Republican party gain an additional seat in Congress, calling a special legislative session to redraw congressional districts in his state.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The homeland security secretary, <strong>Kristi Noem</strong>, fired two dozen “deep-state” employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s information technology department, including its top leaders, following what she called an unspecified “breach” of its network by a “threat actor”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>A federal appeals court in San Francisco blocked Noem from moving ahead with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/22/temporary-protected-status-tps-immigration-trump">her plan</a> to strip temporary protected status from 600,000 Venezuelans who have permission to live and work in the United States amid turmoil in their homeland.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Social Security whistleblower who says DOGE mishandled sensitive data resigns</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Charles</strong> <strong>Borges</strong>, chief data officer of the Social Security Administration, resigned on Friday due to what he called the agency’s actions against him since he filed a whistleblower complaint this week.</p> 
  <p>In his complaint, Borges alleged that more than 300 million Americans’ Social Security data was put at risk by staffers from Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” who uploaded sensitive information to a cloud account not subject to oversight.<br><br>“I have suffered exclusion, isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear, creating a hostile work environment and making work conditions intolerable,” Borges wrote in <a href="https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bpRYEnf-Imgur.jpg">his resignation letter</a>.<br><br>The Project Government Accountability Office, which is representing him in his whistleblower case, posted the letter on its website.<br><br>Borges’ attorney said he “no longer felt that he could continue to work for the Social Security Administration in good conscience, given what he had witnessed.” It added that he would continue to work with the proper oversight bodies.</p> 
  <p><strong>Edward Coristine</strong>, a 19-year-old software engineer, was among the Doge officials named by Borges as part of the project to duplicate Americans’ Social Security data and put it on an insecure server.</p> 
  <p>It was Coristine’s recent beating, by two 15-year-olds on a Washington DC street, that Donald Trump used as a pretext for his federal takeover of the capital’s policing.<br><br></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Jim O'Neill, biotech investor to lead CDC, argued FDA should approve drugs before finding out if they work</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Jim O’Neill</strong>, the former biotech investor and current deputy health secretary who was named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week, might lack any experience in health care, but he does have a lot of opinions about the regulation of medicine as a business that could soon be very important.</p> 
  <p>In 2014, when O’Neill was managing director of Mithril Capital Management, a “family of long-term venture capital funds” founded by <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>, he represented Thiel on the board of the <a href="https://sens.org/">SENS Research Foundation</a>, an organization dedicated to finding treatments for aging, with Thiel’s financial support.</p> 
  <p>That year, when O’Neill <a href="https://youtu.be/9Y7oazjaSyE?si=H1mZiX7c7YeD1HG8&amp;t=1086">gave a talk</a> at at the foundation’s “rejuvenation biotechnology” conference, he argued that development of drugs that might slow or reverse human aging was slowed down by the Food and Drug Administration’s efforts to ensure that drugs are safe and effective.</p> 
  <p>Instead of making sure that drugs work before approving their use by the public, O’Neill said, the FDA should adopt of a system its proponents call “progressive approval”.</p> 
  <p>“We should reform FDA, so that it is approving drugs after their sponsors have demonstrated safety and let people start using them, at their own risk, but not much risk of safety”, O’Neill said. “But let’s prove efficacy after they’ve been legalized”.</p>

  <p>O’Neill, who was standing in front of a slide on how much less efficient biotech startups were than software startups, taken from a book by Peter Thiel and <a href="https://x.com/bgmasters/status/1445208944184487937">Blake Masters</a>, got a round of applause for the observation.</p> 
  <p>As <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/30/1119449/hhs-robert-f-kennedy-jr-jim-oneill-longevity-maha/">Jessica Hamzelou reported</a> in the MIT Technology Review in June, O’Neill was suggesting that drugs be made available to the public “after the very first stage of clinical testing, which is designed to test whether a new treatment is safe. These tests are typically small and don’t reveal whether the drug actually works.”</p> 
  <p>That idea is popular though in the longevity community that O’Neill’s patron Thiel is at the center of.</p> 
  <p>It has also been proposed by O’Neill’s current boss, <strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr</strong>. In May, Kennedy <a href="https://www.theultimatehuman.com/podcast-episodes/robert-f-kennedy-jr-how-to-fix-americas-health-crisis-as-hhs-secretary">told a longevity podcaster</a> that he wanted to make it easier for people to experiment with treatments that might, or might not, work. “If you want to take an experimental drug … you ought to be able to do that”, Kennedy said.</p> 
  <p>But ditching FDA’s gold-standard of phase 2 and phase 3 trials strikes others as unethical. “It’s just absurd to think that the regulatory agency that’s responsible for making sure that products are safe and effective before they’re made available to patients couldn’t protect patients from charlatans: <strong>Holly Fernandez Lynch</strong>, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told MIT Technology Review. “It’s just like a complete dereliction of duty.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Nobel laureate in economics skeptical of Trump's claim court ruling on tariffs could 'literally destroy the United States of America'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, mocked Donald Trump, the Nobel prize-wanting president, for <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115114339832960282">his hyperbolic claim</a>, after a court ruled that his tariffs are almost all illegal, that “this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America” unless it is overturned.</p> 
  <p>“Yep, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,” <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/an-emergency-non-emergency-post">Krugman wrote on Substack</a>. “Take away these tariffs, and the county will revert to the blasted wasteland it was on … April 1, just before Trump made his big tariff announcement.”</p> 
  <p>Krugman added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s important to be clear what just happened. The court didn’t say that tariffs per se are illegal. It said that the procedure Trump used to impose tariffs — declaring an economic emergency, then setting tariff rates without so much as consulting Congress, let alone passing legislation — is illegal. If Trump wants to pass a tariff bill, the same way he passed his One Big Beautiful Bill, OK. (I mean, terrible policy, but legal.)</p> 
   <p>But just saying “I am the Tariff Man, and here are my tariffs” isn’t OK.</p> 
   <p>True, the International Economic Emergency Powers Act gives the president substantial room to set tariffs during an, um, economic emergency. But Trump himself keeps saying that the economy is in wonderful shape, booming without inflation, and any claims to the contrary are fake news. So how can things both be terrific and an emergency calling for drastic action?</p>

  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> has said his tariffs are about winning. But in response to his appeals court setback on Friday, California governor <strong>Gavin Newsom </strong><a href="https://x.com/CAgovernor/status/1961571983512277298">declared</a>: “Trump is America’s biggest loser.”</p> 
  <p>Newsom and the state’s attorney general <strong>Rob Bonta</strong> have filed a separate lawsuit against Trump’s so-called “reciprocal” tariffs, which similarly argues the president lacks the authority to unilaterally impose levies through the IEEPA. That suit alleges that Trump’s global trade war has caused “immediate and irreparable harm” to the state – the world’s fourth largest economy.</p> 
  <p>“And while Trump might be America’s biggest loser, it’s everyday Americans who are paying the price for his failed economic policies,” Newsom said. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Missouri's Republican governor moves to gerrymander state, as Trump demands</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Missouri governor, Mike Kehoe, has moved to help the Republican party gain an additional seat in Congress, calling a special legislative session to redraw congressional districts in his state.</p> 
  <p>Kehoe’s <a href="https://x.com/GovMikeKehoe/status/1961538399229075941">announcement</a> on Friday followed a pressure campaign from Donald Trump, who has urged Republican states to reshape district boundaries to more heavily favor Republicans, boosting the party’s chances of maintaining control of the House of Representatives in 2026, despite the unpopularity of his policies.</p> 
  <p>The announcement came hours after Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, <a href="https://x.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1961456577078067685">signed into law</a> a new congressional map designed to help Republicans gain five more House seats in next year’s elections without winning more votes.</p> 
  <p>Trump has also pushed Indiana lawmakers to redraw that state’s maps, and has also pushed lawmakers in Florida and Ohio to help add three or more Republican-leaning seats.</p> 
  <p>Trump celebrated what <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115114270276925608">he called</a> the prospect of “a new, much fairer, and much improved, Congressional Map, that will give the incredible people of Missouri the tremendous opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections”.</p> 
  <p>Democratic congressman Emanuel Cleaver, whose district, which includes part of Kansas City, might be redrawn to make his re-election unlikely, denounced the proposed new map as much less fair.</p> 
  <p>“This attempt to gerrymander Missouri will not simply change district lines, it will silence voices. It will deny representation. It will tell the people of Missouri that their lawmakers no longer wish to earn their vote, that elections are predetermined by the power brokers in Washington,” Cleaver said in <a href="https://cleaver.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-cleavers-statement-condemning-special-session-begin-mid">a statement</a>.</p> 
  <p>“Roughly 40% of Missourians cast their ballots for Democratic candidates last year, and they deserve representation in the People’s House just as much as our Republican neighbors.”</p> 
  <p>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) pointed to a proposal to create a new Republican majority seat by splitting heavily Democratic Kansas City.</p> 
  <p>“Republicans are running scared, and they’ve decided their only hope for maintaining their majority is to pursue a cynical, unpopular scheme to gerrymander congressional maps,” Suzan DelBene, a Washington congresswoman who chairs the DCCC said.</p> 
  <p>“The Missouri constitution, business and community leaders, and common sense all support the idea of Kansas City remaining one, compact congressional district. Donald Trump and DC Republicans’ desire to hold on to power are the only rationale for this re-draw.”</p>

  <p>“For the second time in this case, a federal court has held that the President’s so-called ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs are unlawful,” Jeffrey Schwab, director of litigation for the not-for-profit legal center said. “The President cannot lawfully impose tariffs on his own; and IEEPA does not give him unlimited unilateral tariff authority. This decision protects American businesses and consumers from the uncertainty and harm caused by these unlawful tariffs.”</p> 
  <p>“The decision today is a powerful reaffirmation of our nation’s core constitutional commitments from our nation’s founders, especially the principle that presidents must act within the rule of law,” Katyal said. “It is that commitment to the rule of law that brought my parents, and millions of others, to this country, and which stands as a beacon of freedom and hope around the globe.”</p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/jbDDyApH7AQ?si=UN6oPzxNNWYUbUYD&amp;t=133">an interview</a> with MSNBC later on Friday, Katyal pointed out that Trump appeared to acknowledge during his first term that the constitution gave the power to impose tariffs to Congress. “He went and asked Congress for the authority to tariff and they said no. So President Trump this time around just did it on his own”, Katyal said.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The US court of appeals for the federal circuit, which ruled on Friday that most of Donald Trump’s tariffs are illegal, will allow the import taxes to stay in effect until 14 October, to give the president time to appeal to the supreme court.</p> 
  <p>After ruling, 7-4, that the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs imposed by Trump are not legal, the court <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70394463/161/vos-selections-inc-v-trump/">paused its order</a> until that date.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump says we will win tariff fight 'with the help of the United States Supreme Court'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Donald Trump broke his uncharacteristic silence on the news in recent days by <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115114339832960282">posting</a> an outraged reaction to the federal appeals court ruling that most of his tariffs are illegal.</p> 
  <p>The president’s post, which was <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1961552377246548224">shared</a> on an official White House account, began with the all-caps declaration: “ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!”</p> 
  <p>The court ruling against Trump did say that the tariffs can remain in place until 14 October, giving his administration time to appeal to the supreme court.</p> 
  <p>“Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end,” Trump added in his response.</p> 
  <p>The president was quite clear about what he sees as the vehicle for bringing about his preferred end, being granted the power to impose taxes reserved in the US constitution for Congress.</p> 
  <p>“For many years, Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians,” Trump wrote. “Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation.”</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> overstepped his presidential powers with most of his globe-rattling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs">tariff policies</a>, a federal appeals court in Washington DC<strong> </strong>ruled on Friday.</p> 
  <p>US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax”, the court said.</p> 
  <p>The court’s decision will likely mean that the supreme court will have to rule on whether Trump has the legal right as president to upend US trade policy. The court also said the ruling wouldn’t take effect until 14 October.</p> 
  <p>Trump has claimed he has the right to impose tariffs on trading partners under the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45618">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a> (IEEPA), which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has and cited various national emergencies – including US trade deficits with trading partners, fentanyl trafficking and immigration – as the reasons for the actions.</p> 
  <p>But a group of small businesses have challenged the administration’s arguments, arguing they are “<a href="https://libertyjusticecenter.org/cases/v-o-s-selections-inc-v-trump/">devastating small businesses across the country</a>.”</p> 
  <p>And on Friday, the appellate court ruled: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Federal appeals court rules that most of Trump's tariffs are illegal</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A US appeals court ruled on Friday that most of Donald Trump’s new tariffs are illegal, upholding a ruling from the federal court of international trade that the president’s declaration of an economic emergency to justify sweeping tariffs violates a 1977 law and the US constitution, which reserves taxation for the Congress.</p> 
  <p>As our colleague <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-tariffs-illegal-appeal-court-ruling">Dominic Rushe explains</a>, the New York-based US court of international trade previously ruled against Trump’s tariff policies in May, saying the president had exceeded his authority when he imposed both sets of challenged tariffs. The three-judge panel included a judge who was appointed by Trump in his first term.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cafc.23105/gov.uscourts.cafc.23105.159.0_1.pdf">split decision</a> from the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington DC addressed the legality of what Trump calls “reciprocal” tariffs imposed as part of his trade war in April, as well as a separate set of tariffs imposed in February against China, Canada and Mexico.</p> 
  <p>The court ruled that the president does have the legal authority to impose narrow, sectoral tariffs, like those on steel and aluminum imports, but he far exceeded his power with the global tariffs on imports he first declared in April.</p> 
  <p>The case, which is expected to be appealed to the US supreme court, hinges of Trump’s broad interpretation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).</p> 
  <p>That law gives the president the power to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during national emergencies, which previous presidents haver used to sanction enemies or freeze their assets.</p> 
  <p>Trump, the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, has claimed the import taxes were justified given trade imbalances, declining US manufacturing power and the cross-border flow of drugs.</p> 
  <p>The law does not mention tariffs, although it allows the president to take a wide range of actions in response to a crisis. Trump’s justice department has argued that the law allows tariffs under emergency provisions that authorize a president to “regulate” imports or block them completely.</p> 
  <p>In ruling against Trump’s interpretation of the law, the court’s majority writes: “we discern no clear congressional authorization by IEEPA for tariffs of the magnitude of the Reciprocal Tariffs and Trafficking Tariffs. Reading the phrase ‘regulate … importation’ to include imposing these tariffs is ‘a wafer-thin reed on which to rest such sweeping power.’”</p> 
  <p>In one of the opinions upholding the lower court’s finding that Trump exceeded his authority, the judges write: “Under the Government’s view, the President could make such a factual finding by merely pointing to a lack of taxes paid on imports from outside the country. But if the President can declare an emergency to cut the deficit by raising taxes in whatever way he wishes, not much remains of Congressional authority over taxation.”</p> 
  <p>The appeals court ruled on two cases, one brought by five small businesses and the other by 12 Democratic-led US states, which argued that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs.</p> 
  <p>The US constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs, and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited, according to the lawsuits.</p> 
  <p>Another court in Washington DC ruled that IEEPA does not authorize Trump’s tariffs, and the government has appealed that decision as well. At least eight lawsuits have challenged Trump’s tariff policies, including one filed by the state of California.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Noem fires two dozen IT workers after 'breach' of Federal Emergency Management Agency’s network</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The homeland security secretary, <strong>Kristi Noem</strong>, fired two dozen “deep-state” employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s information technology department on Friday, including its top leaders, following what she called an unspecified “breach” of its network by a “threat actor”.</p> 
  <p>“While conducting a routine cybersecurity review, the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) discovered significant security vulnerabilities that gave a threat actor access to FEMA’s network”, the homeland security department said in <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/08/29/secretary-noem-terminates-inept-fema-employees-after-uncovering-massive-cyber">a statement</a>. “The investigation uncovered several severe lapses in security that allowed the threat actor to breach FEMA’s network and threaten the entire Department and the nation as a whole.”</p> 
  <p>The statement said that Fema’s chief information officer, <a href="https://www.fema.gov/about/organization/charles-charlie-r-armstrong">Charlie Armstrong</a>, chief information security officer, <a href="https://www.fema.gov/about/organization/dr-gregory-edwards">Greg Edwards</a>, and 22 other IT employees “directly responsible” were fired.</p> 
  <p>“FEMA’s career IT leadership failed on every level. Their incompetence put the American people at risk”, Noem said. “When DHS stepped in to fix the problem, entrenched bureaucrats worked to prevent us from solving the problem and downplayed just how bad this breach was. These deep-state individuals were more interested in covering up their failures than in protecting the Homeland and American citizens’ personal data, so I terminated them immediately.”</p> 
  <p>The firings came minutes after the department released a long statement attacking the federal emergency management agency that Donald Trump is pushing to close. “FEMA has failed Americans for decades”, the department’s official X account <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1961528149017260477">posted</a> at the start of a thread deriding the agency, in which is claimed that “the Biden administration hijacked FEMA to resettle illegal aliens”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Appeals court blocks Noem from revoking temporary protected status from 600,000 Venezuelans</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A federal appeals court in San Francisco has blocked homeland security secretary Kristi Noem from moving ahead with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/22/temporary-protected-status-tps-immigration-trump">her plan</a> to strip temporary protected status from 600,000 Venezuelans who have permission to live and work in the United States amid turmoil in their homeland.</p> 
  <p>A three-judge panel of the 9th US circuit court of appeals unanimously upheld a lower court ruling that maintained temporary protected status for Venezuelans while TPS holders challenge actions by Trump’s administration in court.</p> 
  <p>The judges found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that Noem had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior extension of temporary protected status by the Biden administration because the governing statute written by Congress does not permit it.</p> 
  <p>“In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics,” judge Kim Wardlaw, who was nominated by Bill Clinton, a Democrat, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.9315046b-13e6-4ea7-9379-8dc03f5d750e/gov.uscourts.ca9.9315046b-13e6-4ea7-9379-8dc03f5d750e.98.1.pdf">wrote</a> for the panel.</p> 
  <p>The ruling concluded:</p> 
  <p>“The TPS statute is designed to constrain the Executive, creating predictable periods of safety and legal status for TPS beneficiaries. Sudden reversals of prior decisions contravene the statute’s plain language and purpose. Here, hundreds of thousands of people have been stripped of status and plunged into uncertainty. The stability of TPS has been replaced by fears of family separation, detention, and deportation. Congress did not contemplate this, and the ongoing irreparable harm to Plaintiffs warrants a remedy pending a final adjudication on the merits.”<br><br>A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told the Associated Press decision was made by “unelected activist” judges and claimed that, for decades, “the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program.”<br><br>Congress authorized temporary protected status, or TPS, as part of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/358">the Immigration Act of 1990</a>, which increased the limits on legal immigration to the United States and was signed into law by a Republican president, George H.W. Bush.</p> 
  <p>The law established “a program for granting temporary protected status and work authorization to aliens in the United States who are nationals of countries designated by the Attorney General to be subject to armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary temporary conditions.” The statute also made clear that it “Prohibits deportation during the period in which such status is in effect.”</p>

  <p>Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, just spoke with reporters at the White House.

  <p>Miller alleged that these cities do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), even when an immigrant commits a crime, saying they don’t comply with detainers issued by Ice.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In a week of chaos at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s health secretary, <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, has continued to make questionable medical and health claims</strong> – and has been slammed for them by experts and lawmakers alike.</p> 
  <p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/minneapolis-active-shooter-school">the deadly mass school shooting in Minneapolis </a>this week <strong>where two children were killed and 17 others injured</strong>, Kennedy suggested that psychiatric drugs may be contributing to the rise in gun violence across the country.</p> 
  <p>During an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends, the host Brian Kilmeade asked Kennedy if the health department was investigating whether medications used to treat gender dysphoria might be linked to school shootings.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/minnneapolis-wakes-to-aftermath-of-catholic-school-shooting">According to</a> court documents reviewed by the Guardian, the 23-year-old shooter, Robin Westman, had changed their birth name from Robert to Robin because they identified as a woman.</p> 
  <p>In response to Kilmeade’s question, Kennedy, without acknowledging the prevalence and easy accessibility of firearms across the US – said that his department was “launching studies on the potential contribution of some of the SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors] drugs and some of the other psychiatric drugs that might be contributing to violence”.</p> 
  <p><strong>This week, Kennedy also suggested that he could identify “mitochondrial challenges” in children at airports just by looking at them</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Speaking at an event in Texas alongside the state’s governor, <strong>Greg Abbott,</strong> Kennedy claimed: “I’m looking at kids as I walk through the airports today, as I walk down the street, and I see these kids that are just overburdened with mitochondrial challenges, with inflammation. You can tell from their faces, from their body movements, and from their lack of social connection. And I know that that’s not how our children are supposed to look.”</p> 
  <p>In response, <strong>Ashish Jha</strong>, former White House Covid-19 response coordinator under the Biden administration, <a href="https://x.com/ashishkjha/status/1960897339968614834">said:</a> “I’m sorry but what?”</p> 
  <p><strong>“This is wacky, flat-earth, voodoo stuff, people. This is not normal,”</strong> Jha added on X.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The administration is planning to ramp up immigration enforcement in Boston, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/29/trump-admin-plans-immigration-enforcement-surge-in-boston-00536276">Politico is reporting</a>, citing a current and former administration official.</p> 
  <p>According to the official, <strong>the latest plans are subject to change, but would involve an increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) personnel in the city.</strong></p> 
  <p>Boston mayor <strong>Michelle Wu</strong>, a Democrat, has pushed back against the Trump administration, and said the city would “not back down” from engaging in “sanctuary city policies” outlined by the justice department, including limiting city police from helping Ice agents make arrests.</p> 
  <p>Last week, acting Ice director <strong>Todd Lyons</strong> also said the increase in immigration enforcement was coming. “Sanctuary does not mean safer streets. It means more criminal aliens out and about the neighborhood. But 100%, you will see a larger Ice presence,” Lyons said in a radio interview.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, border czar <strong>Tom Homan</strong> said this week that immigration raids across several Democratic-led cities would take place after Labor Day.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Donald Trump said he would not be spending $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid, <a href="https://x.com/WHOMB/status/1961410044907458780">in a letter </a>to Republican house speaker Mike Johnson.</p> 
  <p>The rare move, known as a <strong>“pocket </strong><strong>rescission”</strong>, is a request to Congress for the president to not spend appropriated funds towards the end of the fiscal year –which ends on 30 September. Normally, the law stipulates that funding can be paused for 45 days while congress considers such a request. But <strong>a pocket </strong><strong>rescission means that lawmakers don’t have enough time to act before the funds expire</strong>. This would be the first time a president has used the provision <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1961465751996449097">in 50 years</a>.</p> 
  <p>It’s already attracted ire from several legislators. <strong>Susan Collins</strong>, the Republican senator from Maine who chairs the appropriations committee called the president’s actions a “clear violation of the law”.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, Democrats decried Trump’s actions. Senator <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong>, the ranking member of the finance committee, said the president is a “wannabe king is defunding support that prevents hunger and sickness worldwide”, while congressman <strong>Joaquin Castro</strong> of Texas said the decision to scrap billions in foreign funding was “wrong and illegal”, and urged his Republican colleagues to “say hell no”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">US air force offers military funeral honors to slain January 6 rioter</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The US air force has said it is offering military funeral honors to <strong>Ashli Babbitt</strong>, a supporter of <strong>Donald Trump</strong> who was shot and killed by a police officer during the 6 January 2021, attack on the US Capitol.</p> 
  <p>Babbitt, 35, a US air force veteran who lived in California, was fatally shot in the shoulder while she tried to enter a room near the House of Representatives during the riot.</p> 
  <p>“After reviewing the circumstances of [senior airman] Babbitt’s death, the Air Force has offered Military Funeral Honors to [senior airman] Babbitt’s family,” the air force said in a statement seen by Reuters.</p> 
  <p>The funeral honors would mark the latest gesture of support from Trump’s administration toward those who stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying his 2020 election loss. Trump has repeatedly made false claims that his 2020 loss to <strong>Joe Biden</strong> was due to voter fraud.</p> 
  <p><strong>He and his supporters have sought to portray Babbitt as a martyr</strong> who was unjustly killed as she attempted to climb through a broken window of a barricaded door leading to the speaker’s lobby, a few feet from where members of Congress were waiting to be evacuated to safety during the attack.</p> 
  <p>An internal investigation by the US Capitol Police <strong>cleared the officer who shot Babbitt of wrongdoing in 2021</strong> and said he would not face internal discipline. More than 1,500 people were criminally charged for participating in the riot. Trump pardoned nearly all of them, and released those who had been imprisoned.</p>

  <p>A controversial portrait of <strong>General Robert E Lee</strong>, which shows an enslaved man holding the Confederate leader’s horse, is being returned to the library at West Point, according to Pentagon officials who spoke with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/us/politics/pentagon-trump-confederate-lee-west-point.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">New York Times</a>.</p> 
  <p>The nearly 20ft canvas, which had hung in the US military academy since 1952, was removed following a 2020 law that ordered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/29/confederate-monument-replacements">Confederate names and tributes</a> to be stripped from military installations.</p> 
  <p>That same law established a commission to rename bases and review monuments. By 2022, the commission directed West Point to clear away all items that “commemorate or memorialize the Confederacy”. Shortly after, the Lee portrait was taken down and placed in storage.</p> 
  <p>Exactly how the painting is being reinstalled without countering the legislation remains uncertain. The measure was passed in the wake of nationwide demonstrations after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd">George Floyd</a>’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police.</p> 
  <p>Both <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and the defense secretary, <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>, have pushed for the restoration of Confederate symbols that were removed in recent years. Hegseth, in particular, has pressed for reinstating a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/13/arlington-national-cemetery-confederate-memorial">Confederate memorial</a> at Arlington national cemetery that Congress recommended removing. In an August social media post, he wrote that the statue “never should have been taken down by woke lemmings”.</p> 
  <p>Hegseth <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/20/pete-hegseth-fort-bragg-fort-benning-confederates">moved to reinstate</a> Confederate general names at army bases such as <strong>Fort Bragg</strong> and <strong>Fort Lee</strong> earlier this summer, but did so in a way that attempted to stay within the boundaries of the 2020 law. The new names honored different soldiers, none of whom had fought for the Confederacy, yet the names were the same as those of the original Confederate honorees.</p>

  <p>In response to Abbott’s signing of the gerrymandered map pushed by Trump into law, <strong>Texas Democratic party chairman Kendall Scudder</strong> issued this statement:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>With a stroke of the pen, Greg Abbott and the Republicans have <strong>effectively surrendered Texas to Washington, DC</strong>. They love to boast about how “Texas Tough” they are, but when <strong>Donald Trump made one call, they bent over backwards to prioritize his politics over Texan</strong>s. Honestly, it’s pathetic.</p> 
   <p>I am proud of the Texas Democrats in the House and Senate who chose to fight, whether by a constitutionally protected quorum break, questioning these mapmakers, trying to pass amendments, or even attempting to filibuster.</p> 
   <p><strong>This isn’t over – we’ll see these clowns in court.</strong> We aren’t done fighting against these <strong>racially discriminatory maps</strong>, and fully expect the letter of the law to prevail over these sycophantic Republican politicians who think the rules don’t apply to them.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Texas governor signs new redistricting bill, setting up loss of Democratic seats in US House</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/texas">Texas</a>’s governor, <strong>Greg Abbott</strong>, has signed a new redistricting bill that will <strong>redraw the state’s congressional map to heavily favor Republicans</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Abbott signed today the highly controversial bill which prompted state <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> to stage a weeks-long walkout earlier this month.</p> 
  <p>In a video on X, Abbott can be seen signing the bill and says it “creates the one big, beautiful map that ensures fairer representation in the United States Congress for Texas”.</p> 
  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1961456577078067685"> 
   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, I signed the One Big Beautiful Map into law. <br><br>This map ensures fairer representation in Congress. <br><br>Texas will be more RED in Congress. <a href="https://t.co/aOT7QCoSF8">pic.twitter.com/aOT7QCoSF8</a></p>— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1961456577078067685?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2025</a>
   </blockquote> 
  </figure> 
  <p>Abbott’s signing comes after the Texas house of representatives approved the new map – which is <strong>set to create as many as five additional Republican congressional districts</strong> – on an 88-52 party-line vote. The state senate then approved the bill early on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>After the house’s <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2025/aug/20/texas-house-redistricting-bill-floor">approval,</a> <strong>Donald Trump</strong> took to Truth Social and wrote: “Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!! Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself.”</p> 
  <p>“Texas never lets us down. Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same thing,” he added.</p> 
  <p>The bill’s passage <strong>follows Trump’s request for the state to draw new congressional maps</strong>. Currently, 25 of Texas’s 38 districts have Republican majorities. The new redistricting will bring the Republican-favored districts to 30.</p> 
  <p>The new districting plans will <strong>remove Democratic-majority districts in several major cities including Houston, Austin and the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex</strong>.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The US is denying and revoking visas from members of the <strong>Palestine Liberation Organization</strong> and <strong>the Palestinian Authority</strong> ahead of the United Nations general assembly meeting in September, the US state department has said in a statement.</p> 
  <p>The restrictions mean that Palestinian Authority president <strong>Mahmoud Abbas</strong> would likely not be able to travel to New York to deliver an address to the annual gathering, as he typically does, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>It <strong>follows the imposition of US sanctions</strong> on Palestinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization in July, even as other western powers have moved toward recognition of Palestinian statehood.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, the state department said that “it is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace”.</p> 
  <p>Officials with the Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, reject that they have undermined peace prospects, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>Under the 1947 UN “headquarters agreement” the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York. But Washington has said it can deny visas for security, terrorism and foreign policy reasons.</p> 
  <p>The state department said that the Palestinian Authority’s mission to the UN would not be included in the restrictions. It did not elaborate.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joni-ernst-wont-seek-reelection-to-senate-in-2026-sources-say/">CBS News is reporting</a> that Republican senator <strong>Joni Ernst</strong> of <strong>Iowa</strong> plans to reveal next week that she won’t seek reelection in 2026.</p> 
  <p>Ernst, 55, who has served in the Senate since 2015, plans to make the announcement on Thursday, CBS reported citing multiple sources familiar with the matter.</p> 
  <p>Per CBS’s report:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Some Iowa Democrats have already jumped into the race, including state Sen. Zach Wahls, state Rep. Josh Turek, and Des Moines School Board chairwoman Jackie Norris.</p> 
   <p>Ernst has been evasive about whether she would run for a third term in 2026, but in public remarks earlier this month, predicted continued GOP control of Iowa.</p> 
   <p>“Every day we get a new Democratic member of the House or Senate that decides to run for this Senate seat — bring it on,” she said at a meeting of the Westside Conservative Club. “Bring it on, folks. Because I tell you, at the end of the day, Iowa is going to be red.”</p> 
   <p>White House officials had hoped Ernst would run again, instead of joining other Republicans who are leaving the Senate, including North Carolina’s <strong>Thom Tillis</strong>, Alabama’s <strong>Tommy Tuberville</strong> and Kentucky’s <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong>.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Doctors at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) would be <strong>barred from performing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion">abortions</a>, even in cases of rape and incest</strong>, under new <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/04/2025-14687/reproductive-health-services">rules proposed</a> by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>.</p> 
  <p>The draft regulations, which also forbid providers from counseling female veterans about terminating a pregnancy, have generated <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docket/VA-2025-VHA-0073">nearly 20,000 comments</a> in the federal register from conservative activists, abortion rights supporters and female veterans, many of them survivors of sexual assault.</p> 
  <p>“I am a veteran, a mother, and my abortion saved my life,” <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/VA-2025-VHA-0073-10046">wrote</a> Mary Dodson-Otten, a 41-year-old nurse and air force veteran who lives outside Atlanta, Georgia.</p> 
  <p>Dodson-Otten told the Guardian she ended a pregnancy in her 20s after she got pregnant by an abusive boyfriend who was a fellow service member. Without the abortion, she said, <strong>“I don’t think I would have survived, whether it would have been him hurting me or me hurting me.”</strong></p> 
  <p>The rule proposed by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has an exception that allows abortions to take place “when a physician certifies that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term”. But abortion rights advocates said the exception was too limited.</p> 
  <p><strong>“Women are going to die,”</strong> predicted Caitlin Russell, a former US army captain who served two tours in Afghanistan and studies female veterans’ health at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

  <p>Lowell says that Judge Cobb would need to determine what constitutes as “cause” in this case.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Senate Democrats sign letter to postpone confirmation hearing for new Fed governor nominee</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>All Democrats on the Senate banking, housing, and urban affairs committee <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20Scott%20on%20Miran%20Hearing.pdf">have signed a letter</a> to Republican chair <strong>Tim Scott</strong>, the senator from South Carolina, <strong>to postpone Stephen Miran’s confirmation hearing</strong> to the Federal Reserve’s board of governors – scheduled for next week.</p> 
  <p>The lawmakers say that Donald Trump’s decision to fire Lisa Cook earlier this week is an “<strong>unprecedented attempt”</strong> to <strong>“undermine”</strong> the US central bank’s independence. <strong>Instead, the Democrats say the committee should “hold an oversight hearing on the legal and economic implications of the President’s actions</strong><strong>”.</strong></p> 
  <p>The added in the letter:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have a responsibility to the American public to ensure that the Federal Reserve is making decisions that are in the best interest of businesses and households, pursuant to its congressional mandate, not based on the whims of the President.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Important to note that <strong>Miran was announced as the president’s pick to replace Adriana Kugler</strong>, who resigned early from her post. If confirmed, Miran would fulfill the remainder of Kugler’s term, which expires at the end of January.</p> 
  <p>If Trump’s attempt to oust Cook from the Federal Reserve board is successful, that would create another vacancy for him to nominate a governor.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">DC restaurants take a hit as workers, terrified of Ice raids, stay home</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hernán was at the Latin American restaurant that he owns with his brother in north-west <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc">Washington DC</a> last week when <strong>his staff started getting phone calls and messages about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)</a> checkpoints in the neighborhood. The employees, scared that they might be targeted and racially profiled, asked if they could go home</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Within hours, Hernán had to close their doors, and the restaurant hasn’t been open since.</p> 
  <p>“Literally after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">President Trump</a> brought the national guard on DC, everything stopped,” said Hernán, who requested his last name not be used due to fears of Ice retaliation. “Everything disappeared because the bike delivery guys, they’re scared. They’re not on the streets right now. My people, most of my cooks are Spanish[-speaking] and they don’t want to go to DC right now.”</p> 
  <p>Hernán, who also owns a restaurant in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/maryland">Maryland</a>, said he was hoping to be able to reopen in a few weeks if and when the Trump administration’s takeover of the DC police ends and immigration enforcement arrests become less frequent. But the future is unclear for him and many restaurant owners in the US capital.</p> 
  <p>Already suffering from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-washington-dc-national-guard-restaurants">fewer customers</a> due to the administration’s almost three-week-long crackdown, restaurants are also having to contend with staff shortages because many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigrants</a>, both documented and undocumented, fear coming into DC and being on the streets, and some have been detained by Ice.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>A visit to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/taiwan">Taiwan</a> by two US senators has drawn criticism from China, which claims the island as its own and objects to any contact between officials of the two sides.</strong></p> 
  <p>The chair of the Senate armed services committee, Roger Wicker, and the Nebraska senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taipei on Friday for a series of high-level meetings with senior Taiwanese leaders to discuss US-Taiwan relations, regional security, trade and investment, according to the American Institute in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/taiwan">Taiwan</a>, Washington’s de facto embassy in lieu of formal diplomatic relations with the self-governing island democracy.</p> 
  <p>Upon arrival, Wicker said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A thriving democracy is never fully assured … and we’re here to talk to our friends and allies in Taiwan about what we’re doing to enhance worldwide peace.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Wicker told Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, during a meeting at the presidential office in Taipei that he and Fischer were visiting to get a better understanding of Taiwan’s needs and concerns.</p> 
  <p>“We come here from the United States bringing a message from the Congress of commitment, of long-term friendship and a determination that a free country like Taiwan absolutely has the right to remain free and preserve self-determination,” Wicker said.</p> 
  <p>“At a time of global unrest, it is extremely significant for us to be here,” Fischer added, noting that discussions would include “security, opportunities and progress for this part of the world”.</p>

  <p>The actions include marches and rallies in cities such as <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-labor-day-rally-march-workers-over-billionaires/">Chicago</a> and <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/aflcio/event/834688/">Los Angeles</a>, a Labor Day parade in <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/aflcio/event/793169/">New York City</a>, rallies in <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/aflcio/event/834949/">Palmer, Alaska</a>, <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/aflcio/event/831978/">Freeport, Maine</a>, and a planned protest at the state capitol in <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/aflcio/event/823900/">Honolulu</a>, Hawaii.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/protest">protests</a> are organized by the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, and <a href="https://maydaystrong.org/">dozens</a> of partner organizations, including Public Citizen, Indivisible, Democracy Forward, MoveOn and Patriotic Millionaires.</p>

  <p>Federal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration authorities</a> on Wednesday staged an operation on the scene of the Bear Gulch fire, a nearly 9,000-acre (3,600-hectare) blaze in the Olympic national forest, where they arrested two people who were part of a contract firefighting crew, the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/climate-lab/federal-agents-arrest-firefighters-working-on-wa-wildfire/">Seattle Times</a> first reported. The fire is the largest currently burning in the state.</p> 
  <p>Authorities made the firefighters line up to show ID, the Seattle Times reported. One firefighter told the newspaper that they were not permitted to say goodbye to their detained colleagues.</p> 
  <p>“I asked them if his [co-workers] can say goodbye to him because they’re family, and they’re just ripping them away,” the firefighter said to the Seattle Times, adding that the federal agent swore and told the firefighter to leave.</p>

  <p><strong>Meanwhile, the White House has requested that a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">US military</a> base on the outskirts of Chicago assist with immigration operations as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> plans a broader takeover of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democratic</a>-run “sanctuary cities”.</strong></p> 
  <p>On Thursday, the Naval Station Great Lakes (NSGL) confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security had reached out for assistance, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigration-military-base-4be8ec065a8749bafd326333a1f1c767">telling</a> the Associated Press that the DHS had requested “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations”.</p> 
  <p>An NSGL spokesperson told the outlet that no decisions have been made regarding the request and that the base has not yet received any official request to support a national guard deployment. The Guardian has reached out to the NSGL for comment.</p> 
  <p>In a statement to the Guardian, a DHS spokesperson said: “President Trump has been clear: we are going to make our streets and cities safe again. Across the country, DHS law enforcement are arresting and removing the worst of worst including gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and rapists that have terrorized American communities. Under secretary [Kristi] Noem, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and CBP [Customs and Border Protection] are working overtime to deliver on the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe again.”</p> 
  <p>The signal from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> comes just a few weeks after the president directed a federal takeover of Washington DC – deploying the national guard, taking over the police department, and ramping up immigration raids and deportations in the city.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to fight what he says is runaway crime.</strong></p> 
  <p>Yet data shows most violent crime in those places and around the country has declined in recent years.</p> 
  <p>Homicides through the first six months of 2025 were down significantly compared to the same period in 2024, continuing a post-pandemic trend across the US, AP reports.</p> 
  <p>Trump, who has already taken federal control of police in Washington, DC, has maligned the six Democratic-run cities that all are in states that opposed him in 2024. But he hasn’t threatened sending in the Guard to any major cities in Republican-leaning states.</p> 
  <p>John Roman, a data expert who directs the Center on Public Safety &amp; Justice at the University of Chicago, acknowledged violence in some urban neighborhoods has persisted for generations. But he said there’s no US city where there “is really a crisis.”</p> 
  <p>“We’re at a remarkable moment in crime in the United States,” he said.</p>

  <p>“We’re here to talk to our friends and allies in Taiwan about what we’re doing to enhance worldwide peace, the kind of peace through strength that Ronald Reagan talked about,” he told reporters at Taipei’s downtown Songshan airport, referring to the late US president.</p>

  <p><strong>Senior CDC vaccine research and public health leaders who resigned in protest told hundreds of supporters across the street from the campus on Thursday that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> needs to “get politics out of public health”.</strong></p> 
  <p>The agency is reeling from the firing of the CDC chief, Susan Monarez, but Monarez, who was confirmed as CDC chief just a month ago, has refused to be removed. Three senior leaders – Debra Houry, Demetre Daskalakis and Daniel Jernigan – resigned shortly after in protest, citing the alleged spread of misinformation under the Trump administration and political interference in their work. The staffers cheered and applauded them at the event on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>“You are the people that protect America, and America needs to see that you are the people that protect America, and we are going to be your loudest advocates,” said Daskalakis to the throng. Daskalakis, who was accompanied at the rally by Houry and Jernigan, is now the former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and is known for his leadership in HIV prevention and vaccination programs and the Biden administration’s response to the mpox outbreak.</p>

  <p>The three, plus Jennifer Leyden, who led the office of public health data, resigned together on Thursday to make a statement about the damage the administration had done to public vaccine research, and in protest of the administration’s response to vaccine disinformation, they said.</p> 
  <p>“We agreed to do this together. We’ve been talking about it for months, and the past few days, it was just escalating,” said Houry, the CDC’s former chief medical officer. “If one of us retired, it would have been a blip. When the three of us do it together, it’s more powerful and just shows the state of our agency.” She and the others are asking for Congress to intervene, to put a stop to political interference in the organization’s work.</p>

  <p>Lisa Cook <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/28/fed-governor-lisa-cook-sues-trump">sued the US president on Thursday</a>, with her lawyers describing his attempt to dismiss her as “unprecedented and illegal”, and based on “pretextual” allegations.</p> 
  <p>The case is widely expected to be ultimately decided by the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court"> supreme court. </a>While it makes it way through the courts, Cook is seeking a temporary restraining order against Trump’s attempt to “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/trump-fires-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook">immediately</a>” dismiss her from the Fed’s board.</p> 
  <p>A hearing on the motion is set for 10am in Washington on Friday. The case has been assigned to US district judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>.</p> 
  <p>Trump wrote to Cook on Monday, telling her that he was removing her from her position “effective immediately”, based on the allegation from one of his allies that she had obtained a mortgage on a second home she incorrectly described as her primary residence.</p> 
  <p>The president has spent months <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/trump-federal-reserve-lisa-cook-explained">attacking the Fed</a>, where most policymakers – including Cook – have so far defied his calls for interest rate cuts. He has spoken of rapidly building “a majority” on the central bank’s board, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight.</p>

  <p>A White House official confirmed to the Guardian that Jim O’Neill, currently the deputy secretary of the Department of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health">Health</a> and Human Services (HHS), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-chief-fired-white-house-monarez-trump">had been selected to temporarily lead the public health agency</a>, giving Kennedy an ally in his efforts to overhaul US vaccine policy.</p> 
  <p>Unlike Monarez, O’Neill, a former investment executive, does not have a medical or scientific background. He served as a former speechwriter for the health department during the George W Bush administration, and went on to work for the tech investor and conservative megadonor Peter Thiel.</p> 
  <p><strong>Senator Bill Cassidy</strong>, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, called on the department’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to indefinitely postpone its upcoming 18 September meeting.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Serious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership and lack of scientific process being followed for the now announced September ACIP meeting.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>senator Susan Collins</strong> said she was “alarmed” by Monarez’s firing, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Susan Monarez is a highly capable scientist who brought a wealth of experience to the agency. While I recognize that the CDC director serves at the pleasure of the president, I am alarmed that she has been fired after only three weeks on the job.</p> 
   <p>Last night I talked with former director Monarez about her removal. I agree with chairman Bill Cassidy, who heads the Senate committee with jurisdiction over the CDC, that this matter warrants congressional oversight.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>It came as senior CDC vaccine research and public health leaders who resigned in protest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-rally-staffers-protest">told hundreds of supporters across the street from the campus</a> on Thursday that the Trump administration needs to “get politics out of public health”.</p> 
  <p>In other developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The president is gravely serious about running for a third term in violation of the US constitution, California governor Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday, warning Americans to “wake up” to what he described as Trump’s flagrant disregard for democratic norms.</strong> “I don’t think Donald Trump wants another election,” Newsom, a Democrat, said during a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=POLITICO%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%9CThe+California+Agenda%3A+Sacramento+Summit+youtube&amp;oq=POLITICO%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%9CThe+California+Agenda%3A+Sacramento+Summit+youtube&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE1NjBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:47680b02,vid:FvYD2QDWE8k,st:0">live interview</a> at a summit hosted by Politico in Sacramento. “This guy doesn’t believe in free, fair elections.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The White House has requested that a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">US military</a> base on the outskirts of Chicago assist with immigration operations as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> plans a broader takeover of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democratic</a>-run “sanctuary cities”.</strong> On Thursday, the Naval Station Great Lakes confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had reached out for assistance, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigration-military-base-4be8ec065a8749bafd326333a1f1c767">telling</a> the Associated Press that the DHS had requested “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure and other logistical needs to support DHS operations”.</p></li>

   <li><p><strong>The family of 18-year-old Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz was shocked when they found out that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) had discreetly moved him out of California,</strong> according to California congresswoman Luz Rivas, who spoke with his relatives and reviewed federal detention records.</p></li>
