social security debt from an abusive partner, following a change to the rules that will allow some of those debts to be waived.</p> <p>The changes, announced this morning, are part of a push to protect those affected by family violence and coercive control from financial abuse by a partner.</p> <p><strong>Services Australia</strong> will now have the power to waive social security debts incurred as a result of family violence, but will also be able to consider circumstances including mental capacity, the impact of natural disasters and homelessness.</p> <p>The social services minister, <strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong>, said the social services system should “be a part of the solution, not part of the problem” for victim-survivors of family violence. She said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Every victim survivor who relies on our social security system should feel like they can trust that the system will keep them safe. It should be part of the solution, not part of the problem …</p> <p>This is an important first step toward our landmark election commitment to stop perpetrators using Commonwealth systems to abuse their partners.</p> </blockquote>    <p>Economic Justice Australia has “wholeheartedly welcomed” the change and says it will help victim survivors of family violence access justice, and leave abusive circumstances. Its chief executive, <strong>Kate Allingham,</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>People have had their measly social security payments further reduced to repay these debts, taking food off the table and adding significant financial pressure on families …</p> <p>This change to the legislation is a no-brainer, and will result in a much fairer outcome for people in incredibly vulnerable and distressing situations.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-31T03:44:14.893Z">at 4.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68b3beaa8f08d02733f206b9" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/stephanie-convery"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-31T03:17:29.326Z">4.17am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Melbourne: bottles thrown as opposing protests cross paths</strong></p> <p>The anti-immigration march and the counter demonstration have just met at the corner of Collins St and Elizabeth St. There’s a barrier of police between them, three rows deep, including police on horseback, but that hasn’t stopped verbal confrontation. </p> <p>Someone has just thrown a bottle into the front line of the antifascist counter-rally – it smashed at their feet – and a can of beer has just gone flying over the police line towards the anti-immigration march.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-31T03:22:50.888Z">at 4.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68b3b9878f08e752a46e8e1c" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-31T03:12:37.653Z">4.12am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Malcolm Roberts and Pauline Hanson address Canberra anti-immigration rally</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>AAP have pictures of the One Nation leader, <strong>Pauline Hanson,</strong> and senator <strong>Malcolm Roberts</strong> at the anti-mass immigration rally being held in Canberra:</p>     </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-31T03:36:31.662Z">at 4.36am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68b3bb768f08e752a46e8e2a" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/josh-butler"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-31T03:09:22.442Z">4.09am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Canberra: anti-immigration protesters and counter-protest cause traffic delays</strong></p> <p>A crowd of what appears to be a few hundred has gathered and chanted at Canberra’s anti-immigration rally, on the edge of Lake Burley Griffin.
