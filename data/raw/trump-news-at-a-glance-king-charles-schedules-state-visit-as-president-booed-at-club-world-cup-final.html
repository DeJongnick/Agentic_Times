<p>King Charles has invited <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> for an unprecedented second state visit in September, scheduling the trip for three days when parliament is not sitting and removing the possibility of the US president addressing parliament.</p> <p>The visit is a coup for the White House, with Trump becoming the first elected politician in modern history to be granted two state visits, after his earlier one in 2019.</p> <p>But the US president received a frostier reception when he made an appearance at the Club World Cup final in New Jersey on Sunday.</p> <p>Trump was booed and jeered by the crowd during the national anthem before the match and again while presenting the trophy to Chelsea alongside Fifa president Gianni Infantino.</p> <p>Here are the key <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics">US politics</a> stories at a glance:</p>  <h2>King Charles schedules Trump state visit for when parliament in recess</h2>  <p>Buckingham Palace announced on Monday that Donald Trump would come to the UK from 17-19 September, soon after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons">House of Commons</a> rises for its traditional break for the annual party conferences.</p> <p>King Charles will host Trump and his wife, Melania, at Windsor Castle, though the palace has not yet set out any other details of the trip. The dates of the trip, however, avoid the prospect of the US president making an address to parliament.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/king-charles-schedules-trump-state-visit-for-when-uk-parliament-is-in-recess"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump booed but unbowed at Club World Cup final</h2>  <p>The US president was front and center for Chelsea’s trophy lift and was greeted by widespread boos at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/worldclubchampionship">Club World Cup</a> final at a sold-out MetLife Stadium on Sunday.</p> <p>Trump and Fifa president Gianni Infantino jointly carried the trophy to the Chelsea team on the stage after their 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain.
