<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-01-18T15:00:28Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Naomi Alderman &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Books</div>
<p>Born in London in 1974, the author Naomi Alderman studied PPE at Oxford and creative writing at the University of East Anglia. She published her award-winning first novel, <em>Disobedience</em>, in 2006, which was later adapted into a film starring Rachel McAdams and Rachel Weisz. Named one of Granta’s best young British novelists in 2013, Alderman has published five further books, including the Women’s prize-winning<em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/13/the-power-naomi-alderman-review-shocking-satire-gender-war">The Power</a></em> (2016), which was adapted for television by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Power-Season-1/dp/B0B8NX94TY">Prime Video</a> in 2023. Her new Radio 4 show, <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0026njq">Human Intelligence</a></em>, explores great thinkers, including <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0026ppb">Malcolm X</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0026pnw">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, in 50 15-minute episodes.</p>    <h2><strong>1. </strong><strong>Book</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://anthonyhorowitz.com/books/list/series/hawthorne-horowitz">The Hawthorne and Horowitz books</a> by Anthony Horowitz</strong></p> <p>I’ve just finished a novel that is a science fiction story and also narrated by me, as myself. My brilliant American editor, Asya, recommended these books, where Anthony Horowitz does the same thing but in a detective series, placing himself as the Watson to the irascible but brilliant Hawthorne. The books are opinionated, funny and delicious about the lives and humiliations of authors. Horowitz is a master of the serial format, and clearly has a long mystery to unfold about Hawthorne. I’m longing for the next one… I start to think that Hawthorne probably didn’t pick Horowitz as a partner by chance.</p> <h2><strong>2. </strong><strong>Movie</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/03/anora-review-sean-baker-screwball-cinderella-tale-vaults-him-towards-greatness-mikey-madison">Anora</a></strong><strong>, dir Sean Baker</strong></p>    <p>This is about sex work; if you can’t stomach seeing nearly naked young women giving lap dances to middle-aged men, absolutely don’t put yourself through it. However. The movie could have been grim or sanitised and it’s neither. It picks up where <em>Pretty Woman</em> left off. A sex worker gets paid for a “girlfriend experience” week by the son of a Russian oligarch. And then he proposes. And his family aren’t happy. The whole thing is made glorious by the way Anora is written – she always has an intense belief in her own intrinsic value – and by Mikey Madison’s explosive, electric performance.</p> <h2><strong>3. </strong><strong>Game</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/nov/14/rise-of-the-golden-idol-review-a-gruesome-bizarre-and-brilliant-1970s-detective-game">The Rise of the Golden Idol</a></strong></p>    <p>The second in the series, but stand-alone, this game is just tremendous. A mystery game that actually works well and has a good story, where each puzzle is different and satisfying. You investigate each illustration of a crime scene to work out what’s happened. There’s a mysterious Golden Idol with magical powers, of course, and people who have killed to possess it. You can get it <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/231423314113124">free on your phone if you have a Netflix</a> account. Pure enjoyment.</p> <h2><strong>4. </strong><strong>Theatre</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/06/the-week-in-theatre-giant-roots-look-back-in-anger-review">Giant</a></strong></p>    <p>I saw this play about Roald Dahl and his antisemitism at the Royal Court – where new artistic director David Byrne is doing remarkable work – and it is making <a href="https://gianttheplay.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAs5i8BhDmARIsAGE4xHw97kE1L1UmJK1u3vZIcGKn8DdNTRyMYl9-fye3nRtyphCQlfIicOwaAoVlEALw_wcB">a West End transfer</a>. It is, straightforwardly, what theatre can do that no other medium can. Four people – five including the housekeeper who has the best line of the play – shouting at one another about ideas. Dahl has just written an antisemitic newspaper piece – or is it “just” anti-Israel? Where is the line? When must a writer speak? Can one love someone’s work and hate their views? It provides no simplistic answers. John Lithgow is extraordinary. God it’s fantastic.</p>    <h2><strong>5. Learning</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/choose/the-open-university?ps_kw=open%20university%20uk&amp;cid=sem-9237400975&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAs5i8BhDmARIsAGE4xHwvUIQvkdZk9U_eLUhMxujAvvg5bXx-OUcoj8nTUGIadrYxknx1_BEaAjuLEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">The </a></strong><strong><a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/choose/the-open-university?ps_kw=open%20university%20uk&amp;cid=sem-9237400975&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAs5i8BhDmARIsAGE4xHwvUIQvkdZk9U_eLUhMxujAvvg5bXx-OUcoj8nTUGIadrYxknx1_BEaAjuLEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Open University</a></strong></p> <p>The OU is one of the treasures of this country. I’ve been studying various things with them for more than a decade now; it’s part of the rhythm of my life. I’m halfway through a masters in classics, sneaking away from my “proper work” to read Demosthenes or get to grips with Antigone. Fundamentally, this is the person I always wanted to be. That’s what the Open University is for – for everyone. If you think you may like it, this is your signal to go and register for a course. Just a module to start. Go on.</p> <h2><strong>6. Substack</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://georgesaunders.substack.com/">Story Club with George Saunders</a></strong></p>    <p>I loved Saunders’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/06/a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain-by-george-saunders-review-rules-for-good-writing-and-more">A Swim in </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/06/a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain-by-george-saunders-review-rules-for-good-writing-and-more">a Pond in the Rain</a></em>, his analysis of great Russian short stories, from a class he teaches. He does the same thing now in a Substack, where engaged people who love literature read a story together every month and then really <em>get into it</em>. Anything from James Joyce to Gertrude Stein to Dickens to Chekhov. It’s my best social media, and very much continuing professional development for a novelist.</p>
