<p>The Pixel 10 Pro is Google’s best phone that is still a pocketable, easy-to-handle size, taking the excellent Pixel 10 and beefing it up in the camera department.</p> <p>That makes it a contender for the top smaller phone with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro, offering the best of Google’s hardware without an enormous screen. It is also the cheapest of three Pixel 10 Pro phones starting at £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699) sitting below the bigger 10 Pro XL and the tablet-phone hybrid the 10 Pro Fold.</p> <p>The 10 Pro looks almost identical to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/02/pixel-9-pro-review-small-phone-camera-google-android-ai">last year’s version</a> and has the same size 6.3in OLED screen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone">as the Pixel 10</a> but slightly brighter, slicker and crisper. It is one of the best displays on a phone, while the polished aluminium sides and mat glass back look expensive even if the colour choice is rather staid compared with its cheaper sibling.</p>    <p>The 10 Pro is one of the first phones to come with Qi2 wireless charging built into the back, which offers compatibility with a range of magnetic accessories, including those made for Apple’s MagSafe.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone">Google Pixel 10 review: the new benchmark for a standard flagship phone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inside is Google’s latest Tensor G5 chip, which is about 35% faster than last year’s model but falls short of the best-in-class performance of Qualcomm’s top Android chip <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/17/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-still-the-superphone-to-beat">used in rivals</a>. Day to day the 10 Pro feels rapid, and it handled games just fine, though there are better options for those who want the absolute best graphics and frame rates.</p> <p>The Pixel has solid battery life, managing up to about two days between charges with about seven hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi. Most people will need to charge it every other day, but on heavy use days out and about in London on 5G it still managed to reach midnight with at least 25% left.</p>    <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> 6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> Google Tensor G5</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 16</p></li> <li><p><strong>Camera:</strong> 50MP + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x tele; 42MP selfie</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 5G, nano + e-sim (US: e-sim-only), wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSS</p></li> <li><p><strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 207g</p></li> </ul> <h2>Android 16 with AI everywhere</h2>    <p>The phone ships with Android 16 installed, with security and software updates <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705">until August 2032</a>, ensuring it stays up to date for the life of the phone. It is the same software as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone">regular Pixel 10</a> with a bold, colourful and fun design.</p> <p>Google has shoved AI in almost every corner of the phone, most of it powered by the latest local Gemini Nano models, which means your data doesn’t have to leave your device to be processed, preserving privacy.</p> <p>The advanced <a href="https://store.google.com/intl/en_uk/ideas/gemini-ai-assistant/">Gemini chatbot</a> is capable of interacting with your apps, seeing what is on your screen or through your camera, and having live back-and forth-conversations via voice.</p>    <p>But the standout new feature is <a href="https://store.google.com/intl/en_uk/ideas/articles/magic-cue/">Magic Cue</a>, which runs in the background and combines information from your Google account with data on your phone to offer help or quick suggestions in a number of Google apps. For instance, when you ring a business, Magic Cue pops up a card directly in the phone app showing your emails with your order confirmation details for one-tap access when you need them.</p> <p>Magic Cue works locally with about 10 days’ worth of data so it is not keeping a permanent log of everything you do, but has been genuinely useful in testing. It only works in Google’s and a select number of third-party apps, such as eBay, but not WhatsApp, so its utility is limited if you don’t use the right apps.</p> <p>The 10 Pro also comes with a year’s subscription to <a href="https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/16476811">Google AI Pro</a>, which usually costs £19 a month, and provides access to the more powerful Gemini Pro, image and video-generating models, plus 2TB of cloud storage for Google Drive, Photos and Gmail.</p> <h2>Camera</h2>    <p>The 10 Pro has some of the most powerful cameras on a smartphone with a 42-megapixel selfie, 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide and 48MP 5x telephoto camera capable of an optical zoom quality up to 10x. But it is also the first to feature generative AI image processing directly in the camera, which is impressive but calls into question what a photo really is.</p> <p>The main camera is one of the best in the business, effortlessly capturing great photos that are rich in detail across a range of lighting conditions. The ultrawide camera is also very good for landscapes and group shots, and is used for the great macrophotography mode for fun closeups. The 5x telephoto is one of the very best on a phone and can shoot photos at 10x, which remain good quality, particularly in bright conditions.</p> <p>Google excels in difficult lighting conditions such as very bright or contrasting scenes, while in dark environments its night sight produces sharper images with more accurate colours than rivals. The Pixel’s portrait mode is greatly improved this year, too.</p>    <p>Zoom beyond 30x up to 100x and the phone uses a local genAI model to put back into the photo the detail and sharpness lost from digital zoom. Generally it works well but not flawlessly. It can get the perspective wrong or superimposes the wrong details, creating images that are clearly made by AI. But shoot predictable subjects such as buildings, cars or trees, and it firms up the digitally stretched details making the 100x zoom surprisingly usable.</p> <p>When it detects a person it does not even attempt to use the genAI model, which is probably for the best, and like all genAI systems it can struggle with words, often producing something that looks like an alien script.</p> <p>The camera app adds <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/">C2PA content credentials</a> to all photos that records how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved, including for the new zoom and popular Add Me feature from last year. Best Take has been made automatic, allowing the camera to capture multiple images when you press the shutter button to try to get one where everyone’s looking at the camera.</p> <p>The 10 Pro also has the same new AI Camera Coach feature as the regular 10, which teaches you how to get a better shot by analysing the scene through the camera and giving you options for different angles and framing.</p> <p>The camera also has plenty of fun photography and video modes, shoots great films as well as photo, and cements the 10 Pro as one of the very best on the market.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2>    <p>The battery <a href="https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/screen/product/smartphonestablets20231669/2347995">will last in excess</a> of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repair, <a href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14725410">with manuals</a> and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/en-gb/Parts/Google_Phone">parts available</a>.</p> <p>The Pixel 10 Pro contains 30% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin. The company breaks down the <a href="https://sustainability.google/reports/google-pixel-10-pro-product-environmental-report/">phone’s environmental impact</a> in its report and will <a href="https://store.google.com/gb/magazine/recycling">recycle old devices</a> for free.</p> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro costs from <a href="https://store.google.com/gb/product/pixel_10_pro">£999</a> (€1,099/<a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_10_pro">$999</a>/<a href="https://store.google.com/au/product/pixel_10_pro">A$1,699</a>) in a choice of four colours.</p> <p>For comparison, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone">Pixel 10</a> starts at <a href="https://store.google.com/gb/product/pixel_10">£799</a>, the Pixel 10 Pro XL at <a href="https://store.google.com/gb/config/pixel_10_pro">£1,199</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/15/pixel-9a-review-google-cut-price-android-winner">Pixel 9a</a> costs <a href="https://store.google.com/gb/product/pixel_9a">£399</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/21/samsung-galaxy-s25-review-smallest-top-tier-android-ai">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> costs <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s25/buy/">£799</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/17/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-still-the-superphone-to-beat">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> costs <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/">£1,249</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/08/iphone-16-pro-review-apple-levels-up-its-smaller-pro-phone-screen-camera-zoom">iPhone 16 Pro</a> costs <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16-pro">£999</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Pixel 10 Pro doesn’t reinvent the wheel or set a new bar in quite the same way as the base-model <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone">Pixel 10 managed this year</a>. But it still upgrades its already market-leading camera and AI features.</p> <p>It is snappy in operation, has decent battery life and still looks good, though hardcore gamers may want to look elsewhere for more powerful graphics. Google’s take on Android is one of the best and comes with long-term support so you can keep using it for years.</p> <p>Gemini’s various new tools are generally useful and less gimmicky than many. Magic Cue has great potential to be a time-saver without getting in the way, but needs to be expanded to more apps.</p> <p>Injecting genAI directly into the camera app improves its extended zoom images, but further blurs the line between what is and isn’t a photo – a philosophical debate most will probably gloss over because the tool is useful and avoids doing anything outlandish.</p> <p>The Pixel 10 Pro is easily one of the best smaller phones available and really hammers home just how much more advanced Google’s AI tools are than Apple’s and other rivals.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, solid battery life, great screen and size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> quite expensive, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical sim card slot in the US, not a big upgrade from the standard Pixel 10.</p> </blockquote>
