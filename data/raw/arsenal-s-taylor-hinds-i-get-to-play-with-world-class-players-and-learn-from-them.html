<p>If you had told Taylor Hinds a year ago that she would be back at the club she joined at the age of 10, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/24/arsenal-grab-womens-champions-league-final-glory-against-barcelona">reigning European champions, Arsenal</a>, and would have received her first senior England call-up and cap, she probably would have laughed.</p> <p>“I wouldn’t have believed it,” the summer signing from Liverpool says with a bemused grin, ready to face the Women’s Super League champions, Chelsea, on Saturday. “I’ve had so many full-circle moments since I’ve been back and it’s been a lot to take in. It’s been positive and I’m just so proud of myself for making these changes. It’s just been a mad couple of months but the best couple of months and I just feel like I can really push on now and go somewhere new as a player and that’s what I want to do. I want to get all the experiences I can in these environments and really push myself to the max.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/28/england-australia-friendly-international-match-report">Agyemang injury for England deflates Bronze’s birthday celebrations against Matildas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sitting on a sofa in the main canteen at Arsenal’s London Colney training ground, the 26-year-old left-back speaks with the energy of someone appreciative of a twist in a tale she maybe thought would not come.</p> <p>When the nearby door swings open, Clare Wheatley walks in and Arsenal’s director of women’s football makes a beeline for Hinds, who she hasn’t seen since the defender’s England adventures last month. “Enjoy it,” a beaming Wheatley says. “I’m so pleased for you, Taylor, what a story, you couldn’t write it.”</p> <p>Hinds has slotted in well at Arsenal, featuring seven times, many of her appearances from the bench, and the reward has been her England call-up. Her inclusion in Sarina Wiegman’s squad for friendlies against Brazil and Australia was a surprise to many. Hinds opted to represent Jamaica last year, featuring in a friendly against France seven years after she played her final game for England’s Under-19s.</p> <p>The call-up was “unexpected,” says Hinds, who also played for England’s Under-17s. “I have dual heritage, which I’m obviously really proud of, but growing up going through the England pathway meant that something I’d always dreamed of was to play for England. I have nothing but respect for Jamaica, the country is still a big part of who I am and a part of my family and my identity. My family were very proud of me representing Jamaica but they were also very proud of me getting my England call-up and making my debut.”</p>    <p>Wiegman gave Hinds time to mull over a tough decision. For many it will be hard to understand how difficult it must be to choose between two integral parts of yourself in this way.</p> <p>“I had a great conversation with Sarina and she allowed me time and space to think about the decision because she knows that I have love and pride for both countries,” Hinds says. “That’s what people don’t realise, that I am proud of both countries. Hopefully everyone can respect what is a hugely personal decision … [Wiegman] understood my situation and she respected it fully.”</p> <p>Hinds was on the bench against Brazil but started the 3-0 defeat of Australia and impressed. How has she found her experiences with Wiegman and Arsenal’s head coach, Renée Slegers?</p> <p>“There’s a few similarities there,” she says. “They’re quite honest and direct and I’ve always loved that, having that honest relationship with a manager. There were new [England] staff in too but they were new for everyone in the team as well, and it was great because we got to spend some time getting to know them a bit off the pitch.”</p> <p>Hinds was playing 90 minutes every week for Liverpool, so battling for a place at Arsenal has presented a challenge. “This is the type of team that I want to be in,” she says. “I have the utmost respect for Liverpool for everything they’ve done for me over the five years. There’s a little part of me that’s always going to love Liverpool. So many of my friends are still up there, scousers are just one of a kind too, and I definitely miss that side of it, the people, but I’m also loving it here and I’m really thriving and happy.</p> <p>“The difference is just the standard, the intensity and the quality. Everything’s so fast-paced and training every day is like playing in a game every day. That’s what you want: you want to train how you play and here I get to do that with world-class players and learn from them.”</p> <p>Off the pitch, she says she knows the “one club” mantra is a bit of a cliche but “it’s really like that here, it’s family vibes”.</p> <p>Hinds, who aspired to be like Rachel Yankey, one of several Black players in Arsenal’s senior squad when she was in the academy, recently featured in some of the club’s content around Black History Month alongside Noni Madueke, including discussing the book Black Arsenal with the co-editor Dr Clive Nwonka. Embracing the inspiration she can be to young Black girls is hugely important to her.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/04/emily-fox-on-a-year-of-uswnt-changes-and-ambitions-at-arsenal">‘There’s this buzz of excitement’: Emily Fox on USWNT and Arsenal ambitions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It’s only in the past few years that I really realised the role I can play, for young Black girls especially. Everyone inspires people in their own way. I may just inspire within the football community or the Black football community, and that’s fine. As long as I’m visible and I’m able to inspire even one person that’s enough and can go a long way.”</p> <p>She is encouraged by the number of Black fans in the stands at the Emirates for women’s games, including families. A crowd of more than 55,000 is expected on Saturday at a must-win game for Arsenal, who are fifth, five points behind Chelsea, the leaders.</p> <p>“We’ve not had the start we wanted in the WSL, which has obviously been frustrating, but the game against Leicester at the weekend [a 4-1 win] has given us some good momentum,” Hinds says. “Of course it’s going to be a tough game and a battle. Everyone lives for a derby – these games are exactly why we play football. We have respect for Chelsea but we also want to beat them.”</p>
