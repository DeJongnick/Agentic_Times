<p>Since the beginning of this school year, there have been at least two school shootings in Oakland, California.</p> <p>A shooting at the end of August in Madison Park academy in East Oakland, allegedly committed by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/30/oakland-school-shooting-12-year-old-california">12-year-old student</a>, left one classmate injured. Another, at Rudsdale Newcomer high school in East Oakland, left <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/28/california-high-school-shooting-oakland">six wounded</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/30/us-murder-rate-increase-firearms">Newly purchased firearms may play a role in US murder surge, data suggests | Jeff Asher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These shootings are part of a<strong> </strong>broader pattern of community gun violence in Oakland, a dynamic that has ripple effects throughout families, neighborhoods and communities.</p> <p>The daily toll of gun violence is why some Oakland teachers are adopting an innovative and multi-disciplinary gun violence curriculum. The program, which will be used in at least two Oakland schools this year, includes learning about the history of the second amendment, surveying gun violence victims in their own neighborhoods and writing opinion pieces that draw on policy and data analysis.</p> <p>The curriculum was developed following the shooting death of 17-year-old Jacob Gonzalez in Oakland <a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2013/10/30/police-identify-17-year-old-fatally-shot-monday-in-east-oakland/">in 2013</a>. His former middle school teachers, Athena Larios and Melanie Swandby at Lighthouse Community charter school – which is about two miles from Madison Park academy, where one school shooting occurred this year – were shaken by the loss and wanted to be more proactive in addressing gun violence with their students.</p> <p>“We do have a problem, so what do we do about it?” Larios recalled thinking at the time.</p> <p>In their expeditionary learning school, where students delve into a topic in-depth for months at a time, the teachers wanted to incorporate a curriculum that the students could relate to. The students voted on what they would study and the majority chose to learn more about gun violence.</p>    <p>“Guns and gun violence impact more young students than we’ll ever know,” said Shuna Lewis, a resource and education specialist at the school. Lewis lost her first husband when he was shot and killed by young men during an attempted robbery in 2008.</p> <p>In social studies, students learned about the second amendment and the history of guns in the US, while in math, they looked at statistics using information they gathered through a survey of their neighbors and other community members. They used their findings to calculate rates of gun violence and then visualized where violence was most prevalent by making a wooden map of Oakland with circuits and LED lights to mark where shootings occurred, according to Swandby.</p> <p>The students also wrote op-eds about solutions to gun violence, citing policy ideas and statistics they gathered. Guest speakers, including victims of gun violence, city officials and violence prevention specialists were invited to address the entire school.</p> <p>The teachers created the curriculum in partnership with <a href="https://www.visionquilt.org">Vision Quilt</a>, a national non-profit based in Portland that uses art and dialogue to address gun violence and to heal from violence. Their signature art project is using a 18in by 24in canvas, loosely based on the idea of the Aids quilt, where members of the public can create art and display them publicly.</p> <p>“I couldn’t stand for one more kid to be shot,” said Cathy DeForest, executive director of Vision Quilt, who visited Oakland to help with the implementation of the curriculum. “We believe that gun violence is a solvable problem. We just have to have the will.”</p> <p>The educators piloted the curriculum in 2016, and continued it for four years.</p>    <p>During the pandemic, as gun sales <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/31/us-gun-sales-rise-pandemic">surged</a>, the teachers shifted gears and created an in-depth <a href="https://www.visionquilt.org/toolkit.html">digital toolkit</a> in partnership with Vision Quilt so that schools across the US <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCK1IB_Vrg8cUydaIuWFp_JLLb1_j8VfNZguy0vGOiBVIvxQ/viewform">could adopt</a> the curriculum. The toolkit includes case studies, lesson plans for math and history, and strategies for addressing the social-emotional needs of children.</p> <p>One of the considerations and challenges in building the curriculum was how to not retraumatize the students who were exposed to gun violence at an early age, the educators said.</p> <p>“How are we going to do this in a way that’s not harming them any more than gun violence already does, in a responsible way and really serving their emotional needs?” Larios said. So the teachers said they focused instead on empowering students.</p> <p>The school ensured that onsite counselors were ready to speak with students and families if needed, and gave families warning of what topics were about to come up.</p> <p>The teachers also said they wanted to avoid telling the students what to think, so they could draw their own conclusions based on their research and learning. For instance, some students are fascinated with guns, Swandby said, including Gonzalez, whose 2013 killing inspired the curriculum. He used to draw guns in class, she said, so the teachers recognize that the most vulnerable students are sometimes the ones who are most interested in them.</p> <p>While the teachers acknowledge that their three-month curriculum isn’t possible for all teachers and schools, they’re hopeful that it can be adapted to different educational settings, with consideration for students’ emotional needs. Several schools across the US have expressed interest in adopting it next semester.</p> <p>The curriculum is “portable and powerful”, DeForest said. “Instead of arming teachers, we’re trying to arm students and teachers with education. We’re trying to win over people’s hearts and minds, and young people can do that.”</p>    <p>At Lighthouse, the three month-long curriculum culminates in an exhibition of the student-made quilts – panels they painted or drew on, often with messages – in downtown Oakland that hundreds of parents and community members are invited to. The colorful banners address not only gun violence but related issues like police brutality, cyberbullying, resilience and race.</p> <p>In previous years, about <a href="https://www.visionquilt.org/lighthouse-community-charter-school.html">70 pieces</a> of quilt panels, many from Lighthouse but also others from across the country, were displayed inside Oakland City Hall after the exhibition event.<strong> </strong>Now, more than 200 of <a href="https://www.visionquilt.org/">these images</a> are publicly displayed along a mile-and-a-half stretch of International Boulevard in East Oakland, which has seen much of the city’s gun violence, where they’ll hang another four years.</p> <p>Larios and Swandby, who have both since left Lighthouse to teach elsewhere in Oakland, said their curriculum is a “humble offering” and hoped that it was a starting point for young people to discuss the impacts of gun violence.</p> <p>DeForest, of Vision Quilt, said that after completing the course, 88% of students said they had an increased knowledge about gun violence and the causes of gun violence, according to an internal survey, and 91% said they intended to prevent gun violence in their community, family or school.</p> <p>Lewis, the special education teacher, said the curriculum is powerful because of the students’ deep engagement in it. “They are involved in this very difficult yet necessary work that promotes positive change, because they know they can be changemakers,” she said.</p>    <p>Xitlalic Castro, who was in seventh grade when she participated in the curriculum and is now a senior, said the program helped her become a leader and run for student council. “I gained the knowledge that I have a voice, that everybody does,” she said. The curriculum also helped the school community become closer, since everyone was working together on the same topic, she added.</p> <p>Castro said it’s more important than ever for students and communities to start talking about gun violence.</p> <p>“As people of color in Oakland, it’s a real issue, it is a real problem,” she said. “It was reassuring to me that we have a voice and we were able to have somewhat of a change, even if it was spreading the message that it needed to stop. It’s very scary, it’s very emotional. This is why the curriculum can be so helpful, to spread the awareness of gun violence so hopefully this can come to an end. I’m hopeful.”</p>
