with their experiences of the heatwave.</strong></p> <p><strong>Nora</strong>, who lives in a flat in <strong>Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda</strong> in southern France, was without air conditioning as <strong>temperatures climbed to 42C over the weekend.</strong></p> <p>“It’s common not to have air conditioning in the region,” she says.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“The heat was so bad this past weekend we were worried about our dog, <strong>Pearl</strong>.</em></p> <p><em>As a precaution, we drove about an hour away to rent a pet-friendly hotel room for the weekend – just to sleep in the air conditioning and get out of the heat. <strong>The dog was thrilled.</strong>”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Nora has since returned to her apartment for the week, although the temperature is still 41C.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“We never have the lights on; <strong>we have the shutters partially closed. We have fans in front of it. We keep cold towels in our freezer</strong> and have those draped over us.</em></p> <p><em>It’s really just the poor dog – she doesn’t really want to eat. It’s just so hot for her, so we keep her in cooling baths.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>With the heat showing no signs of abating, <strong>she plans to find another hotel to stay in next weekend.</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><em>“We’ve made plans to do the same thing in a different city. We’re kind of combining hiding from the heat with some local travel and exploration.</em></p> <p><em>But <strong>it’s not sustainable to go to a hotel all the time</strong>. We’re fortunate that we can – I know that’s certainly not available to everybody.”</em></p> </blockquote>    <p>In Verdets in south-western France, <strong>Charlotte Blythe</strong>, 76, says <strong>the last two weeks have been “difficult”.</strong></p> <p>“We do any physical jobs such as gardening, housework, and dog walking before 10am at the latest,” she says.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“<strong>The house is put in the dark as we close the shutters or pull down the blinds.</strong> You are always thirsty, you have no appetite, as the heat builds, your energy diminishes. The fans are on for hours.</em></p> <p><em><strong>The worst time is at night.</strong> We sleep separately during this heat. Our dog <strong>Ruby</strong> is 12 and she’s a curly coated retriever, so she has a thick coat, and we just make sure that she’s got plenty of water. We let her lie in the shower.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Blythe has lived in the area for 20 years.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“I would say the first 10 years were fairly sort of constant in the summer – you knew what was coming.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Over the last 10 years, it’s accelerated.</strong> We bought a mobile air conditioning unit two years ago. This [heatwave] is demanding because it’s come quite early in the year, and we know that we’ve still got the height of the summer to come.”</em></p> </blockquote>    <p><strong>How are you being affected by the heatwave?</strong></p> <p>We would like to hear from people in the south of Europe who are experiencing high temperatures. How are you coping and what steps are you taking to deal with high temperatures?

However, <strong>such a system requires equal and symmetrical commitment from all neighboring countries.</strong></em></p> <p><em>Therefore, the temporary reinstatement of border controls on the Polish-German border is necessary to reduce, to the minimum, the uncontrolled flow of migrants crossing … the border.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Tusk added that “the task of the Border Guard is to <strong>… block any unjustified or unauthorized returns of migrants by the German side if they happened,</strong>” and “in order to gain control over this process, border checks must be reinstated.” “There is no other way,” he said.</p> <p>Tusk also <strong>pointedly warned Merz that if German government extends one-sided border controls in September</strong>, “contrary to the spirit of the Schengen Code and EU law,” <strong>Poland would retaliate</strong> with a similar move.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>The time when Poland would not respond appropriately to such actions has definitively come to an end.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The Polish PM added that <strong>the move to introduce temporary border controls with Lithuania was directly linked to the German policy change.</strong></p> <p>He argued that with the Polish-Belarusian heavily militarised border fully closed to irregular migration, other neighbouring countries, <strong>Latvia</strong> and <strong>Lithuania,</strong> are now being used to explore alternative routes for irregular migration, entering the Schengen area through the Baltics.</p> <p>As a result, he said, “the stream of illegal migration, orchestrated by Russia and Belarus, continues to flow through Belarus, Latvia, and Lithuania – and Poland, after all, has an open border with Lithuania.”</p> <p>Tusk also said he would <strong>work more closely with the Baltics to push the EU to act more decisively “to obstruct or prevent the operations orchestrated by Putin and Lukashenko</strong>, involving the organization of illegal migration and large-scale trafficking” into the EU in a bid to destabilise the bloc.</p> <p><strong>Merz</strong> was earlier asked about Poland’s growing criticism during a joint press conference with his Luxembourgish counterpart.</p> <p>Speaking just minutes before Tusk announced Poland’s decision, Merz said he was aware of Polish concerns and repeatedly spoke with the Polish prime minister in recent days, with interior ministers also holding “a long telephone conversation” last night.</p> <p>But he insisted that there were “no returns from Germany to Poland of asylum seekers who had already arrived in Germany.”</p> <p>Instead he appeared to suggest that <strong>Germany simply exercises its right to reject people at the border.</strong></p> <p>Merz also said <strong>the two countries “have a common problem that we want to solve together.”</strong></p> <p>The German chancellor also told the press conference that:</p> <blockquote> <p>“We naturally want to preserve the Schengen area, but <strong>freedom of movement in the Schengen area will only work in the long term if it is not abused by those who promote irregular migration</strong>, in particular by smuggling migrants.”</p> </blockquote>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-01T11:39:01.162Z">at 12.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div
