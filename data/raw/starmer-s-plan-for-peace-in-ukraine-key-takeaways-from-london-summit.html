<p>Europe is “at a crossroads in history”, said Keir Starmer as he hosted 18 leaders at a Lancaster House summit in London to discuss a new plan for peace in Ukraine.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/keir-starmer-europe-crossroads-history-must-support-ukraine">Keir Starmer says Europe ‘at crossroads in history’ and must support Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK, France and others will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, and discuss that plan with the US, “and take it forward together”, the prime minister said.</p> <p>Addressing the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was sitting alongside him, Starmer added: “I hope you know that we are all with you and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. Everyone around this table.”</p> <p>Among those in attendance were the French president, Emmanuel Macron; the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Canadian prime minster, Justin Trudeau; the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni; and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission.</p> <p>Here are some key takeaways:</p>  <h2>Ukraine must be put in strongest position for future negotiations</h2>  <p>Starmer added another £1.6bn in UK export finance for Ukraine to “buy more than 5,000 air defence missiles, which will be made in Belfast”, on top of the £2.2bn loan he had announced on Saturday</p> <p>This would be vital for protecting critical infrastructure now, and strengthen Ukraine in securing the peace, when it comes, he said.</p> <h2>There will be a ‘coalition of the willing’</h2>  <p>Any deal must be backed by strength so Russia cannot breach it, Starmer said.</p> <p>“Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can’t mean that we sit back,” the UK prime minister said.</p> <p>“The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air together with others, Europe must do the heavy lifting,” Starmer added.</p> <h2>The plan must have strong US backing</h2>  <p>While Europe would do the “heavy lifting”, backing from the US was needed. “We are working with the US on this point after my meeting with President Trump last week,” Starmer said.</p> <p>“We agree with the president on the urgent need for a durable peace, now we need to deliver together.”</p> <p>The US was not an “unreliable” ally, Starmer said when asked. It&nbsp;was a “strong and reliable ally” to the UK, adding that he had spoken with Trump on Saturday night.</p> <p>“The discussions we have had today, particularly on the coalition of the willing is on the basis that this is a plan that we will work on with the US. That is the purpose of the plan.”</p> <h2>Leaders agreed to keep military aid to Ukraine flowing</h2>  <p>Starmer said they agreed that any lasting peace must ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and security “and Ukraine must be at the table”.</p> <p>He added: “In the event of peace deal we will keep boosting Ukraine’s own defensive capabilities to deter any future invasions”.</p> <h2>Leaders will meet again very soon</h2>  <p>Starmer said: “We are at a crossroads in history today, this is not a moment for more talk, it’s time to act, time to step up and lead. And united around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.”</p> <h2>Nato chief says talks were ‘really positive’</h2>  <p>The Nato chief, Mark Rutte, said that “more European countries will ramp up defence spending” but did not go into specifics.</p> <p>He described increased defence spending as “very good news” and reiterated the need for “more of a fair balance” with the US.</p> <p>He told reporters the first step was to make sure there is a peace deal before there are discussions about how to guarantee it.</p>
