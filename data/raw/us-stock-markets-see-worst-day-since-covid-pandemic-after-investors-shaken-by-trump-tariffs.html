<p>US stock markets tumbled on Thursday as investors parsed the sweeping change in global trading following Donald Trump’s announcement of a barrage of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trump-new-tariffs-liberation-day">tariffs</a> on the country’s trading partners.</p> <p>All three major US stock markets closed down in their worst day since June 2020, during the Covid pandemic. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 6%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow dropped 4.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Apple and Nvidia, two of the US’s largest companies by market value, had lost a combined $470bn in value by midday.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/HFZ16/7/" data-alt="Graph"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/HFZ16/7/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the US dollar hit a six-month low, going down at least 2.2% on Thursday morning compared with other major currencies, and oil prices sank on fears of a global slowdown.</p> <p>Though the US stock market has been used to tumultuous mornings over the last few weeks, US stock futures – an indication of the market’s likely direction – had plummeted after the announcement. Hours later, Japan’s Nikkei index slumped to an eight-month low and was followed by falls in stock markets in London and across Europe.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/ACQRw/3/" data-alt="Graph"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/ACQRw/3/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The White House drafted up a list of countries, including some of its largest trade partners and ones <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/donald-trump-tariffs-antarctica-uninhabited-heard-mcdonald-islands">uninhabited</a> by humans, that will be receiving reciprocal tariffs. Many economies, including the EU, China, Japan and Taiwan, will see new tariffs above 20%.</p> <p>The 10% baseline tariff will go into effect on 5 April, while the reciprocal tariffs will begin on 9 April, according to the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/">White House</a>.</p> <p>“The markets are going to boom,” Trump told reporters at the White House as he left for Florida for the weekend. “I think it’s going very well.”</p> <p>Economists have for months <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/trumps-idiotic-and-flawed-tariff-calculations-stun-economists">warned</a> that high tariffs are a major risk to the US economy, pushing prices up for consumers on everything from cars to wine along with destabilizing the US’s role in the global economy.</p> <p>But that didn’t stop Trump from taking a celebratory tone at the event he dubbed “liberation day”. Trump tried to paint the tariffs as the start of “the golden age of America”.</p> <p>“We are going to start being smart and we’re going to start being very wealthy again,” Trump said.</p> <p>On Thursday, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, defended the move. “The president is not going to back off what he announced yesterday. He is not going to back off,” he told CNN.</p> <p>Multiple major American business groups have spoken out against the tariffs, including the Business Roundtable, a consortium of leaders of major US companies including JP Morgan, Apple and IBM, which called on the White House to “swiftly reach agreements” and remove the tariffs.</p> <p>“Universal tariffs ranging from 10-50% run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters,” the Business Roundtable said in a statement. “Damage to the US economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.”</p> <p>In a <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/more-tariffs-lead-to-higher-costs-for-american-families">statement</a>, the National Retail Federation, a lobbying group for the retail industry, said that the new tariffs negatively affect the business environment for retailers.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/trumps-idiotic-and-flawed-tariff-calculations-stun-economists">Trump’s ‘idiotic’ and flawed tariff calculations stun economists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“More tariffs equal more anxiety and uncertainty for American businesses and consumers. While leaders in Washington may not care about higher prices, hardworking American families do,” the group said.</p> <p>Contrary to what Trump has said about the jobs the tariffs will create, the National Association of Manufacturers <a href="https://nam.org/as-tariffs-hit-manufacturers-brace-for-impact-33695/?stream=series-press-releases">said</a> that tariffs actually “threaten investment, jobs, supply chains and, in turn, America’s ability to outcompete other nations and lead as the preeminent manufacturing superpower”.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--showcase" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/q1f8Z/1/" data-alt="US stock markets chart, indexed to the first day of each Presidency"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/q1f8Z/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The tariffs also appear unpopular among voters.

It’ll be something the whole world will be talking about.”</p>
