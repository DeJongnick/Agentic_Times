<p>South Korea’s intelligence agency has raised the national cyber threat level, amid concerns that hackers could take advantage of the chaos caused by a fire at a government datacentre that paralysed critical digital infrastructure across the country.</p> <p>The national cybersecurity centre, operating under the intelligence service, <a href="https://www.ncsc.go.kr/main/cop/bbs/selectBoardArticle.do?bbsId=CyberCrisis_main&amp;nttId=218020&amp;pageIndex=1">elevated the alert</a> from “attention” to “caution” on Monday, citing fears hackers could exploit vulnerabilities as recovery work continues.</p> <p>The fire broke out on Friday evening at the national information resources service in Daejeon, a major technology hub 140km (87 miles) south of Seoul. The facility is one of three operational government datacentres managing critical digital infrastructure across the country.</p> <p>Workers were relocating <a href="http://koreabizwire.com/old-lithium-battery-blamed-in-government-data-center-fire-raising-concerns-for-south-koreas-ess-market/334019">lithium-ion batteries</a> from a fifth-floor server room to the basement for replacement when one ignited, with the fire spreading to other batteries and adjacent servers. One worker sustained first-degree burns, and firefighters extinguished the fire after 22 hours.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/08/south-korea-google-maps-geographic-data-restrictions">South Korea postpones decision to let Google Maps work properly – again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By Saturday morning, officials had shut down <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10584785">647 government systems</a> fearing further damage. Government email and intranet systems ground to a halt. Mobile identification services went dark, as did postal banking, complaint portals, and major government websites.</p> <p>Schools could not access student records, and tax payment deadlines passed with systems offline. Real estate transactions stalled without digital document verification. A national crematorium booking system was affected, and some hospitals and transport terminals initially turned away citizens who lacked physical identification cards.</p> <p>As of 1pm on Tuesday, 89 of the 647 affected systems had been restored, including the main government portal, postal services, and identity verification systems.</p> <p>Officials estimate 96 of the systems affected were completely destroyed. Transferring them to a backup facility in Daegu will take approximately four weeks, meaning disruption will persist through Chuseok, a weeklong national holiday in early October.</p> <p>President Lee Jae Myung <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250928003800315">apologised</a> on Sunday. At a crisis meeting, he expressed shock at the lack of back-up operating systems. “This was a foreseeable incident, yet there were no countermeasures. It’s not that the measures failed to work – they simply did not exist,” he said.</p> <p>When officials struggled to answer questions about backup protocols, he <a href="https://www.president.go.kr/newsroom/briefing/rw7sBf3Q">accused them</a> of “driving without a map”.</p> <p>The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/apec-summit">APEC</a>) summit, being hosted in the south-eastern city of Gyeongju at the end of October, has heightened security concerns, with the leaders of the US, China and other regional powers set to attend.</p> <p>In October 2022, a lithium-ion battery <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2979601">fire crippled Kakao</a>, the company behind the country’s dominant super app KakaoTalk. Millions lost access to messenger communications, taxis and digital payments, causing <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2022/10/17/business/industry/Korea-Kakao-Kakao-Talk/20221017191936270.html">nationwide chaos</a>.</p> <p>After the Kakao fire, parliament <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2022/12/09/business/tech/Korea-Kakao-National-Assembly/20221209161832223.html">legislated</a> mandatory <a href="https://www.kimchang.com/en/insights/detail.kc?sch_section=4&amp;idx=28569">redundancy systems and spacing requirements</a> between batteries and other equipment for internet service providers and datacentre operators. </p> <p>The left-leaning Hankyoreh newspaper asked what last week’s failure said about “a country that calls itself an information technology powerhouse”.</p> <p>The conservative Dong-A Ilbo was equally scathing, noting that even mentioning South Korea’s status as a digital leader had become “embarrassing”.</p> <p>Politicians from both ruling and opposition camps <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-09-30/opinion/editorials/Political-blame-game-erupts-again-over-national-data-network-failure/2410870">traded accusations</a> over who bore responsibility. The presidential chief of staff, Kang Hoon-sik, instructed officials on Monday to solve problems rather than blame the previous administration.</p>
