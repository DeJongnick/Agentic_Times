<p>In south Wales on Monday, the leader of Reform UK offered a Farage mirage of reopened coalmines and blast furnaces (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/09/nigel-farage-reform-uk-welsh-elections-coalmining-revived">Nigel Farage’s pitch for Welsh elections: bring back coalmining, 9 June</a>). When questioned, he did not acknowledge the practical absurdity of such restorations; he&nbsp;responded with the conman’s alibi – they are “ambitions” and “nothing is impossible”.</p> <p>Welsh knowledge of the destruction of industries is tragic, profound and recent. By pretending that past can be reversed with just “a change of mindset”, Nigel Farage is showing contempt for the&nbsp;experience and intelligence of&nbsp;the people of Wales.</p> <p>Like all communities that have endured rapid and massive economic change without proper preparation or compensation, they&nbsp;need the realism and security of a productive green future, not the cynical dishonesty of a Trump&nbsp;tribute act.<br><strong>Neil Kinnock</strong><br><em>Labour, House of Lords</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
