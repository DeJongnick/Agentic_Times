<p>A growing number of studies suggest that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/jun/21/electric-vehicles-carsick">people experience more carsickness riding in electric vehicles (EVs)</a> compared to traditional petrol or diesel cars.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10447318.2025.2499155">2024 study</a> believes that regenerative braking technology – where the motor converts the slowing car’s kinetic energy into electricity that then is stored in the battery – results in <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-electric-and-automated-cars-are-aggravating-motion-sickness-204790">low-frequency deceleration</a>, meaning that the vehicle slows down gradually and steadily, over a relatively longer period, rather than rapidly or in quick pulses. Such low-frequency deceleration tends to be associated with <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2022.866503/full">higher levels of motion sickness.</a></p> <p>We’d like to hear from people about their experiences of feeling car sick while being a passenger or driving in an EV. How does it compare to being in a petrol or diesel car? Have you found a way to prevent you feeling motion sick?</p> <h2>This Community callout closed on 17 September 2025</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>You can see the article that included respondents to this callout <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/13/extreme-nausea-are-evs-causing-car-sickness-and-what-can-be-done">here</a>. </strong></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>You can contribute to open Community callouts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-community-team">here</a> or Share a story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/sep/02/guardianwitness-send-us-a-story">here</a>.</strong></p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="33550aad-3977-4d2c-93de-037a62ce2c2d" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>
