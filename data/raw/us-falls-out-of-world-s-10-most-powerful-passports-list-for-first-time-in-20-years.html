<p>For the first time in two decades, the US has dropped out of the world’s top 10 most powerful passports, marking a significant dethroning for the global superpower.</p> <p>According to the latest <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/passport-index">Henley Passport Index</a>, a ranking that measures how many countries a traveler can visit without needing a visa, the US passport now ranks 12th globally, sharing the position with Malaysia.</p> <p>Just last year, the US was in seventh place, before slipping to 10th in July of this year. Ten years ago, it was at the top of the list.</p> <p>“The declining strength of the US passport over the past decade is more than just a reshuffle in rankings – it signals a fundamental shift in global mobility and soft power dynamics,” Christian H Kaelin, chair of Henley &amp; Partners and creator of the index, said in a <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/newsroom/press-releases/henley-global-mobility-report-oct-2025">press release</a>. “Nations that embrace openness and cooperation are surging ahead, while those resting on past privilege are being left behind.”</p> <p>Asian countries currently dominate the upper ranks. Singapore leads with visa-free access to 193 destinations, followed by South Korea with 190, and Japan with 189.</p> <p>Henley &amp; Partners, a London-based firm specializing in citizenship and residency consulting, has compiled these rankings for about 20 years using data from the International Air Transport Association.</p> <p>The drop coincides with stricter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">US immigration</a> and travel policies under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>, which initially targeted unauthorized migration but have since extended to wider crackdowns on tourism, foreign workers and international students.</p> <p>Reciprocity plays a big role in a country’s rankings, Henley &amp; Partners noted, pointing out that while US passport holders can currently access 180 destinations visa-free, the US itself allows only 46 other nationalities to enter its borders without a visa.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/01/hooray-for-hollywood-why-tourists-are-giving-the-us-a-miss">Hooray for Hollywood? Why tourists are giving the US a miss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recent access changes have contributed to lower rankings across the board. In April, Brazil <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/4589454-this-country-will-require-americans-to-show-their-bank-statements-to-visit-heres-why/">ended visa-free entry</a> for Americans, Canadians and Australians, citing a lack of reciprocity.</p> <p>Other countries have expanded visa waivers, but not for Americans. China and Vietnam, for instance, have excluded the US from newly expanded lists of countries eligible for visa-free tourism.</p> <p>According to Henley &amp; Partners, countries that offer their citizens broad travel freedom but limit visa-free entry for others, such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, have seen their passport strength stagnate or decline over recent years.</p> <p>The dramatic fall in ranking is already fueling a desire for dual citizenship among Americans, the firm says, signaling that standalone US citizenship may not be the superpower status it once was.</p> <p>“In coming years, more Americans will be acquiring additional citizenships in whatever way they can,” Peter J Spiro, professor of law at Temple University Law School, said in a <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/newsroom/press-releases/henley-global-mobility-report-oct-2025">statement</a>. “Multiple citizenship is being normalized in American society.” While it may be a bit of an exaggeration, as one social media poster recently put it, “dual citizenship is the new American dream.”</p>
