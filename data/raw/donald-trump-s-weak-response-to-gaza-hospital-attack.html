<p>Had the nationality of the at least 193 journalists reporting on Gaza and killed since 7 October 2023 been American rather than Palestinian, would Donald Trump’s&nbsp;reaction have been any stronger than “I’m not happy about&nbsp;it” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/journalists-among-people-killed-by-israeli-strike-on-gaza-hospital">Israel bombed Gaza hospital a second time, killing rescuers, say health officials, 25 August</a>)?<br><strong>Anne Plunkett</strong><br><em>Shelf, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>• Your article on “performative males” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/22/labubus-bell-jar-tampons-performative-male-attracts-attention">22 August</a>) put me in mind of Jenny Eclair’s comedy routine about the need a boy has for a “northern mother”; she suggested Michael Jackson needed one to tell him to “go and fetch your other glove, Michael”. The equivalent today would presumably be “and take that Labubu off your belt”.<br><strong>Deb Groves</strong><br><em>Ribchester, Lancashire</em></p> <p>• August has hitherto been known in political circles as the “silly season”? Now that Nigel Farage has taken (back) control of the agenda, I’m with the late Edna O’Brien: “August is a wicked month”.<br><strong>Les Bright</strong><br><em>Exeter, Devon</em></p> <p>• I have a few vintage one-inch micrometers that fit snugly in a spectacle case (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/22/suffragettes-and-palestine-action">Letters, 22 August</a>), keeping a precision instrument safe.<br><strong>Chris Arrowsmith</strong><br><em>Cam, Gloucestershire</em></p> <p>• A surplus spectacle case lends itself to becoming a travelling humidor. Open and hold it over a steaming kettle for two seconds, pop in your cigar, and snap shut.<br><strong>Richard Barnard</strong><br><em>Wivenhoe, Essex </em></p> <p>• I find them particularly useful for storing 35mm film canisters.<br><strong>Andrew Eccles</strong><br><em>Gourock, Inverclyde</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
