<p>Coalition MP Colin Boyce told a group of climate science deniers that blackouts were “a big political opportunity” and that he had urged fellow MPs to adopt a “do nothing strategy” that would allow power outages and build opposition to net-zero policies.</p> 
<p>A video of Boyce, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8QYtvU5clQ&amp;t=3371s">posted on YouTube</a>, speaking to the Climate and Energy Realists Queensland group, includes comments by the Flynn MP that net-zero climate policies “need a rethink”.</p> 
<p>He said the cohort of like-minded politicians opposed to the transition to renewables “is growing”.</p> 
<p>“Politically, how do you sell that? That’s the problem,” Boyce told the meeting in December 2023.</p>

<p>“I’ve said this many times to the colleagues, we have to probably adopt a ‘do nothing’ strategy, obviously fight the good fight.</p> 
<p>“The ‘do nothing’ strategy is a tough love strategy where people will not understand what’s happening until the lights go out.</p> 
<p>“When the lifts in the building stop working and the supermarket shelves are empty because the refrigerators aren’t working, that’s when all of a sudden people start to realise.”</p> 
<p>Later, Boyce was asked a question about potential power outages and he responded by saying: “It’s a big political opportunity for that to happen.”</p> 
<p>Boyce predicted power outages would be “along similar lines” to the 1985 South East Queensland Electricity Generating Board strikes during the Joh Bjelke-Petersen government, which caused rolling power outages for four weeks.</p> 
<p>“It’s enormously frustrating and there’s no simple fixes to any of these problems,” Boyce said.</p> 
<p>“To turn the renewable energy ship around, where it sits at the moment will take a change of government.”</p> 
<p>The Nationals MP was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/new-coalition-mp-was-founding-member-of-club-promoting-climate-science-denial">founding member of the “Saltbush Club”</a>, formed to promote climate science denial, and was a signatory to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/26/co2-is-plant-food-australian-group-signs-international-declaration-denying-climate-science">international statement claiming “there is no climate emergency”</a>.</p> 
<p>Boyce has also been an advocate of the Coalition’s plans to build nuclear power generation.</p> 
<p>He told the group: “If I had my way I’d be building coal-fired power stations, full stop, that’s what I’d be doing.</p> 
<p>“We have these enormous reserves of coal and we should be using it.</p> 
<p>“Obviously as we go on to the future we should be exploring nuclear technology.</p> 
<p>“In the meantime we need to maintain our traditional coal-fired power fleet.”</p> 
<p>Guardian Australia contacted the Coalition and Boyce for comment but did not receive a response before publication. </p>
