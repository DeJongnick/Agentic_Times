<p>Morning, everyone. Some measure of how Australians feel about another Donald Trump presidency is offered today by our latest Guardian Essential poll which shows voters are worried about the impact he will have on security and the world economy. It comes as he has suggested he will use the military to enforce the deportation of illegal immigrants.</p> 
<p>In other news, Russia reacted angrily to Kyiv getting the green light for long-range missile strikes, Anthony Albanese met Xi Jinping, and Sam Kerr and her partner are having a baby.</p>

<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>Almost half of Australians (49%) believe immigration is too high but the large majority (71%) still think that migrants make the country stronger and that multiculturalism has benefited the nation (85%). These are perhaps contradictory findings from the Scanlon Foundation Research Institute’s annual survey, Mapping Social Cohesion, out today. One of the lead authors said that despite the stresses caused by the Middle East crisis, the findings “speak to the resilience” of Australian society. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/19/australia-social-cohesion-at-record-low-but-70-believe-migrants-make-country-stronger">Karen Middleton looks into the details</a>.</p>
