<p>On carbon policy, George Monbiot is correct to focus on realism, not perception (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/12/fossil-fuel-companies-environment-greenwashing">Out of 1,500 global climate policies, only 63 have really worked. That’s where green spin has got us, 12 September</a>). Large-scale aviation will not be carbon neutral for at least 50 years. This is not the largest source of carbon emissions, but it may have the dubious honour of needless emission (we need road/rail transport, food production and power generation more than we need cheap foreign holidays and intercontinental business travel).</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/aviation-fuel-plan-supports-growth-of-british-aviation-sector">previous government tried</a> “to ensure that the rationing&nbsp;of&nbsp;flights through ‘demand management’ is ruled out”. But, given that provision will rise to meet demand, the only limits on flights are legal frameworks and ticket prices. </p> <p>The way forward is to make ticket prices reflect the social cost of carbon, and channel the payment to those who bear the cost, ie poorer countries and our grandchildren more generally. That&nbsp;cost has been carefully <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05224-9">estimated by Kevin Rennert and co-authors</a>, writing in the journal Nature in October 2022.</p> <p>The logically and justly implied policy is a carbon tax at the level required to prevent us exploiting our descendants. Flights to and from the UK operated by airlines based elsewhere would have to face a commensurate levy. </p> <p>The principle must be stated now and then introduced over approximately the term of one parliament, to give businesses time to plan along with confidence that the change is unavoidable. The abolition of exploitation is not&nbsp;optional.<br><strong>Andrew Steane</strong><br><em>Professor of physics, Oxford University</em></p> <p>• George Monbiot cites “perceptionware” as the means to perpetuate what we know as “greenwash”. Are frequent flyers convinced by “perceptionware” and oblivious that aviation fuel contributes to climate change? I don’t think so – they fly frequently because they can. A real policy to reduce carbon from aviation would be rationing. For those who fly, one short-haul flight a year, maybe for a holiday, and one long-haul, to visit relations or for the “trip of a lifetime”. This doesn’t prevent holidaying but, for the rest of the time, we should “stay on the ground, protect the planet, save lives”. <br><strong>Janette Ward</strong><br><em>Tarrington, Herefordshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
