<p>Law firms that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/skadden-staffers-letter-trump">cut deals</a> with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">administration</a> after the president issued executive orders targeting attorneys who challenge his priorities are demonstrating “absolute cowardice”, the independent US senator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> has said.</p> <p>“They’re zillion-dollar law firms, and money, money, money” is all that motivates them, the popular Vermont lawmaker who caucuses with Democrats said in a feature <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-says-u-s-under-trump-is-facing-unprecedented-level-of-danger/">interview</a> on the latest CBS News Sunday Morning. “So they’re going to sell out their souls to be able to make money here in Washington.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trump-law-firm-executive-order">Two more law firms reach deals with Trump to avoid executive orders: ‘They’re all bending’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sanders’ remarks provided a notable condemnation of law firms who had represented political rivals of Trump then chose the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trump-law-firm-executive-order">path of least resistance</a> after he aimed orders that threatened to cripple them. The orders sought to revoke security clearances, ban attorneys from accessing federal buildings, and – if they do business with the government – to force the targeted firm’s clients to disclose existing relationships with them.</p> <p>Some of the US’s most prominent legal practices subsequently capitulated.
