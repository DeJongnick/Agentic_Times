<p><strong>Lucas, 23, Blackpool</strong></p>    <p><strong>Occupation</strong> Works for the NHS</p> <p><strong>Voting record </strong>Labour in 2024, which he&nbsp;now regrets – is considering voting Green or for Your party, if they get it together in time for the next election</p> <p><strong>Amuse bouche</strong> Lucas travels regularly to Manchester as part of Carnifolk, a&nbsp;performance art collective. He usually plays the role of a magical bureaucrat who sends people to fill out forms</p> <p><strong>Rose-Marie, 69, </strong><strong>north of England</strong></p>    <p><strong>Occupation</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>Retired, has worked in many different fields – with the police, at&nbsp;a newspaper, as a hotel inspector</p> <p><strong>Voting record</strong> Always Conservative, except when she voted for Tony Blair in&nbsp;1997. But last election, she couldn’t bring herself to vote Conservative, after&nbsp;everything they’d done with Covid</p> <p><strong>Amuse bouche </strong>For a while, Rose-Marie ran a French restaurant with her husband, who is originally from Argentina. When they sold up, many of&nbsp;their customers invited them over for&nbsp;dinner, because they created such a&nbsp;great atmosphere</p> <p><strong>For starters</strong></p> <p><strong>Lucas</strong> Rose-Marie is much older than me and she’s done a lot more in&nbsp;her life – some really fascinating things. She’s been all around the world. She&nbsp;was a&nbsp;wonderful person to talk to,&nbsp;composed and sure of herself.</p> <p><strong>Rose-Marie</strong> I thought, “He looks young.” He was very pleasant, very smiley. Naive, I would call him. He&nbsp;must have used the F-word about 15 times. It wasn’t offensive or aggressive, it was just “that fucking thing” and “those fucking people”. I&nbsp;don’t think he even realised he was&nbsp;doing it.</p> <p><strong>Lucas</strong> We both picked banquet C, which started with duck pancakes.</p> <p><strong>Rose-Marie</strong><strong> </strong>The second course was a&nbsp;chilli prawn thing, then a chicken sweet and sour – all delicious. I had two glasses of wine. He had two beers.</p>    <p><strong>The big beef</strong></p> <p><strong>Lucas</strong> The big point that we didn’t agree on was immigration. I would consider myself a European, a&nbsp;proud&nbsp;multiculturalist and very pro-immigration. Even down to the&nbsp;genetics of it all; the island nation that&nbsp;we are can’t survive without immigrants. Even the 19th- and 20th-century history of ideas – we&nbsp;owe&nbsp;a lot to the people who have come here. She was very staunchly anti-immigration, I’d go so far as&nbsp;to say conspiratorial.</p> <p><strong>Rose-Marie</strong><strong> </strong>I laid back on my chair with my arms folded, listening to what&nbsp;he had to say, and I felt like he was reading from a book on Trotsky and waving his arms about. Immigration is&nbsp;totally out of control. People are paying higher and higher taxes – it’s&nbsp;all&nbsp;going on immigrants who have no&nbsp;intention of working. It&nbsp;needs somebody strong to sort it out. And once the country is on a better footing, then it’ll be up to people to vote for something a bit more moderate.</p>    <p><strong>Sharing plate</strong></p> <p><strong>Lucas</strong> We are both very much for nuclear power. I was quite surprised about that. She believes in climate change, but I said, corporations get away with their climate-destroying policies by persuading you it’s your fault for not recycling enough. She didn’t agree with that.</p> <p><strong>Rose-Marie</strong> Without capitalism, where would we be? Sure, there are a lot of companies that take the Michael. But he was on a roll – he was saying that he was a total socialist, bordering on communism. Then he went on about energy and windmills and all the rest&nbsp;of it. I said, “We have a sea in Scotland that we can have lots of oil, lots of gas out of, until we sort our energy problems out.”</p>    <p><strong>For afters</strong></p> <p><strong>Lucas</strong><em> </em>I don’t like Trump; I compared him to a ghoulish creature of the village. There were economics points that she agreed with him over. And I&nbsp;was, like, look at the number of times he’s bankrupted himself …</p> <p><strong>Rose-Marie</strong> He started ranting about Trump and the trouble he’s getting us&nbsp;into, comparing it to the Cuban missile crisis. I had to say, “Son, hold&nbsp;on a minute, the Cuban missile crisis? Do you know who the president at the&nbsp;time was?” And he said, “No,&nbsp;not really.” Trump’s a&nbsp;Marmite character, there’s things I&nbsp;hate about&nbsp;him and&nbsp;things I think he’s done&nbsp;well, and&nbsp;that’s it.</p>    <p><strong>Takeaway</strong></p> <p><strong>Lucas</strong> We were quite present. I really liked her company.</p> <p><strong>Rose-Marie</strong> We didn’t argue, but we had different opinions. I think it was to&nbsp;do with his naivety.</p>    <p><em>Additional reporting: Kitty Drake</em></p> <p>• Lucas and Rose-Marie ate at <a href="https://www.michaelwansmandarin.co.uk/">Michael Wan’s Mandarin</a> in Blackpool</p> <p>Want to meet someone from across the divide? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/24/second-homes-big-tech-smoking-we-want-your-views-on-divisive-issues">Find out how to take part</a>.</p>
