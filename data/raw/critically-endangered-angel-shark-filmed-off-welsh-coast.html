<p>One of the world’s rarest sharks has been filmed off the Welsh coast, offering a fleeting glimpse into the life of a species teetering on the brink of extinction.</p> 
<p>Underwater footage shows a critically endangered angel shark swimming through the waters of Cardigan Bay – the first time it has been recorded on film in the area since 2021.</p> 
<p>The shark was captured by cameras deployed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW), designed to monitor biodiversity as part of a project investigating marine life in the region, many of which are under threat from human activities.</p> 
<p>“We were thrilled to record an angel shark in Cardigan Bay, a rare and exciting encounter,” said Dr Sarah Perry, marine conservation and research manager at WTSWW.</p> 
<p>“Before this project started, angel sharks hadn’t been captured on film in Cardigan Bay since 2021.”</p> 
<p>Angel sharks are listed as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list, with populations in steep decline due to habitat loss and commercial fishing.</p> 
<p>With numbers of the species falling, the shark is especially vulnerable to bottom trawling – the industrial fishing practice of dragging vast, weighted nets along the sea floor, scooping up everything in their path.</p> 
<p>“While Cardigan Bay and other vital habitats are full of incredible wildlife and store vast amounts of carbon, yet they are threatened with destruction by industrial-scale fishing in many areas,” WTSWW said.</p>

<p>Despite the decline, Dr Perry said the sighting “comes at a crucial time, as the Senedd and UK government discuss a ban on bottom trawling in marine protected areas”.</p> 
<p>And while Wales has 139 designated marine protected areas (MPAs), conservationists say many still remain exposed to damaging activities such as trawling, dredging and even seabed mining.</p> 
<p>Angel sharks – slow to reproduce and adapted to life near the ocean floor – are particularly susceptible to these pressures.</p> 
<p>The UK parliament’s environmental audit committee has recommended a full ban on bottom trawling within MPAs, calling for stronger protection of marine habitats across the board.</p> 
<p>Ministers have previously suggested they might take action, and while protections exist against harmful fishing practices in around 60% of marine protected areas, a full ban has yet to be implemented.</p> 
<p>Environmental groups warn that without urgent and comprehensive protection, species like the angel shark could disappear entirely from UK waters.</p> 
<p>The Wildlife Trusts are urging the public to take part in an open UK government consultation on banning bottom trawling in MPAs, which remains open over the summer.</p>
