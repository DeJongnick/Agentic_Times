<h2>ECHOES THROUGH TIME </h2> <p>Some things never change. Consider the events of January 1907, for example, when Liverpool travelled to a frozen Roker Park and built themselves a comfy 4-1 half-time lead. Jack Parkinson, Sam Raybould and Jack Cox were scintillating in attack, coming at hosts Sunderland from all angles, at pace, “like a fleet of ships” according to the Liverpool Echo. But as the paper also pointed out, “a battle is never lost until it is won”, and Sunderland came back out for the second half in determined fashion. Liverpool started conceding rash fouls and penalty kicks, the not-yet-woke Manchester Guardian observing that Sunderland’s comeback was because of a “fatal departure on the part of Liverpool from the clean game, which is by no means necessarily tame and effeminate”. The end result was 5-5. It was the first time Liverpool had ever given up a three-goal lead. Oh Liverpool!<br></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/22/jordan-henderson-liverpool-defence-sevilla-champions-league">Jordan Henderson: Don’t blame defence for Liverpool’s Sevilla collapse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Did something horrific take hold in the Liverpool psyche that day? Well, just consider the evidence. A mere 34,188 days later, Gérard Houllier’s side went three up against Southampton at the Dell, only for Matt Le Tissier to come on, waddle about a bit, yawn, scratch his arse and inspire his team, Marian Pahars et al, to an unlikely draw. Then, 14 years on, you’ve got Crystanbul. Oh Brendan! Oh Luis! So it’s happened three times at the very least. Probably more, if we nose through the record books further, but we have to send this thing out today, give us a break will you. Anyway, three’s enough. QED!!! And now this fiasco in Seville. Oh Jürgen! You’re going to have to address this problem at some point, you know. It’s like rising damp, it’s not just going to go away.</p> <p>Of course, pinpointing the exact root of such a structural problem is easier said than done. Both of Liverpool’s goalkeepers have soft potato patties for palms and marinated anchovies for fingers; the combined age of all the fit right-backs in the first-team squad is 13-and-three-quarters; and the most dependable central defender in Tuesday night’s XI was Dejan Lovren. Scary enough, although to be fair, Liverpool could replace poor, sweet, confused Alby Moreno with Giacinto Facchetti and Paolo Maldini doubling up, and they’d still concede goals on account of having covering midfielders so immobile they make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/21/damien-hirsts-preserved-carcasses-leaked-formaldehyde-gas-study-claims">Damien Hirst’s Mother and Child (Divided)</a> look like Seabiscuit and Red Rum.<br></p> <p>With this point uppermost in mind, Jordan Henderson has today done a spot of fessing up, admitting that while the defence may be a creaking calamity, they shouldn’t be copping all the flak for the latest collapse, as the whole team were to blame. “I thought we defended well,” he began, brushing puddles of formaldehyde from his shoulders. “But we stopped playing, stopped getting the ball up to the front three. They were getting it back cheaply and it invites pressure.” The deflated Liverpool captain was left scrabbling around for positives. “On paper it is a good result, and we still have it in our own hands.” He might also consider that, in football, what goes around comes around, and Liverpool have been known to launch the odd thrilling three-goal comeback themselves. Manchester United in 1994, for example, or Milan in 2005. It’s a pattern that suggests another is well overdue, perhaps imminent. So here’s to being three down at home to Chelsea by six o’clock on Saturday evening, then, eh Liverpool fans.
