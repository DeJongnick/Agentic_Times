<p>Sir Tony Blair met Jeffrey Epstein in Downing Street while he was prime minister after a recommendation by Peter Mandelson, newly released papers from the National Archives show.</p> <p>Epstein visited Blair on 14 May 2002, after the suggestion by Lord Mandelson to the prime minister’s then chief of staff, Jonathan Powell.</p> <p>Mandelson was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations">sacked as US ambassador in September</a> after new information emerged about how close he was to the convicted sex offender.</p> <p>At the time of the recommendation, Mandelson was a backbench Labour MP but still served as a trusted ally to Blair. Just over a year earlier he had resigned from government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jan/24/labour.labour1997to99">a second time amid controversy.</a> He had described Epstein to Powell as “safe” and a “friend” in an email before the meeting.</p> <p>Powell is now Keir Starmer’s national security adviser. His role has been questioned in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/06/jonathan-powell-to-face-mps-over-role-in-collapse-of-espionage-trial">collapse of a Chinese spying case.</a></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/11/tony-blair-and-nick-clegg-hosted-dinner-giving-tech-bosses-access-to-uk-minister">Tony Blair and Nick Clegg hosted dinner giving tech bosses access to UK minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to papers released to the BBC, a briefing memo by the senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft described Epstein as a friend of Mandelson and the former US president Bill Clinton, as well as being close to Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Blair said the meeting was “long before his [Epstein’s] crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction”.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said Powell had only forwarded the request in his role as chief of staff. </p> <p>Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. He died in prison in 2019.</p> <p>The release of the documents had been blocked by government officials over concerns it may affect UK-US relations. However, the National Archives has now released the document as a result of a freedom of information request.</p> <p>The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yk16gpxj0o">reported that an email from Mandelson to Powell</a> a week before the meeting said: “Do you remember when Clinton saw TB [Tony Blair] he said he wanted to introduce his travelling friend, Jeffrey Epstein, to TB?</p> <p>“This was frustrated – TB said at the time – in the office for reasons (he says) he was unclear about. I think TB would be interested in meeting Jeffrey, who is also a friend of mine, because Jeffrey is an active scientific catalyst/entrepreneur as well as someone who has his finger on the pulse of many worldwide markets and currencies.</p> <p>“He is young and vibrant. He is safe (whatever that means) and Clinton is now doing a lot of travelling with him.”</p> <p>Mandelson went on: “I mentioned to TB that Jeffrey is in London next week and he said he would like to meet him.</p> <p>“I have ascertained from Jeffrey that he is flexible – he could be here any time from Tuesday onwards to fit round the diary – but would obviously need to know reasonably quickly so as to re-schedule accordingly. Can you let me know?”</p> <p>A later briefing by Rycroft – who went on to serve as permanent secretary at the Home Office until 2025 – on the day of the meeting said about Epstein: “He is a financial adviser to the super-rich and a property developer. He is a friend of Bill Clinton and Peter Mandelson.”</p> <p>He added: “The background on Epstein is that he is very rich and close to the Duke of York.”</p> <p>He continued: “Peter says that Epstein now travels with Clinton and Clinton wants you to meet him.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Blair said: “As far as he can remember, Mr Blair met with him for less than 30 minutes in Downing Street in 2002 and discussed US and UK politics.</p> <p>“He never met or engaged with him subsequently. This was, of course, long before his crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “Jonathan Powell forwarded on the request, he had no further role.” </p>
