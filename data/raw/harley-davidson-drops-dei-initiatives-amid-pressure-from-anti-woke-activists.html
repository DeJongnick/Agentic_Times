<p>Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson has become the latest manufacturer to drop <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/16/diversity-dei-us-companies-backlash">diversity, equity and inclusion</a> initiatives amid sustained pressure from anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck.</p> <p>In a statement Monday, the Milwaukee-based company said it has not operated a corporate DEI function since April, no longer has minority-owned supplier goals and plans to exit socially motivated training for employees.</p> <p>Harley-Davidson’s statement, posted on X, said that it sees “every leader’s role to ensure we have an employee base that reflects our customers and the geographies in which we operate” – and the company would limit training to legal requirements.</p> <p>“We are saddened by the negativity on social media over the last few weeks, designed to divide the Harley-Davidson community,” <a href="https://twitter.com/harleydavidson/status/1825564138032234994">the statement said</a>. “As a company, we take this issue very seriously, and it is our responsibility to respond with clarity, action and facts.”</p> <p>The company said in the statement that it will also reorganize employee resource groups to focus on business development, mentoring and training. Having a “broad customer base is good for business”, it added.</p> <p>Harley-Davidson has been in the cross-hairs of anti-DEI activists who earlier this summer won similar concessions from retailer Tractor Supply and farming equipment maker John Deere &amp; Co. The tractor maker said in a statement in July it would <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-16/deere-backs-down-from-diversity-initiatives-after-online-attacks">no longer participate</a> in “cultural awareness parades”.</p> <p>The motorcycle maker said in an email to staff that it began a review of its “stakeholder and outreach activities” earlier this year. Harley-Davidson had been under attack from anti-DEI activist Starbuck, who accused it of adopting “the woke agenda of the very far left”.</p> <p>More broadly, the issue of DEI has become a political lightning rod that reflects US political divisions, with American businesses anticipating an even broader roll-back of such initiatives if Donald Trump wins a second presidency in November. </p> <p>“It’s time to get rid of these policies and bring back a sense of neutrality and sanity in corporate America,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-19/harley-drops-diversity-initiatives-maligned-by-anti-dei-activist?sref=fqqmZ8gi">Starbuck said in an interview with Bloomberg</a>, pointing to activism on social media by Harley-Davidson influencers for the company’s move. He reportedly added: “We kind of reached critical mass.”</p> <p>Harley-Davidson’s shares are up 5% since Starbuck started his campaign in July, according to the outlet.</p> <p>Earlier this year, a Washington Post-Ipsos poll found 61% of adults think DEI programs in the workplace are “a good thing”. But another <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648269/americans-business-stay-quiet-public-policy.aspx?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top" title="Gallop poll">survey</a> from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/78145MF:US">Bentley University</a> and Gallop found that fewer than four in 10 US adults (38%) believe businesses should take public stances, a decline of 10% since 2022.</p> <p>Harley-Davidson became a focus of Trump’s attention in 2018 after it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/26/trump-threatens-harley-davidson-tariff-big-tax">responded to his administration’s tariffs</a> by moving some production overseas. The former president subsequently encouraged people to boycott the company.</p> <p>The company has also grappled with falling demand from younger buyers for its old-school touring bikes – or “hogs” – according to one analyst who has said “an experience for them is not about hitting the open road”.</p> <p>Harley-Davidson’s decision to drop DEI training received pushback on Tuesday from Eric Bloem, the <a href="https://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a> president, who criticized the company’s decision as “impulsive”.</p> <p>“With nearly 30% of gen Z identifying as LGBTQ+ and the community wielding $1.4tn in spending power, retreating from these principles undermines both consumer trust and employee success,” <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/hrc-statement-on-harley-davidsons-retreat-from-values-of-diversity-equity-and-inclusion">Bloem said in a statement</a>.</p> <p>There had been a national shift in favor of DEI initiatives after the 2020 murder of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd">George Floyd</a>, who was Black, by a white police officer in Minneapolis.</p>
