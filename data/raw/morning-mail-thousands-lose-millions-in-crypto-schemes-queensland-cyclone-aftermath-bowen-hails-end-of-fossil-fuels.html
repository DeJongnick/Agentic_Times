<p>Good morning. Thousands of people have lost millions of dollars to crypto investment schemes that were flagged by the New Zealand regulator as a possible “scam” and by another overseas regulator as a “suspected pyramid scheme”, while escaping such scrutiny in Australia, a Guardian Australia investigation has found.</p> 
<p>Tropical Cyclone Jasper has been downgraded to a tropical low but still carries the threat of life-threatening flooding in north Queensland as the storm moves across the peninsula to the gulf. Chris Bowen says the “age of fossil fuels will end” and scientists might be close to a cure for morning sickness.</p>
