<h2><strong>Arsenal</strong></h2> <p>Optimism abounds in London N5. I had some doubts about Arteta’s ability to keep motivating this group, but this summer’s heavy spend should fix that, reinvigorating the squad. Only time will tell whether the new faces can gel and develop chemistry, but it’s a relief to have the clamour for a centre-forward answered at last. Hopefully come May we’ll be lauding Victor’s <em>veni, vidi, vici</em> Premier League triumph.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Keeping our star turns fit – Gabriel, Rice and Saka – remains crucial. Beyond that there are lots of unknowns. Can Ødegaard rekindle his role as our creator-in-chief, or will Nwaneri force his way in? Can Zubimendi form an effective partnership with Declan Rice and impose himself as our midfield fulcrum? Will Martinelli, Trossard and Madueke chip in with the 10‑15 goals required to alleviate our reliance on Saka, thereby reducing the burden on Gyökeres? And how much will we see of our 15-year-old prodigy Max Dowman?</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>Nobody will complain if the spending stops here, after half a dozen new arrivals already. But there would also be few arguments if the club managed to land an Eze-like bonus too.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>Gyökeres: guaranteed to be the subject of intense media scrutiny. Our days of speculating about what might have been if only we’d signed a striker sooner are over. Now it’s time to find out.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the new kit?</strong> I’m a traditionalist; I think our kits should always be red and white and yellow and blue. This season there’s an all-blue away kit and a white third. Marvellous fashion items, maybe, but if we don’t win in them, they’ll fast lose their allure.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>1st. Based on the law of averages, I’ll be right one of these days. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Arsenal; 2. Liverpool; 3. Man City; 4. Chelsea. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. Sunderland; 19. Leeds; 20. Burnley. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Scott Parker.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Bernard Azulay </strong><a href="https://onlinegooner.com/">onlinegooner.com</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/goonern5">@GoonerN5</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Aston Villa</strong></h2> <p>There’s a nagging feeling in the fan base that last year was a high-water mark. With the rules making it nigh-on impossible for the “disruptors” to make sustained progress, clubs like ours can do nothing but Bark at the Moon. Sixth to eighth is probably our range, but those that find that prospect dull really should be more balanced. We are playing European football, we’ll have a chance in the cups and we’ve got a Wizard of a manager.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links?</strong> The wellbeing of the spine of Konsa, Tielemans, Rogers and Watkins, all of whom made 50+ appearances last year, will be fundamental – and Kamara’s fitness will be crucial too. Also worth keeping an eye on Onana and Maatsen, who could have statement seasons. Weaknesses? Whisper it quietly but Martínez had a less-than-convincing 2024‑25. But you’d always back such a character to shake that off.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>I’d expect one more (net) arrival by window-shut. We need cover at right-back as Cash is injury-prone. As for attacking threat, I made the classic mistake of falling in love with a loan player (Rashford) last year, so I’m hoping new boy Evann Guessand will step Into the Void.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is… </strong>Martínez isn’t a Hellraiser but his “housery” and his shot-stopping are on different trajectories at the moment and he’s worth 50p to be the first keeper to be sent off for general insubordination. Still wouldn’t swap him, though!</p> <p><strong>Happy with the new kit? </strong>I can’t see much difference between this year’s and last’s. But it’s claret and blue in the right proportions so yes, I’m happy I guess. It’s all a tax on the fan anyway.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>7th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Liverpool; 2. Man City; 3. Arsenal; 4. Chelsea. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. Brentford; 19. Sunderland; 20. Wolves. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Ruben Amorim.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Jonathan Pritchard </strong>(<em>With thanks to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/30/fans-line-streets-of-birmingham-to-say-farewell-to-ozzy-osbourne">Ozzy</a> and all the Holte Enders in the Sky</em>.)</p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Bournemouth</strong></h2> <p>Realistically, last season is going to be hard to beat. Progress off the pitch will be marked by the much-needed expansion of the stadium and the recruitment of key players to fill gaps left by big departures. On it, I can’t really see us hitting a top-10 finish. Mid-table and 50 points would feel like a huge win when you look at where we are currently. A cup semi-final would be a bonus.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Key will be Antoine Semenyo, Justin Kluivert, Evanilson and the returning-from-injury Ryan Christie. The sales of Kerkez and Huijsen and likely exit of Zabarnyi will leave gaping holes in our defence that need filling. We’re all looking forward to seeing Eli Junior Kroupi make his debut for the team after joining from Lorient, and this could be a breakthrough season for James Hill, a defensive utility man who will likely have much more game time compared with 2024-25.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>Defenders. Lille’s Bafodé Diakité and Seville’s Loïc Badé are both potential options being explored – but not only by Bournemouth. Fingers crossed we can get one or both done. Every team knows we need new recruits at the back, so high-quality bargains aren’t easy to find. In our recruitment team we trust, but the pressure is definitely on them to deliver.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>It could be fitness coach Pablo de la Torre, booked several times last season. Could he build on those performances and get in a proper fight with an official this season?</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>Yes. The subtle wave to the red and black stripes pays a nice homage to our seaside roots. And the black and blue stripes of the away kit are already a firm fan’s favourite, harking back to past seasons, most recently 2011-12.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>12th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Liverpool; 2. Manchester City; 3. Arsenal; 4. Tottenham (yawn). <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. Manchester United or Leeds; 19. Burnley; 20. Sunderland. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Scott Parker.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Jeff Hayward </strong>Back of the Net, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@afcbpodcast">AFC Bournemouth Fan’s Podcast</a>.</p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Brentford</strong></h2> <p>I’m surprisingly optimistic. OK, losing your manager, backroom staff, top scorer and captain and seeing your star striker do as his job title suggests – go on strike – doesn’t look good on paper, but I see this as an exciting new horizon. Employing set-piece coach Keith Andrews looks a safe move to me, not a risky one. The club knows him well and would rather employ someone who understands the Brentford way. We knew Mbeumo was going, we have the funds to replace him, so now it’s up to the club to deliver. We’re backed by many to go down; I’ll be more than happy with a finish anywhere above 14th in what is a massive transitional season for us.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>There is a lot of pressure on Kevin Schade and Igor Thiago to deliver, with Mbeumo and, probably, Wissa gone. Fabio Carvalho and Keane Lewis-Potter, back in his original role on the wing after filling in at left-back for the best part of two seasons, are still to show they have the attacking flare out wide displayed by their predecessors. The one new player causing much excitement is 20-year-old Antoni Milambo. He’s got some dancing feet on him. And it’s great to see Aaron Hickey and Rico Henry back to tighten up our defence; with the experienced Jordan Henderson sitting in front of them, I expect us to keep things tight at the back with some great distribution to our forward line, which is still a work in progress.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>Replacements for Mbeumo and Wissa. Ipswich’s Omari Hutchinson and Bournemouth’s Dango Ouattara are among those linked.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>He’s been with us for a year and has hardly kicked a ball, but Igor Thiago looks like a right character. He seems to be loving life in London.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>I quite like the new home kit, bar the strange grandad neck. Our new away kit is a chocolate brown colour. The last time we had a brown away kit we didn’t win our first away match until January, and won only won twice all season…</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>14th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Liverpool; 2. Arsenal; 3. Chelsea; 4. Man City. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. Everton; 19. Burnley ; 20. Sunderland. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Nuno Espírito Santo.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Billy Grant </strong><a href="https://beesotted.com/">Beesotted</a> podcast and blog; <a href="https://twitter.com/Beesotted">@Beesotted</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/billythebee99">@BillyTheBee99</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Brighton</strong></h2> <p>Europe has to be the target. It’s Fabian Hürzeler’s second season and we’ve made more exciting additions to the squad. It’s gutting to see João Pedro become the latest Brighton player to succumb to the Chelsea nonsense but no one can wait to see what the Greek youngsters Stefanos Tzimas and Charalampos Kostoulas can bring. Our transfer business was mostly done early in the window so Hürzeler’s had a great pre-season without a draining overseas tour. With our new Dutch goalkeeping coach, Jelle ten Rouwelaar, we’ll hopefully start saving some penalties, and we can say goodbye to our old wobbly defence now we’ve got Maxim De Cuyper, Olivier Boscagli and Diego Coppola.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>With João Pedro gone, Danny Welbeck will be key, while Brajan Gruda really started to show his quality at the end of last season. Charlie Tasker, who has been at the club since he was eight, was in a few matchday squads and has had a decent pre-season so watch out for him, too. Weak links? We’ve got Tony Bloom, so we don’t have any.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>We don’t need anyone else. If we did Uncle Tony would have got them already.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>Now Hürzeler has grown up a bit and is nearly 32 and a half, he might not get shown the red card so often. So maybe it’ll be the ridiculously flamboyant Georginio drawing focus with all his Pokémon cards, racehorses and excited babbles to camera.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>Football shirts are far too expensive and glamorous for me but I do love our iconic blue and white stripes. And it seems that this season’s version – with a purple away strip – has been well received.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>6th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Arsenal; 2. Liverpool; 3. Manchester City; 4. Chelsea. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. Crystal Palace; 19. Burnley; 20. Sunderland. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Graham Potter.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Steph Fincham</strong></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Burnley</strong></h2> <p>I think we’re approaching the Premier League with a different strategy this time around. Scott Parker is a far more pragmatic coach than Vincent Kompany and we should be a lot harder to score against. The signings, on paper, look to be good – a mix of the very experienced (Kyle Walker) and some younger talent to get the fans excited. It’s not going to be easy – we know how big the gap is – but signing someone like Walker at least gives you a chance of building the right culture to stay up.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Maxime Estève is key. The lad is a Rolls-Royce of a footballer and if we’re to stay up he’ll play a key role in the heart of the defence. The weak link is probably up top – do we have enough goals to survive? The jury is definitely still out.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>The obvious areas at the start of the window were a goalkeeper, a strong central midfielder and a striker, and that’s probably the top of the shopping list. There’s been plenty of links and it looks like we will have one in each of those positions – Martin Dubravka, Lesley Ugochukwu and Armando Broja.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>It’s got to be Hannibal. I described him a few times as a “busy idiot” in the opening weeks of last season but after serving a ban for a stupid stamp on a Sunderland player he came back and was magnificent. He’s the kind of player who gets the opposition riled up and he’s the player away fans will love to hate I’m sure. Aside from that, we’ve still got Ashley Barnes who lives for a wind-up, so keep an eye on him on the touchline warming up.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the new kit? </strong>Yeah on the whole, two very nice kits so far. Hate betting sponsors, but we are where we are. Both should look fantastic on the TV!</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>16th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Liverpool; 2. Arsenal; 3. Manchester City; 4. Manchester United. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. Wolves; 19. Sunderland; 20. Leeds. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Graham Potter.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Andrew Greaves </strong><a href="https://www.fromthebeeholeend.com/">From the Bee Hole End </a>podcast, <a href="https://x.com/beeholepodcast?lang=en">@beeholepodcast</a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://x.com/andrewgreaves84?lang=en">@andrewgreaves84</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Chelsea</strong></h2> <p>I’m cautiously optimistic. The players should be on a high after the Club World Cup, and hopefully Maresca will expand on his tactics and give us the exciting football we all want. This side is totally capable of delivering it. A strong finish to last season should enable us to push on; top four is the minimum expectation, plus a strong showing in the Champions League.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Key again will be James, Cucurella, Caicedo, Enzo and Palmer, with a lot of rotation among the rest of the squad. I don’t think we’ll get the 30-goal-a-season striker our support craves but João Pedro and Delap should be entertaining, while the stand-out player among the promising youngsters is Estêvão. Weaknesses? While Robert Sánchez had a good end to the season in goal I still see him as an issue.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>I wouldn’t be surprised to see Mike Maignan join us. And Fofana’s ongoing injury concerns may mean we dip in to the market again. But realistically the rest of the window is more about who leaves: Sterling, Chilwell, Disasi and Nkunku are among a long list looking for exits. Maresca’s biggest challenge will again be keeping everyone happy and he won’t have the luxury of the Conference League to give squad players opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>Cole Palmer is becoming the side’s biggest personality, whether that’s intentional or not. His pre- and post-match interviews are gold compared to the usual media-trained Q&amp;As. His double act with Tosin will hopefully encourage others to come out of their shells.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the new kit? </strong>It’s a decent blue. I’d move the tacky Club World Cup badge to the sleeve as it will all look a bit busy if/when we get a new sponsor.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>3rd. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Liverpool; 2. Manchester City; 3. Chelsea; 4. Arsenal. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. West Ham; 19. Sunderland; 20. Burnley. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Daniel Farke.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Paul Baker</strong> in memory of Trizia Fiorellino</p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Crystal Palace</strong></h2> <p>It’s been a frustrating summer: it felt like a lot of decisions were on hold pending a verdict on which European competition Uefa would let us play in. So it’s been uneventful, but that’s been a positive in some ways: Marc Guéhi still being here is a welcome surprise, we’ve lost no other key players (yet) and we’ve actually strengthened in a couple of key positions through the signing of Walter Benítez as a back-up keeper and Borna Sosa as competition for Tyrick Mitchell at left-wing back. The target will be to improve on last season’s points tally and go deep in the cup competitions once again.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Eberechi Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta have looked imperious in pre-season, and they, along with Daniel Muñoz, Adam Wharton and Ismaïla Sarr, will be key to our success. Academy centre-back Mofe Jemide has been given minutes already and forward Hindolo Mustapha may feature. By far the most important person, though, is Oliver Glasner; the journey he has taken this club on in such a short period of time is incredible and it is imperative that he agrees a new contract soon or there will be a lot of noise on his future as the season advances.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>Glasner wants another centre-back, a central midfielder and an attacker. We’ve been heavily linked with defenders Yann Bisseck at Inter and Sporting’s Ousmane Diomande – and Nice attacker Evann Guessand was mentioned before he went to Villa. I wouldn’t rule out a loan from the Chelsea player lake, either.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>We all hope Mateta will keep smiling and kicking corner flags.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the new kit? </strong>Not bad, though the white stripes on the shoulders are too wide. The all-gold kit celebrating the FA Cup win has no elements of Palace in it.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>10th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Liverpool; 2. Manchester City; 3. Arsenal; 4. Chelsea. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. West Ham; 19. Leeds; 20. Burnley. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Daniel Farke.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Chris Waters </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/Clapham_Grand">@Clapham_Grand</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Everton</strong></h2> <p>I’ve got Schrödinger’s optimism which is simultaneously alive and dead – it all depends on the transfer window, how and when we can fill the obvious gaps in a threadbare squad. I have great faith in Moyes’ ability to get the best of what is available. I expect us to be hugely difficult to play against away from home. We won’t score too many but defensively we will be very strong. How quickly we can settle into the new stadium is a considerable unknown – one thing for sure is the immense atmosphere it will create. Target has to be Europa League or Conference League qualification</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Pickford, Branthwaite, Tarkowski and O’Brien are key. Weaknesses: right wing, left back, proven scorers and creative midfielders. Bringing Alcaraz back is a plus and Thierno Barry from Villarreal is a huge prospect. And watch out for 18-year-old midfielder Harrison Armstrong, who has been at the club since age of five.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>Five or six at a minimum given our squad has only 19 current members including Chermiti and Séamus Coleman … Dewsbury-Hall could blossom under Moyes’ tutelage. Controversially, I think Grealish might be the spark we need. Our new recruitment team/committee has much to do. Thankfully funding is not the issue it was.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>On the pitch it’s Pickford, still a great character despite his now obvious maturity. Off it, I’m backing Moyes to take on the elder statesman role among top-flight managers. Don’t be shy, David!</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>Being a grumpy old man, I think the new Castore kit is atrocious. Moving to our new stadium I wanted a classic (think of the 1970 championship-winning kit worn with such panache by Ball, Kendall, Harvey and Royle – royal blue with a round white collar). And we still have that awful shirt sponsor …</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>8th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Arsenal; 2. Liverpool; 3. Manchester City; 4. Aston Villa. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. Leeds; 19. Burnley; 20. Sunderland. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Enzo Maresca.</p> <p><strong>• Paul Quinn</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/theesk">@theesk</a>, <a href="http://www.theesk.org/">theesk.org</a></p>    <h2><strong>Fulham</strong></h2> <p>While Marco Silva’s at the helm there’s plenty of optimism about. He’s continued to forge a squad full of drive, quality, togetherness and belief – but, as last season proved, it needs bolstering or there’s every chance we’ll run out of steam once again. The cosseted mega-wealthy clubs have scoured the globe and splashed millions on fresh talent, whereas our lot’s vision has seemed limited to SW6 and the local pier. New contracts for Kenny Tete, Josh King, Harry Wilson, Tom Cairney and co (OK, plus a cross-channel sortie to nab back-up keeper Benjamin Lecomte) were great business and a sign of stability, but where’s the smattering of new blood to provide fresh competition for places, that extra edge and to give the supporters a lift?</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Curious that the ever-improving Rodrigo Muniz is being linked with other clubs when he should be established as the club’s main striker for years to come. Despite varied and indifferent service (or the fact that he’s often sat on the bench!), the 24-year-old’s goals return is impressive. And maybe King’s new long-term contract means he’ll get more game time too; hope so.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>The much-mooted return of Reiss Nelson hasn’t happened yet, while another winger, Raheem Sterling on the huge surplus pile at Chelsea, has also been linked. Either way, I’m counting on Emile Smith-Rowe making a much greater impression having arrived late in the day this time last year with precious little pre-season training or time to fully integrate.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>There’s big Calvin Bassey, of course, plus Roadrunner Robinson meep-meeping back and forth down the left, but Marco’s the main man at the local football club.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>Oh it’s smart, no question; it’s sleek; but it’s all white. Black mark going against tradition with the shorts. The 90s throwback second strip, complete with old badge, looks the biz.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>Let’s be bold. 9th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Manchester City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Chelsea; 4. Newcastle. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. Brentford; 19. Sunderland; 20. Burnley. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Keith Andrews.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>David Lloyd </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/dmltoofif">@DMLTOOFIF</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Leeds</strong></h2> <p>Optimism is poison for newly promoted teams. But Leeds United are not just any newly promoted team. Coming up the last three times, in 1964, 1990 and 2020, the Peacocks finished 2nd, 4th and 9th. History provides an ever-present tension at Leeds and survival is never seen as enough. On top of all the expected pressure of the Premier League will be a strong internal need for more, for better, for properly reasserting ourselves – after 25 years – back where we belong. I think we probably will stay up. I think it probably will be fraught.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Summer transfers have concentrated on six-footers in their mid-20s, so the spirit of Tony Pulis could have a big part to play. After years of froth around Illan Meslier, it’ll help if big-punching new goalie Lucas Perri convinces as No 1. Wilf Gnonto, still only 21, is a lively winger who wants headlines, while we’re hoping for some sensations from the next of the Gray line, 16-year-old striker Harry, before inevitably selling him to Spurs.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>Forwards. Transfer business has beefed up the back but after missing out on Igor Paixão, telling Pat Bamford he can go and hearing Mateo Joseph has asked to, new attackers are necessary.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>I’m a big enjoyer of Big Joe Rodon. There’s no more emotional centre‑half and I’m looking forward to Monday Night Football analysis of Joe flinging himself on the floor in 4K, feeling upset.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>Red bulls make a white shirt look like a Red Bull shirt from Leipzig, New York or anywhere, and somehow less like Leeds. But the blue away kit is a nice throwback to 2003, Mark Viduka and staying up at Highbury.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>16th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Liverpool; 2. Manchester City; 3. Crystal Palace; 4. Arsenal. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. Manchester United; 19. Brentford; 20. West Ham. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Keith Andrews.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Daniel Chapman </strong><a href="https://www.leedsista.com/">leedsista.com</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/leedsista.com">@leedsista.com</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Liverpool</strong></h2> <p>We’ve made some great signings, raided the Bundesliga for Frimpong, Wirtz and Ekitiké and swooped south for Kerkez, with more to come. Our target is clear then: to finish top again and go further in Europe. And we must try without one of our stars, Diogo Jota, whose loss is immeasurable, of course to his family first and foremost. What he meant to the boss, the team, each individual player and the supporters has been evident in the outpourings of love and respect shown in these past weeks. We won’t forget him and in doing all we can to succeed we will honour his memory.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>The new signings and how quickly they settle will be vital, but I imagine the influence of Alisson, Van Dijk, Salah and Mac Allister will continue to make the team tick. Weak links can only be in defence if multiple injuries hit at once. The 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha has dazzled in pre-season and I expect he will play a some part, albeit sporadically, and Trey Nyoni continues to look the real deal.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>Isak has four goals in six games against us. It would be good to see him score in a red shirt. We definitely need support at the back, too. We’re supposedly monitoring Guéhi at Palace, who is in his last year of his contract, and Parma’s Giovanni Leoni, 18 – one for seasons to come.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>Arne Slot. His summer Ibiza jaunt was picked up on social media, and he’s becoming ever more demonstrative on the touchline.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>Yes, we’re back with Adidas – the three stripes come with a ton of glorious memories – and it has a traditional feel to it, no fancy detail or frothy, unnecessary collar. A shirt of champions.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>1st. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Liverpool; 2. Manchester City; 3. Arsenal; 4. Chelsea. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. West Ham; 19. Leeds; 20. Burnley. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Scott Parker.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Steph Jones</strong></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Manchester City</strong></h2> <p>I think most people seem to be underrating City going into the new season. Liverpool have obviously done eye-catching business and from a position of strength, too. But City have filled some key holes (such as left-back, central midfield) and bolstered the squad in terms of depth, which was a big problem last season. The target has to be a serious and sustained challenge for the title, plus going deep in the Champions League.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Rodri’s fitness will be fundamental. We’re better placed to cope without him this campaign, but he is obviously brilliant and makes an enormous difference to how we play. We need more from Haaland this season, both in terms of performances and output (as mad as that may sound!). And I’m hopeful that Oscar Bobb should have the breakthrough season injury robbed him of in 2024-25.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>The big hole is undoubtedly right-back. Kyle Walker has moved on and we haven’t replaced him. Tino Livramento was the top target, but it sounds like (potentially for diplomatic/political reasons between the ownership groups) City have opted out of a deal. It seems as if we’re deferring solving that problem until next summer. The big talking point for fans now is who leaves from Akanji/Stones/Kovacic/Gündogan, if anyone.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>With Grealish in the departure lounge, it’ll be Guardiola. Last season was unquestionably his worst at City, his idiosyncrasies coming to the fore. But hopefully he’ll be lifted by the new coaching setup around him. Even the best need their ideas to be challenged.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>Our home and away kits are clean, simple. The less said about the <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/leaked-manchester-city-2025-26-113000413.html">“rain-inspired” third kit</a> the better.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>1st. <strong>Top four </strong>1.

Our new front three scored more league goals between them last season than our entire team managed. But we do still need to replace the keeper and a central midfielder. Amorim has been ruthless in removing players and the negativity that has been hanging over the team, and preseason performances have been promising. I think a top-six finish is achievable. But where we are in the table after the tough opening 10 games will show us whether this group of players have the minerals to dig in and build momentum. Last season we were bullied because we couldn’t handle the physicality.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/09/cunha-and-mbeumo-offer-glimpse-of-uniteds-new-era-but-de-gea-steals-show">Cunha and Mbeumo offer glimpse of United’s new era but old boy De Gea steals show  | Will Unwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>We couldn’t convert the chances we created last season and so the signings of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko were a priority. Onana still feels like a disaster waiting to happen, though: his positional play is poor, he is indecisive and the distribution ability that he was bought for seems nonexistent. Amorim continues to play three at the back and Dalot remains poor as a wing back. On the bright side, Diego León, our 18-year-old left-back, looks like a mini Hulk. I expect him to become a regular.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>If we can get rid of Garnacho, Antony and Sancho to stay onside with PSR, I’d love to see us go for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Sporting’s Morten Hjulmand and PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>Bruno Fernandes. He carried us last season and recently called out the owners, saying we need signings to raise standards.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>They’re all the same. Some bright spark has had “Theatre of Dreams” embroidered into the back. “The Temple of Doom” may be more apt after these opening 10 games.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>6th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Liverpool; 2. Manchester City; 3. Arsenal; 4. Chelsea. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. Sunderland; 19. Wolves; 20. Leeds. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Keith Andrews.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Shaun O’Donnell</strong></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Newcastle</strong></h2> <p>After last season’s heroics we were approaching this season with cautious optimism, tempered by the PSR straitjacket. But the Isak saga has cast a shadow over the summer – and we’ve grown increasingly frustrated by losing out to rivals for transfer targets. A strategy of courting established stars has failed and going into the summer with no director of football, and an outgoing chief executive, couldn’t have helped. It’s astonishing that on the eve of a four-competition season we have ended up with more goalkeepers than senior midfielders. Yet the ace in the pack, Eddie Howe, is still here. We trust him implicitly. As long as we secure reinforcements, a Champions League spot is the aim.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Joelinton, Bruno and Sandro Tonali could go toe-to-toe with anyone in Europe – we’ll need all of their strength, guile and passion to progress. We’re also blessed with two sensational full-backs in Tino Livramento and Lewis Hall, while Lewis Miley remains our brightest young hope. But central defence is a concern. Dan Burn and Fabian Schär have legendary status, but they’re not getting any faster, while the injury-blighted Sven Botman is yet to get back to his best.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>We’ve needed a new striker for at least two seasons (where was the succession plan for Callum Wilson?) and that remains a priority, as does a pacey, younger centre-half: Brighton’s Jan Paul van Hecke could fit that bill. A replacement for Sean Longstaff is required too. Conor Gallagher would be ideal, but PSR will put him out of reach.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>The irrepressible, effervescent boyhood Toon fan Jacob Murphy. He’s a wind-up merchant who plays with a big grin on his face. Top lad!</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>It’s smart. The blue piping is a nice touch. Even better with the Champions League badge.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>5th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Manchester City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Chelsea; 4.

Burnley. <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Graham Potter.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>David and Richard Holmes</strong></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Nottingham Forest</strong></h2> <p>Many Reds fans were worried about the prospects for the season when Elanga was sold and Morgan Gibbs-White looked to be on his way – but Forest’s recent transfer history shows they tend to make signings late on in the summer. Last season showed that we had a decent first XI but not so much strength in depth when it was needed, so with a European campaign coming up (it would be nice to know which competition, though), we will need good reserves for a solid season.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Keeping MGW was a massive statement. Many Forest supporters also love that it cemented our owner and club as Top Six Disruptors™, and lots of journos and fans of rivals don’t like it… The future looks good, too: we have a proud record of always having an academy product in the squad since the 1940s, so Zach Abbott and maybe Jimmy Sinclair could make appearances in Europe and the Carabao Cup.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>A goalie, full-back(s) and a central defensive midfielder. The possibility of former Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz signing from Juventus has been tantalising for the last few weeks, but we’re not the only club who want to bring him back to the Premier League.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>Evangelos Marinakis. Apparently it is his fault that the Crystal Palace and Spurs chairmen cannot do their admin.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>I have mixed feelings about it – I like the shirt, but I’m also old enough to remember Forest getting relegated wearing pinstripes in the inaugural Premier League season …</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>10th. <strong>Top four </strong>1.

We’ve been away from the Premier League for a long time and it’s a completely different beast now. The difference this time is that we have invested properly, we are stable off the pitch, and Le Bris looks like he is building something. Staying up is the obvious target; if we can survive and put down a foundation, anything beyond that is a bonus.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>The player I’m most excited to watch is Chris Rigg. Since breaking into the first team he has only improved, becoming our youngest league scorer. He’s a huge prospect and I think he’ll thrive on this stage. Signing Xhaka is massive as well, not just for his quality but for his leadership. With such a young squad, his voice in the dressing room and on the pitch will be priceless.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>Defensive cover: someone to replace Chris Mepham following the end of his loan and also to provide depth in that area. Our back line carries the biggest injury risks, so I expect a couple of late loans when other clubs finalise their squads. That said, we’ve not just been waiting around for scraps this summer, so there’s no telling who might come in.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>Luke O’Nien has become a cult hero, someone who genuinely understands what it means to love Sunderland. He has already made a name for himself with his interactions with opposition players, so who knows what he will get up to in this league. And Wilson Isidor became a fan favourite last season, most memorably for his celebration against Middlesbrough when he attached his shirt to the corner flag and waved it above his head. Seeing that at St James’s Park would be incredible.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>I love them. Home and away are both top-class from Hummel. The lighthouse on the away, the Bridge Hotel Vaults tile pattern on the keeper kit, and that central crest on the home all feel spot on.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>16th. <strong>Top four </strong>1.

Being optimistic should be the default starting point for every supporter. However, the crowing caveat here is more cock-a-doodle-don’t than do. The target is to avoid a debacle by playing decent football, a sense of that mystical evolution and the avoidance of 22 league defeats. Frankly, I think we’ll be fine.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Cuti Romero is likely to be named captain, meaning it’s a case of collective accountability throughout the squad to galvanise a side that will be having to cope without the legend Son. All our kids are going out on loan; Mikey Moore was the one breaking through last season, but this term he’ll be doing that for Rangers instead.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>What we need every window; the essentials. This summer, that would mean a full-back, a No 10 (as James Maddison is cursed) and a striker. Doing so would prove we want to compete. The reality of it is that we’ll just plod on and see if we can wing it again.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>Son was the last remaining treasure of the Mauricio Pochettino puzzle where all the pieces are now lost for ever. So I may as well nominate Mo Kudus, who will no doubt get a rousing standing ovation on his return to the Olympic Stadium.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>Liking or disliking a kit will ultimately be defined by the football on the pitch because your memories will be tethered to what the players are wearing when they do whatever it is they do. Win another cup and the new kit will be iconic. The black away shirt is delicious either way, though.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>5th. Add a 1 in front of that later in the season. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Liverpool; 2. Manchester City; 3. Arsenal; 4. Chelsea. <strong>Bottom three </strong>18. Burnley; 19. Sunderland; 20. Nottingham Forest. Cheeky bid for Gibbs-White next summer? <strong>First manager sacked</strong> Graham Potter.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Spooky </strong>Original <a href="https://thefightingcock.co.uk/pod/">The Fighting Cock</a> podcaster</p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>West Ham</strong></h2> <p>Despite the sale of Mohammed Kudus I’m fairly optimistic now Potter has had a full pre-season with the squad and a successful US tour. It was always difficult fitting Bowen and Kudus in the same team; hopefully there’s now space for “Jimmy” Summerville to get going. Niclas Füllkrug looks fit and sharp which might make all the difference. If we’re playing wingbacks then much will depend on new signing Diouf, who can certainly whip in a cross, and the excellent Wan-Bissaka.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>Paquetá being found innocent of spot-fixing means we might have back the player of two years ago, while Bowen will, as ever, be crucial. We’ve got to hope that a lot of last season’s signings will improve or stay fit in their second season, such as Füllkrug, Summerville, Kilman and Todibo. The return of Aguerd (he should never have been loaned out) will help at the back. The weak link will be a one-paced central midfield. Potter has a reputation for giving youngsters a chance and Luis Guilherme, Freddie Potts, Callum Marshall, George Earthy and Ollie Scarles might all get games.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>Walker-Peters is a good squad signing but we need more speed and dynamism in midfield as Soucek, Álvarez and Ward-Prowse are not too mobile. Douglas Luiz and Villa’s Rogers have been mentioned, but seem unlikely. We also need a young striker to compete with Füllkrug. The injury-prone Callum Wilson is a great finisher to have on the bench, but at 33 is a short-term gamble.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>Jarrod Bowen is Mr West Ham (and now Mr Dani Dyer), though if you want angry outbursts then Füllkrug has form. I’ll bet on Paquetá doing something exciting too.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>Not sure why we’re sponsored by Susan Boyle Sports. The home kit is OK but should have blue arms. I prefer a white away kit to the new ecru one, but I like the navy third kit with the giant hammers on it.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>10th. <strong>Top four </strong>1. Liverpool; 2.

Significant funds were generated early in the window, raising hopes of a rapid overhaul, but recruitment has come at a trickle so far. Attacking midfielder Fer López has clear potential, wingback David Møller Wolfe can hopefully fill the void left by Aït-Nouri and, by all accounts, forward Jhon Arias is a potential Premier League star in the making. But the squad still looks short in several areas. Survival should be the minimum requirement in what’s now our eighth consecutive top-flight season, but it still feels like the main objective with no meaningful signs of ambition.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links? </strong>We’ve lost a lot of craft, so it’s important we’re solid at the back to compensate. We need Emmanuel Agbadou to continue his fine form from last season and those around him (Toti Gomes, João Gomes and André) to keep the team compact. Further forward, Jorgen Strand Larsen has to fire again and Jhon Arias can hopefully compensate for Cunha’s departure. England u18s winger Mateus Mane made his Premier League debut last season and didn’t look out of place in that brief cameo. He could feature again, especially if the club fails to bulk out the dwindling wide attacking areas.</p> <p><strong>We still need to sign … </strong>I’d like four players – a right wingback, a central midfielder and at least two who can operate across the front three positions. Nearly all of our recruitment comes from Europe and South America so I’ll be surprised if we move for any domestic players. Still, someone like James McAtee or Harvey Elliott would tick a lot of boxes.</p> <p><strong>Our headline-maker is … </strong>The manager has become the identity of the team with his “first the points, then the pints” mantra. On the pitch, Yerson Mosquera is a stellar wind-up merchant, so if he gets minutes expect some shenanigans.</p> <p><strong>Happy with this season’s new kit? </strong>Yes, I will give the club credit for a smart home kit. Probably still a bit yellow for some people’s liking, but the collar is a nice change of pace and I like the understated pattern.</p> <p><strong>We will finish … </strong>16th. <strong>Top four </strong>1.
