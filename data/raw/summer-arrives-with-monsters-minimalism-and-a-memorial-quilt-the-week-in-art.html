The painting, which depicts the young sex worker Rafaëla, who was the artist’s lover, is just one example of Lempicka’s defiance of the subject of the female nude as a historically male artist’s domain. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jun/12/tamara-de-lempicka-rafaela-portrait-sale">Read the story</a>.</p> <h2>What we learned</h2> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/07/i-paint-extreme-emotions-rachel-jones-on-her-riotously-colourful-paintings-and-her-obsession-with-mouths">Painter Rachel Jones hopes her abstract works ‘invite people to speak’</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/08/brussels-celebrates-art-decos-mass-produced-objects-for-the-middle-class">Art deco was the first artistic movement to deliberately appeal beyond the elites</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/09/so-much-joy-show-brings-martin-parrs-low-key-visits-to-bristol-pride-to-light">A new show highlights Martin Parr’s low-key visits to Bristol Pride</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/09/megan-rooney-artist-power-sanders">Megan Rooney explained why she attacks her paintings with power sanders</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/09/yoshitomo-nara-review-hayward-gallery-cutesy">Yoshitomo Nara added sombre reflections on Fukushima to his trademark punk brats</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/09/it-makes-me-sick-how-the-likes-of-the-french-impressionists-went-from-lunatics-to-luminaries">Seen as cosy now, the impressionists were originally considered ‘deranged lunatics’</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/09/gordon-baldwin-obituary">‘Sculptural potter’ Gordon Baldwin has died aged 92</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/10/chicken-wire-mr-darcy-wigans-gaudi-kevin-duffy">The sculptures of ‘Wigan’s Gaudí’ Kevin Duffy are under threat after his death</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/11/made-for-sex-hedonistic-party-palaces-new-york-fire-island-horace-gifford">New York’s ‘queer Xanadu’ Fire Island is home to architectural masterpieces</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jun/11/researchers-create-ai-based-tool-that-restores-age-damaged-artworks-in-hours">AI could be used to restore paintings not valuable enough for traditional approach</a></p> <h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2> <p><strong>The Interior of the Oude Kerk, Amsterdam by Emamuel de Witte, about 1660</strong></p>    <p>There’s a sense of disjunction, of modernity, in this painting of 17th-century Dutch people in a medieval church. The soaring gothic architecture, illuminated by the ever-changing daylight the big windows let in, belongs to another age. The painting self-consciously sees a difference between the medieval past embodied by the enigmatic stone fabric, and the artist’s own new era. The Dutch had fought a long war against Spain for religious freedom as well as national sovereignty, and the way worship and profanity are mixed here – no one minds that a dog is urinating – may suggest the Reformation’s disrespect for clerical power and idolatry. But this is also a painting illuminated by the new scientific spirit of 17th-century Europe. De Witte coolly observes patterns of light and shadow, reflecting the optical discoveries of his time. That rational gaze sees nothing inherently sacred in this old building.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/emanuel-de-witte-the-interior-of-the-oude-kerk-amsterdam">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in Touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
