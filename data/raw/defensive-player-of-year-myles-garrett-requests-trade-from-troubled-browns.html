<p>Myles Garrett, the reigning NFL defensive player of the year, says he wants to be traded by the Cleveland Browns in order to get a realistic shot at winning a championship.</p> <p>“As a kid dreaming of the NFL, all I focused on was the ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl – and that goal fuels me today more than ever,” Garrett <a href="https://x.com/AdamSchefter/status/1886444952579613077">wrote in a statement</a>. “My love for the community of Northeast Ohio and the incredible fanbase of the Cleveland Browns has made this one of the toughest decisions of my life. These past eight years have shaped me into the man that I am today.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/21/deshaun-watson-cleveland-browns-injury-nfl-football">The Browns’ sad and seedy Deshaun Watson era nears its predictable endpoint</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“While I’ve loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won’t allow me to be complacent. The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl. With that in mind, I have a requested to be traded from the Cleveland Browns.”</p> <p>The Browns selected Garrett with the No 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft and he has delivered on his potential, developing into a hugely disruptive force at defensive end who is now the Browns’ all-time leader in sacks. He is also a four-time first-team All Pro, a six-time Pro Bowler and was named defensive player of the year in 2023.</p> <p>However, the Browns have mostly failed to surround him with a capable team. In the eight seasons since Garrett was drafted, the Browns have reached the playoffs just twice, never progressing beyond the divisional round. In his first season the Browns lost all 16 of their games; In 2024, they went 3-14. They have also struggled since awarding quarterback Deshaun Watson a record contract after landing him in a trade with the Houston Texans. Watson’s tenure has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/21/deshaun-watson-cleveland-browns-injury-nfl-football">troubled by poor play</a>, controversies over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/11/browns-deshaun-watson-denies-new-sexual-assault-claim-and-will-play-on-sunday">allegations of sexual assault</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/10/deshaun-watson-achilles-injury-prognosis-will-miss-significant-time-in-2025">a series of injuries</a>.</p> <p>The 29-year-old’s request comes despite Browns general manager Andrew Berry saying he would not consider trading Garrett this offseason. Garrett signed a five-year, $125m contract extension with the Browns in 2020.</p>
