<p>The Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) has rejected accusations of censorship after suspending screenings of a Derek Jarman film following a complaint against the showing of a gay kiss.</p> <p>In a statement, the museum’s director Annie Fletcher said: “We at the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) are dismayed at the current supposition that we would actively censor the work of Derek Jarman and /or any artist from the LGBTQ+ community.”</p> <p>The museum cancelled screenings of Jarman’s experimental 1985 film The Angelic Conversation, which depicts the relationship of two gay male lovers, after a parent raised a complaint in January that it was “harmful” to their five-year-old child.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/ireland-world/article/museum-removes-lm-of-men-kissing-after-parents-complaint-t9p0d3rt9">According to a report in the Sunday Times</a>, the complainant wrote: “Your outdoor screen is displaying close-up footage of topless adults kissing intimately. My five-year-old daughter walks in this space.”</p> <p>The film, which features Judi Dench narrating 14 Shakespeare sonnets, was <a href="https://imma.ie/whats-on/living-canvas-at-imma/">showing on IMMA’s Living Canvas outdoor screen</a> on the front lawn of its Dublin gallery, but was removed from the museum’s programming following the complaint. However, IMMA insisted that they have removed the film briefly out of “an abundance of caution” and that they “would be delighted” to programme the film again. The museum has confirmed it will show the film again in August on the same screen.</p>    <p>In the statement, Fletcher said: “When the complaint was raised, towards the end of the film’s two-week run, we made the decision to pause the screening of this work to seek clarification on the implication of showing a PG-rated film in a public domain to ensure we were not in conflict with any planning or screening legislation for art in a public space.”</p> <p>Fletcher added: “It is regrettable that the event reported on in the Sunday Times has been misconstrued in a rush to judgment.”</p> <p>James Mackay, a close collaborator of Jarman’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/07/standing-stones-urban-hellscapes-and-male-nudes-derek-jarmans-glorious-super-8-short-films">who produced many of his films</a> including The Angelic Conversation says: “Who would have thought that Angelic Conversation, the most tender of Derek’s films, would offend. I know that we live in dark times but, really, two boys kissing with closed lips. Has it come to this?”</p> <p>Responding to the initial complaint, Mary Cremin, IMMA’s head of programming, said the matter would be “reviewed internally” and said the film was certified PG and suitable for public screening.</p> <p>The complaint was then referred to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland who forwarded it on to the Irish Film Classification Office (IFCO). Jarman’s film, only having shown for 10 days of its planned 14-day runtime, was removed from the museum as they awaited “professional opinion”.</p> <p>Fletcher said that “clarification has been attained” and they plan to reinstate screenings of the film, adding: “We would like to assuage the valid disquiet of all our LGBTQ+ community that we shall continue to proudly programme inclusively across our site.”</p> <p>“IMMA has been at the forefront of championing Jarman’s practice, developing the first major retrospective since 1995 and a major accompanying publication. We have also purchased his works for the national collection. We have shown his films and will continue to do so as part of our public programme.”</p>
