Both were excellent, obviously O’Reilly got a goal, and could have had another in the first half. But Matheus Nunes was also excellent on the right, and pocketed Semenyo, which is no mean feat. Considering the amount of money that City have spent on full backs in recent years, it’s a bit of a surprise that Guardiola has settled on two natural midfielders as his first-choice full-backs. But both Matheus Nunes and O’Reilly are fast, powerful, very good on the ball and increasingly impressive defensively. Pep is obviously putting in that work on the training ground. Others like Stones, Ake, Ait-Nouri, Savio and Rico Lewis are having to make do with a place on the bench. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6907a86c8f089c910df359c2" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-02T18:54:52.741Z">6.54pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>It’s a fine line between brave and stupid</strong> in terms of pressing.

Haaland could have had a first-half hat-trick, while O’Reilly also went clean through on goal. Bournemouth improved defensively after half-time but I wonder if Iraola will make mention of that first-half tactical mistake in his post-match interview. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6907a36c8f081a1dc7fc03aa" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-02T18:33:30.048Z">6.33pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Pep Guardiola look like a happy chap</strong> as he chats to Haaland on the post-match lap of the pitch, as they applaud the fans.

That is despite the fact that they lost some of their biggest stars (including three-quarters of their defence) over the summer, a transfer window in which the club made a profit of £63.3m. Relatively unheralded teenagers Eli Kroupi (plucked from Ligue 2) and Veljko Milosavljevic (who made only 27 first-team appearances for Red Star Belgrade before signing for Bournemouth) have come in as thrifty replacements and already look like Premier League superstars.</p> <p>Antoine Semenyo has arguably been the best player in the league this season. Andoni Iraola is a likeable and unflappable manager, playing an entertaining brand of football that is flexible enough to steer clear of tactical evangelism. Unbeaten since August, Bournemouth might have the smallest stadium in the league but have turned the Vitality (11,300 capacity) into a mini fortress. Away from home, the Cherries have been a bit more inconsistent – a win over Tottenham has been supplemented by high-scoring draws against Leeds and Palace – and this is the improvement that Bournemouth must make if they are to truly be considered as genuine top-four or (DON’T SAY IT, DON’T SAY IT, DON’T SAY IT) even title contenders.</p> <p>Manchester City, of course, know what it takes to go the distance, even if this current crop are struggling to live up the treble-winners of yesteryear. Arsenal look imperious at the moment but only a fool would count out Pep Guardiola and co with just a quarter of the season completed. City will go second on 19 points with a win today, six points behind the Gunners. That is not an insurmountable gap, particularly as Arsenal’s next three league games are Sunderland (a), Tottenham (h) and Chelsea (a).</p> <p>Plenty to play for, then, in an intriguing match.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 4.30pm GMT.</p> </div>   </div>
