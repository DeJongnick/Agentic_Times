<h2>Shark! Celebrity Infested Waters</h2> <p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong><strong><br></strong>At the risk of sounding cold-blooded, the fact that no celebrity gets gobbled up by a shark ruins any real jeopardy in this new reality series. Lenny Henry, Lucy Punch and Ross Noble are some of the stars swimming with their new fish friends – the aim being to prove that sharks are misunderstood. But they’re a good bunch and it’s worth rooting for Helen George – who is too scared to even go in the sea with her kids – as she dives straight in with bull sharks. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Michael Mosley: Secrets of the Superagers</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>The beloved media doctor filmed this series before his death last year, and it only adds to his already impressive TV legacy. He met people around the world whose lifestyles seem to defy ageing – starting with 70-year-old skydiver Dane. Does jumping out of a plane improve memory? Mosley investigates. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Human</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong></p>    <p>“We’re just the latest in a long line of other humans,” says paleoanthropologist Ella al-Shamahi, for anyone up for starting the week with an existential crisis. She’s a fantastic guide in this groundbreaking new series about human evolution, which starts by telling us there were once at least six other human species alive at the same time. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>The Couple Next Door</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>Gird your loins: it’s the return of this steamy swinging thriller, with a new couple. Surgeon Charlotte (Annabel Scholey) and her husband Jacob (Sam Palladio) work at the same hospital, and the power struggle is upended when Nordic nurse Mia (Aggy K Adams) joins the operating room … and moves in next door to them. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Billion Dollar Playground</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Three</strong><strong><br></strong>The series offering a dispiriting insight into the very wealthy via the people who serve their needs. Salvatore has stormed off in a huff, leaving an inexperienced team to handle a demanding corporate retreat. As guests arrive by helicopter, the staff are preoccupied by their own squabbling. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>The Gilded Age</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Atlantic<br></strong>Everything seems cushty for relentless manipulator Bertha (Carrie Coon): after much furtive bullying and cajoling, the marriage of her daughter and a hot duke has been formally announced. Only some amusingly soapy dramatic contrivances could possibly stand in Bertha’s way from this point on. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Dog (Channing Tatum, 2022), 7pm, Film4</strong></p>    <p>Channing Tatum could have made any film he wanted for his directorial debut, and it’s telling that he ended up making Dog. On the surface, Dog is a Turner &amp; Hooch rip-off about an army ranger who has to escort his dead friend’s dog across the country to be put down. However, the number of layers Tatum manages to fold in are incredible. There’s comedy, and a surprisingly clear-eyed take on mental health in the military. And you’ll probably cry at the end. So much better than it needed to be. <em>Stuart Heritage</em></p>
