<p>Good afternoon.</p> 
<p>King Charles has initiated a formal process <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/30/prince-andrew-leave-royal-lodge-windsor">to remove “the style, titles and honours” of Prince Andrew</a>. The disgraced royal, who will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, will also move out of his home at the Royal Lodge.</p> 
<p>The decision follows renewed scrutiny on Andrew’s friendship with the late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations of sexual assault against him by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre’s family said that “today, she declares a victory” and that she had “brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage”.</p> 
<p>Robert Booth writes that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/30/not-in-this-together-king-charles-cuts-andrew-loose-to-save-royal-familys-repute">“act of utmost ruthlessness”</a> is the king’s most consequential action since he ascended the throne in 2022.</p>
