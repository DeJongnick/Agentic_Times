<p> When I took on the main role of caring for my dad, I recognised I had become part of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2014/jun/01/sandwich-generation-looking-after-children-ageing-parents">“sandwich generation”</a> but I didn’t imagine that stage in my life would lead to a new career.</p> <p>A GP practice manager for much of my early working life, I had taken a step back to raise my daughter. In 2003, Dad’s health deteriorated, with heart problems and Parkinson’s disease. My siblings helped and visited him when they could but I lived the closest and had more time, so it made sense for me to help out the most. </p> <p>I’d always thought of care as helping people who need to be taken to the toilet or helped into bed each evening. What I was doing was sitting and talking, going to the supermarket or helping with housework. What I didn’t see at that time was the truth in front of me, that I had actually been delivering relationship-led care and companionship. </p> <p>I feel privileged to have spent that time caring for Dad, and in many ways I got to know more about him over those five years than I might otherwise have done. It came completely naturally to me, but in my mind being a care worker was something very different, so after Dad passed away and I felt ready to get back to work, I discounted it.</p> <p>I had a strong CV after my time in the NHS and felt ready for a new role. I felt I had lots to offer, but I was being told different. I went for many interviews but none led to a job offer. </p> <p>Then the real “What’s the point?” moment came. I went for a job as a GP receptionist and, despite 12 years as a practice manager, was told I’d need to retrain in all areas of office work as I was classed as unskilled. My self-esteem and confidence hit rock bottom. I drifted along with a few cleaning jobs, feeling that was how the rest of my working life would pan out. </p>    <p>I felt professionally bruised but my career watershed came when I saw an ad in the local paper looking for care givers to work with seniors. It reignited a spark I’d felt looking after Dad. It made me start to think seriously about a new career path in adult social care.</p> <p>I called and found that <a href="http://www.homeinsteadjobs.co.uk/">Home Instead Senior Care</a> has a values-led recruitment approach: it is looking for people with compassion and empathy – the core character traits to do the job – rather than necessarily looking for previous experience. </p> <p>The fact that I didn’t have qualifications in care wasn’t held against me. Far from feeling like I was on the professional scrapheap, I could see a new future and, despite being 56, had a personal development plan too.</p> <p>I carried over the need to have a spirit of understanding from my healthcare career into the new role. It’s important to build a relationship with clients as everything hinges on that. Some people aren’t ready to accept they need extra help, so I take everything at a pace they’re happy with.</p> <p>I care for six clients, working four days a week. One is centenarian Peggy, who I see on Wednesdays. I help with the morning routine: getting out of bed, bathing, dressing then making breakfast. Peggy loves poetry and I read to her most weeks. Whether it’s Wordsworth, Keats or Pam Ayres, we will often say the words together. She’s remarkable.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/oct/11/recruiting-retaining-care-staff-rewarding">The secret to recruiting and retaining care staff? Rewarding them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everything I do is about giving people the confidence to carry on with what they love, but with the reassurance that someone is there. It may be as simple as standing outside the bathroom door while they bathe, but it’s encouraging them to do things they otherwise wouldn’t have the confidence to do – and it’s about building trust.</p> <p>The best thing about working in the care sector is really getting to know my clients: it’s wonderful to build that relationship and to hear and share in their life stories. The most surprising thing about caregiving with has been the support I’ve received. There are opportunities to progress further and full training is given for everything.This job is the best thing I’ve ever done. It’s given me back professional purpose and I’ve never done anything more rewarding. </p> <p><strong><a href="https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/">Join the Social Care Network</a> for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.
