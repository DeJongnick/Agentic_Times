  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Russian president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> said on Thursday that new US sanctions were an attempt to put pressure on Russia, adding that they would not affect the Russian economy, state news agency RIA reported. </strong>He said that Moscow’s response to strikes deep into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> will be very serious and overwhelming, adding that Russia would never bow to pressure from abroad.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>President <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> said on Thursday that Ukraine should be able to use Russia’s frozen assets for domestic weapons production and to purchase European and US weapons. </strong>He went on to say that discussion with European leaders today had been good but emphasised that using the money from frozen Russian assets was not simple.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy also said that land swaps with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> are “not acceptable” when asked whether he felt US president Donald Trump would change his mind on the issue again. </strong>He said that any money should be used on weapons, not just humanitarian aid, for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The US has announced new sanctions against Russia’s two largest oil companies, signalling a major shift in Donald Trump’s approach to ending the war in Ukraine.</strong> The measures <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/us-sanctions-russia-oil-vladimir-putin-refusal-ukraine-war">taken against Rosneft and Lukoil</a> mark the first time the US has sanctioned Russia since Trump’s return to office in January.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>China said Thursday it opposes recent sanctions slapped by the US on the two largest Russian oil companies over Moscow’s war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, saying they had “no basis in international law”.</strong> China, a major Russian trading partner, has said it takes a neutral stance on the war and has refrained from condemning Moscow’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Kyiv’s forces struck Russia’s Ryazan oil refinery overnight, Ukraine’s general staff said on Thursday.</strong> The attack caused a massive fire at the plant critical for Russian military supplies, it said on Telegram. Ukrainian drones also hit an ammunition depot in Belgorod region, according to the general staff.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russian engineers have reconnected the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to external electrical power from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, ending a month-long emergency that had plunged the future of the six-reactor site into doubt. </strong>Ukrainian sources told the Guardian that Russian technicians had hoped to connect Europe’s biggest nuclear plant – which had been relying on backup generators since its last external power line was cut in September – to power from the Russian grid on 7 October as a birthday present for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Moscow has handed over the bodies of 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers and has received 31 bodies of its own fallen soldiers in return, Russian RBC news outlet reported on Thursday.</strong> “Repatriation measures took place today. One thousand bodies, which according to the Russian side belong to Ukrainian servicemen, were returned to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>,” Ukraine’s agency responsible for prisoners of war said on social media.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A Russian drone killed two Ukrainian journalists in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, their news outlet confirmed to AFP on Thursday.</strong> Freedom TV, a state-funded news organisation, confirmed initial reports of the attack published by the Donetsk regional governor, who posted images of the charred remains of the reporters’ car.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu">European Union</a> on Thursday imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on the head of a top Moscow university who earlier this year started a master’s course on how to circumvent EU sanctions, the EU’s official journal showed. </strong>The EU measures against Nikita Anisimov, the rector of the National Research University Higher School of Economics, are part of a much wider, 19th package of sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> in 2022.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Six men have appeared for sentencing on Thursday over their involvement in an attempt to burn down a London building in a Russian spy plot. </strong>In October 2024, the ringleaders, Dylan James Earl and Jake Reeves, pleaded guilty to breaching the National Security Act and aggravated arson, after an attack on two industrial units in Leyton in March 2024 belonging to businesses with links to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A network linked to Russian spies enlisted British companies to unwittingly help build president Putin’s Arctic submarine defences for nearly a decade, a Times investigation has found.</strong> The findings have emerged from Russian Secrets, an investigation by The Times, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and 11 other outlets.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Thousands of Hungarians congregated on the streets of Budapest in a show of force on behalf of their prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who looks set to face the most competitive ballot in his 15 years in power at parliamentary elections in April. </strong>The gathering, dubbed a “peace march” by organisers, came on Hungary’s 23 October national holiday, a remembrance of a failed anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 that was crushed by the Red Army, AP reports.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Britain’s King Charles and Pope Leo prayed together in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel on Thursday, in the first joint worship including a head of the Church of England and a Catholic pontiff since King Henry VIII broke away from Rome in 1534.</strong> Latin chants and English prayers echoed through the chapel, where Leo was elected the first US pope by the world’s Catholic cardinals six months ago.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Spanish authorities on Thursday said they had found the body of a 56-year-old man who died after being swept away in floods in the eastern Valencia region last year, the country’s deadliest such disaster in decades. </strong>DNA analysis confirmed that a corpse found on Tuesday in the Turia river belonged to one of three people reported missing since the 29 October 2024 tragedy that killed more than 230 people, a Valencia court said in a statement.</p></li>

  <p>Ukraine’s government has allocated $200 million (£150 million) in emergency aid to the state-owned energy firm Naftogaz for gas imports amid Russian attacks on the Ukrainian gas sector, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>Russia has sharply increased the number and intensity of attacks on the Ukrainian energy system in recent weeks, targeting both power plants and gas facilities.</p>

  <p>The World Trade Organization backed the European Union on Thursday in the latest chapter in its case against Colombia over import duties imposed on frozen fries from Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.</p> 
  <p>The EU won the case in December 2022, with the arbitrators faulting Colombia for the way it calculated the tariffs, and determining the duties breached global trade rules.</p> 
  <p>But the EU asked a WTO compliance panel last year to re-examine the case, charging that Colombia had failed to implement the initial decision.</p> 
  <p>In its report published Thursday, that panel found that Colombia had indeed failed to fully comply with the earlier ruling, potentially opening the door for Brussels to win the right to retaliate.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Viktor Orban accuses EU of wanting to impose 'puppet' government in Hungary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Thursday accused the European Union of wanting to impose a “puppet” government on Hungary and presented next year’s election as a choice between peace or going to war to “die for Ukraine.” </p> 
  <p>“This is why they want to squeeze Ukraine into the EU at any price...to bring war into Europe, and take money to Ukraine,” Orban told a rally in front of parliament in Budapest.</p> 
  <p>Orban, who has opposed the EU’s policy of providing military aid to Kyiv, has long cast Ukraine as a threat to Hungarians, saying its potential EU membership would destroy agriculture and put Hungarian jobs and even pensions at risk. He reiterated his stance on Thursday, saying Ukraine must not be allowed to join the bloc. </p>

  <p>The STOXX 600 index closed at a record high on Thursday, led by gains in energy stocks after the US imposed new sanctions on Russia, while investors also gauged the health of corporate Europe from a batch of earnings reports.</p> 
  <p>The continent-wide benchmark index ended 0.37% higher at 574.43 points.</p> 
  <p>Energy stocks gained 2.7% and marked their strongest session since mid-April as crude prices soared 5% after the US slapped sanctions on major Russian suppliers over Moscow’s intensifying war with Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>“On the face of it, the announcement of sanctions by the US on Rosneft and Lukoil is a major escalation in the targeting of Russias energy sector and could be a big enough shock to flip the global oil market into a deficit next year,” said David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics.</p> 
  <p>“That said, the lasting impact on the oil market and oil prices will depend on how long any sanctions remain in place, and how effectively they are enforced.”</p>

  <p><strong>Russian engineers have reconnected the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to external electrical power from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, ending a month-long emergency that had plunged the future of the six-reactor site into doubt.</strong></p> 
  <p>Ukrainian sources told the Guardian that Russian technicians had hoped to connect Europe’s biggest nuclear plant – which had been relying on backup generators since its last external power line was cut in September – to power from the Russian grid on 7 October as a birthday present for Vladimir Putin.</p> 
  <p>But the effort was foiled by Ukrainian partisans, who attacked substations behind the lines in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, damaging a newly completed high-voltage connection that ran from the plant to Mariupol and the Russian grid.</p> 
  <p>As a result, the sources said, Russia had little choice but to repair a 750-kilovolt line that runs from the plant – controlled by Russia since March 2022 – across the Dnipro River and the frontlines into Ukrainian-held territory to restore the supply of external electricity.</p> 
  <p>Similar comments were made earlier this month by Volodymyr Omelchenko, an energy expert at Ukraine’s Razumkov Centre thinktank, in an <a href="https://espreso.tv/ekonomika-rosiyani-khotili-na-7-zhovtnya-zrobiti-podarunok-putinu-u-viglyadi-zaporizkoi-aes-pidklyuchenoi-do-rosiyskoi-energosistemi-ekspert-omelchenko#goog_rewarded">interview with Ukraine’s Espresso TV</a>.

  <p>On 7 October, Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-appointed governor of the occupied Zaporzhzhia region, reported power cuts across “all settlements” in the area after what he described as a terrorist attack by enemy drones.</p> 
  <p>Prior to its reconnection, the nuclear power plant had been relying on backup diesel generators to supply electricity necessary for cooling for a period well beyond the standard three-day safety limit, after the 750kv line was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/27/safety-fears-as-external-power-to-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-still-out-after-three-days">cut on 23 September</a>.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A network linked to Russian spies enlisted British companies to unwittingly help build President Putin’s Arctic submarine defences for nearly a decade, a Times investigation has found.</p> 
  <p>The findings have emerged from Russian Secrets, an investigation by The Times, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and 11 other outlets. </p> 
  <p>The procurement network circumvented sanctions and export controls to purchase more than €50m worth of sensitive underwater technology and research vessels from Europe, the United States, Canada and Japan between 2014 and 2024, according to leaked documents.</p> 
  <p>It bought more than £1m worth of hi-tech British-made components such as sensors and remotely operated vehicles that helped build the Russian early warning system that detects Nato submarines in the Arctic Ocean and protect Russia’s nuclear weapons. </p> 
  <p>Among the British equipment sold was an unmanned vehicle used to survey and lay cables and a state-of-the-art sound sensor suitable for “hydrographic survey operations”.</p> 
  <p>There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the British companies.</p> 
  <p>The revelations have prompted calls for the Department of Business and Trade (DBT) to ensure that the UK’s sanctions regime can counter attempts to circumvent it.</p>

  <p>All three men were arrested on suspicion of assisting a foreign intelligence service, contrary to section 3 of the National Security Act (NSA), 2023 and they were taken to a police station in London.</p> 
  <p>The country to which the alleged offences relate is Russia.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Ukraine: EU proposal for using frozen Russian assets 'fully legal and fair'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Ukrainian president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong>, urged European Union leaders on Thursday to agree as soon as possible on a plan to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy, who is visiting Brussels, said on X that the proposed mechanism for using frozen Russian assets was entirely legal and fair. He said Ukraine would use a significant part of the assets to buy weapons from its European allies.</p> 
  <p>Belgium has been the most vocal sceptic of the plan, as it fears the move could open up the country to costly legal challenges from Russia. The prime minister, <strong>Bart De Wever</strong>, has insisted that to move ahead Belgium needs firm guarantees from all other EU states that they will share the liability if Moscow comes calling. He also wants other countries in the bloc to promise to start tapping Russian assets frozen in their territories.</p> 
  <p>“Then we could go forward,” he said at the start of the EU summit. “If not, I will do everything in my power at the European level, also at the national level, politically and legally, to stop this decision.”</p> 
  <p>Despite the Belgian hang-ups, EU leaders are expected to give the go-ahead at the summit for the European Commission to draw up a formal legal proposal for the loan.</p> 
  <p>EU officials say they hope to have a detailed proposal ready next month and be able to finalise the loan by the end of the year. But there looks set to still be wrangling over the small print, with lawyers poised to go through it with a fine-tooth comb.</p> 
  <p>One key sticking point could be the conditions for how the funds can eventually be spent by Kyiv. France is insisting that the bulk of the funds goes to buying weapons from in Europe, as it seeks to bolster the EU’s defence industry.</p> 
  <p>The commission has backed that argument for now but other member states insist the focus should be on allowing Kyiv to get what it needs to fight Moscow, wherever it comes from.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Britain’s <strong>King Charles</strong> and <strong>Pope Leo</strong> prayed together in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel on Thursday, in the first joint worship including a head of the Church of England and a Catholic pontiff since King Henry VIII broke away from Rome in 1534.</p> 
  <p>Latin chants and English prayers echoed through the chapel, where Leo was elected the first US pope by the world’s Catholic cardinals six months ago.</p> 
  <p>Charles, supreme governor of the Church of England, was seated at the pope’s left near the altar of the chapel as Leo and Anglican Archbishop Stephen Cottrell led a service that featured the Sistine Chapel Choir and two royal choirs.</p> 
  <p>Although Charles has met the last three popes, and Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI travelled to Britain, their previous encounters never included joint prayers.</p> 
  <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla, who visited the Vatican earlier this year to see Pope Francis, also had a private meeting with Leo on Thursday morning.</p> 
  <p>At home in Britain, Charles’s disgraced brother Prince Andrew is engulfed in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/21/mps-move-to-lodge-parliamentary-motion-to-strip-prince-andrew-of-dukedom">deepening crisis</a> over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-abuse-epstein-maxwell">abuse allegations</a> and his ties with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p> 
  <p>King Charles will travel in the afternoon to Rome’s Basilica of St Paul Outside the Walls, one of Catholicism’s four most venerated churches, where Leo has approved giving him a new title of “Royal Confrater”, or brother, at the connected abbey.</p> 
  <p>Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday that Charles had also approved two British honours for Leo: making him the “Papal Confrater” of St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle and conferring on him the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The US has announced new sanctions against Russia’s two largest oil companies, signalling a major shift in Donald Trump’s approach to ending the war in Ukraine. The measures <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/us-sanctions-russia-oil-vladimir-putin-refusal-ukraine-war">taken against Rosneft and Lukoil</a> mark the first time the US has sanctioned Russia since Trump’s return to office in January.</p> 
  <p>The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said the sanctions were needed because of “Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war” and that the companies targeted were responsible for funding the Kremlin’s “war machine”. He said that the US was also prepared to take further action.</p> 
  <p>Trump has called the sanctions “tremendous”, but experts remain split on how effective they will be in slowing Russia’s war and bringing Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table – with many saying it will come down to how aggressively the US enforces them.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>What has been announced?</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The sanctions announced by the Treasury will see all assets belonging to Rosneft and Lukoil in the US frozen, while at the same time US companies and individuals will be barred from doing business with them. The measures also include sanctions against dozens of subsidiaries of the companies.</p> 
  <p>The US is also threatening secondary sanctions on foreign financial institutions that do business with Rosneft and Lukoil – which could include banks that facilitate sales of Russian oil in China, India and Turkey.</p> 
  <p>Rosneft and Lukoil are the two largest oil companies in Russia and account for nearly half of Russia’s crude oil exports, according to Bloomberg. Both companies were sanctioned by the UK last week, and on Thursday the EU will also announce a raft of new sanctions against Russia.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>Why now?</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump claimed he would end the Ukraine war “in 24 hours” if elected.<strong> </strong>But since returning to the White House, he has found the task more difficult than he envisioned. His commitment to the war has flip flopped – from stating last month that Ukraine could <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/trump-ukraine-land-lost-russia-nato-oil-imports-un-speech">regain all the land lost</a> since the 2022 invasion, to this week suggesting the country’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/20/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-donbas-region-end-russia-invasion">Donbas region should be carved up</a> in a way that would leave most of it under Russian control.</p> 
  <p>This week, Trump abruptly pulled out of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/21/plans-for-trump-putin-talks-in-budapest-shelved">planned second summit with Putin</a>, amid reports his administration was frustrated by preconditions set for the meeting by the Russian side. By Wednesday, his impatience was evident, as he told “every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere.”</p> 
  <p>Trump has been resisting pressure from allies in Congress to impose further sanctions, but Russia’s unwillingness to shift its position – along with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/this-is-europe-coalition-of-the-willing-reparations-loan">sustained lobbying from European</a> – appears to have changed his calculations.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Russia vows 'painful response' if EU confiscates assets</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Any action by the EU to confiscate Russian assets in Euroclear accounts will result in a “painful response” from Russia, the foreign ministry spokesperson <strong>Maria Zakharova</strong> said on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>“The EU has no legal means to seize Russian assets, so their confiscation would be ‘theft,’” Zakharova said.</p> 
  <p>A proposal by the European Commission to use Russian assets frozen in Europe to provide a €140bn (£122bn) “reparation loan” to Ukraine will be discussed on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>Under the plan, the EU would use cash balances from frozen Russian central bank securities to give Kyiv support that would cover much of its funding needs for 2026 and 2027.</p> 
  <p>But what do countries within the 27-member bloc think?</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Belgian</strong> prime minister, <strong>Bart De Wever</strong>, has said he would oppose the measure until he secured guarantees on the use of Russian immobilised assets.</p> 
  <p>De Wever, whose country is home to chief asset holder Euroclear, said he did not see the legal basis for such a decision yet, adding that immobilised assets had not even been touched in the second world war.</p> 
  <p><strong>German</strong> chancellor <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong> said on Thursday: “I share the Belgian prime minister’s concerns but am confident we will take a step forward.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Finland’s</strong> prime minister <strong>Petteri Orpo</strong> said: “We have a solution on the table which is legally sustainable and takes Belgium’s concerns into account.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Sweden’s</strong> prime minister, <strong>Ulf Kristersson</strong>, said: “I won’t declare victory on this until we’re done but I see a very broad support for using frozen Russian assets.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>China said Thursday it opposes recent sanctions slapped by the US on the two largest Russian oil companies over Moscow’s war in Ukraine, saying they had “no basis in international law”.</p> 
  <p>China, a major Russian trading partner, has said it takes a neutral stance on the war and has refrained from condemning Moscow’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Asked about the new US sanctions at a daily press conference in Beijing, the foreign ministry spokesperson <strong>Guo Jiakun</strong> said “China consistently opposes unilateral sanctions that have no basis in international law and are not authorised by the UN security council”.</p> 
  <p>In response to another question about Trump’s statement that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, could have a “big influence” on Putin in efforts to end the war, Guo said that “dialogue and negotiations are the only feasible way out of the Ukraine crisis”.</p> 
  <p>At the same press conference, Guo criticised sanctions on Russia agreed Wednesday by the EU whose targets included Chinese companies, saying Beijing was “strongly dissatisfied”.</p> 
  <p>“China is neither the creator of the Ukraine crisis nor a party to it,” he said. “The European side is in no position to make irresponsible remarks about the normal exchanges and cooperation between Chinese and Russian enterprises.”</p> 
  <p>Guo urged Brussels to “stop making an issue out of China”, vowing that Beijing “will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests”.</p>

  <p><strong>European leaders are meeting on Thursday with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Brussels to reaffirm support for Kyiv</strong>. The president of the European Council, António Costa, welcomed Zelenskyy, addressing him as “future member of the European Union”. The meeting comes as the <strong>27 member bloc formally adopted a 19th package of sanctions against Russia</strong> for its war against Ukraine that includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports. The Danish rotating presidency of the EU said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s a significant package that targets main Russian revenue streams through new energy, financial, and trade measures.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>In a major policy shift, Donald Trump on </strong><strong>Wednesday imposed sanctions on Russia’s two biggest oil firms</strong>. New restrictions have been unveiled against Rosneft and Lukoil – as well as dozens of subsidiaries – because of “Russia’s lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine”.</p> 
  <p>Trump said to reporters that he has a “very good relationship” with his Russian counterpart, but felt he had to cancel their planned meeting in Budapest as “it didn’t feel right to me”. In a sign of growing frustration, he told reporters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I cancelled it. But we’ll do it in the future … I have good conversations. And then, they don’t go anywhere. They just don’t go anywhere.</p>

  <p>He also hinted that the sanctions could be lifted if the Russian president was prepared to cooperate in peace talks.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the United States and the European Union on Thursday for agreeing on new energy sanctions against Russia, saying they were “very important”</strong>. He also told reporters in Brussels that a ceasefire was possible in Russia’s war on Ukraine but that yet more pressure would be needed on Moscow to make it happen. He ruled out making any territorial concessions to Russia.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A proposal by the European Commission to use Russian assets frozen in Europe to provide a €140</strong><strong>bn (</strong><strong>£122bn) “reparation loan” to Ukraine will be discussed on Thursday</strong>. Under the plan, the EU would use cash balances from frozen Russian central bank securities to give Kyiv support that would cover much of its funding needs for 2026 and 2027. “I won’t declare victory on this until we’re done but I see a very broad support for using frozen Russian assets,” the Swedish prime minister, <strong>Ulf Kristersson</strong>, said at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>However, the Belgian prime minister, Bart De Wever, laid out three demands on</strong><strong> the use of Russian immobilised assets to provide</strong><strong> a loan to Ukraine, adding he would oppose that measure until he secured guarantees</strong>. De Wever, whose country is home to chief asset holder Euroclear, said he did not see the legal basis for such a decision yet, adding that immobilised assets had not even been touched in the second world war. He said: “We are the only ones, Euroclear is the only financial institution that offers the windfall profits to Ukraine. We know that there are vast amounts of Russian money in other countries who have always been silent about this.<br>“If these three demands, which I think are quite reasonable, are met then we can go forward. If not, I will do everything in my power at the European level, also at the national level, politically and legally to stop this decision.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>EU countries will on Thursday agree on filling the financial needs of Ukraine in 2026 and 2027, the E</strong><strong>uropean Council </strong><strong>president, António Costa, said</strong>. ““The technicality of the solutions, we continue to work on with the European Commission, but the most important is the political decision,” Costa said before a summit of EU leaders in Brussels.</p></li>

   <li><p><strong>Engineers have repaired a damaged high-voltage line and restored external power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine, </strong>its Russian-installed management said on Thursday. The plant – Europe’s largest, with six reactors – was seized by Russian troops in the first weeks of Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. It currently produces no electricity, but needs external power to ensure that fuel in the reactors remains cool and no meltdown occurs. Until Thursday, the plant had been without power for 30 days, relying on backup diesel generators.</p></li>
