  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>One thing I am worried about … is how can you have an open debate about all of those things if there’s too much of a climate of fear within our party and the way the party is being run?</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Criticising a situation where “a party member is suspended for liking a tweet by another political party, or a member of parliament loses the whip for trying to protect disability benefits”, Burnham received repeated rounds of applause from the audience. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If that is the way we’re doing things, where debate is being closed down, that to me is what we’ve got to change.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Burnham also spoke out against demands for “simplistic statements of loyalty”, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If that closes down the debate we need, I think it’s at risk of underestimating the peril the party is in as we get to the polls next May.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Miliband does not know if Farage racist, but says Starmer right to say Reform UK's policy racist</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Helena Horton is a Guardian environment reporter.</em></p> 
  <p>At the LCEF (Labour Climate and Environment Forum) fringe, <strong>Ed Miliband</strong> declined to say Nigel Farage was a racist. “I don’t know what he is,” said Miliband. But he insisted that Keir Starmer was right to describe Reform UK’s immigration policy as racist.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>[Keir] is right to call out a racist policy because the idea that Farage comes along and says, get rid of indefinite leave to remain, breaking up families who’ve been here for decades, you know, sending Ukrainians who come to this country, fleeing Russian persecution. That is a racist policy against people who are born abroad, and it’s absolutely right to call it out.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>On Donald Trump calling climate change a hoax, Miliband said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We were elected by the British people with a mandate from the British people, and we’re going to carry on with our mandate whatever Trump says.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said Reform was sticking up for “the frackers who want to frack our country” and added that the opposition to net zero had come from “massive economic interests”.</p> 
  <p>When asked if he was disheartened by the rise of Reform, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Well, what’s the fucking point of politics? I lost the election in 2015 right? I could have gone away. But the point of politics is about ideals. The point of politics is to go out and argue your case, and you let the chips fall where they may, and maybe you win, and maybe you don’t, but I think we are gonna win! The point of it all is you believe in things, you go out and argue for things. You win the argument.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked about Andy Burnham, and his leadership ambitions, Miliband said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I am Keir’s guy. If you are asking a leadership question, I am Keir’s guy.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said Burnham is “a very talented guy and we should use all the talents we’ve got”.</p> 
  <p>About running again himself, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I don’t know how many times I can say no, I definitely will not.</p>

  <p><em>Political correspondent</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Lisa Nandy</strong> has said Labour is “battling for the soul of the country” as she accused Reform UK of deliberately targeting Britain’s shared cultural institutions to sow division.</p> 
  <p>The culture secretary told activists that Keir Starmer was “absolutely right” to frame politics as a fight for national identity, recalling how her own father faced racism when he arrived from India in the 1950s. “We all know what discrimination and prejudice looks like,” she said.</p> 
  <p>Nandy insisted British cultural institutions such as the BBC, sport, and national celebrations were under attack from the right because they remain some of the few spaces that unite the country.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There’s a reason Reform are using some of the best things our country has had … they’re trying to turn them into potent sources of division.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She warned that the last 15 years of political turmoil had left the country vulnerable, but insisted Labour had to reclaim symbols such as the flag and national sport as emblems of unity.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Nothing we’ve ever achieved was ever done alone. Brilliant, bold, diverse, that is the country we celebrate when we stand together.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Nandy, the first Labour cabinet minister of Indian heritage, said she was determined not to be the last. “Every generation has a responsibility to fight for the country we believe in,” she said. “Stand together, fight together, and friends we will win together.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Reform UK part of 'global network of far right', linked to billionaires, says Ed Miliband</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Helena Horton is a Guardian environment reporter.</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Ed Miliband</strong>, the energy secretary, speaking in conversation at an LCEF event, in conversation with journalist Lewis Goodall, is being asked about why people are so unhappy with Labour at the moment.</p> 
  <p>Miliband said Labour needs to take the fight to Reform UK and said they are part of a “global network of the far right” which needs to be challenged.</p> 
  <p>He went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s important to draw the contrast here, because it’s not just that [Nigel] Farage wants less workers’ rights and all those things. Even though he poses as something else, he is now part of a global network of the right, a global network of billionaires like Elon Musk who want to take away people’s rights, take away people’s freedoms, and we need to have that argument. </p> 
   <p>And I think if we frame the argument as who will really stand up to the working people of this country, who will change a broken economy so it works for the working people in this country, us or Reform, I think the answer is us, and I think we can win that argument. I am actually confident that we can do that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Miliband went on to argue that two Tory ideas were to blame for the fact Britain was “hurting”: trickle-down economics and austerity, which dominated for three of the past four decades, he said. He argued it was hard to turn that around.</p> 
  <p>He also that Farage had the wrong diagnosis of the country’s problems, blaming “immigration, net zero and whatever else”. </p> 
  <p>Labour needs to say “that is not our view about why the country is in difficulties, and saying it plainly”, Miliband said. He said Keir Starmer did that today, and would be doing that again in his speech on Tuesday.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Plaid Cymru and Reform UK both offering 'divisive nationalism - different poison, same bottle', says Welsh FM Eluned Morgan</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Polling in Wales <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/17/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-king-charles-windsor-politics-latest-news-updates-labour-keir-starmer?page=with%3Ablock-68cad1db8f088854dcd6a2d6#block-68cad1db8f088854dcd6a2d6">suggests </a>that Plaid Cymru and Reform UK will be the two biggest parties in the Senedd after next year’s elections. For the first time since devolution, Wales is likely to have a non-Labour first minister.</p> 
  <p>In her speech to the Labour conference, <strong>Eluned Morgan</strong>, the Welsh first minister, described Plaid and Reform as “different poison, same bottle” and predicted “chaos” if one of them were to win.</p> 
  <p>She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Let’s be brutally honest, the polls are not looking good. People are angry. They’re disillusioned.</p> 
   <p>Our voice, the voice that’s always fought for them, is getting drowned out by the carnival of charlatans and the circus of snake oil salesmen.</p> 
   <p>Now Reform blames foreigners, Plaid blame Westminster – divisive nationalism in different forms. Different poison, same bottle – all with answers that sound brilliant until you ask how: They can’t tell you.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Morgan may regret this comment if, after the elections next year, Welsh Labour ends up trying to negotiate a coalition deal with Plaid, as seems quite possible.</p> 
  <p>Morgan went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Wales doesn’t need fantasy politics. Mark my words, Wales will fall into chaos if either Plaid or Reform wins in May. What we need is experience and stability in an age of instability, and that’s what Welsh Labour can offer.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Ukip, the first insurgent party launched by Nigel Farage, did quite well in elections in Wales nine years ago. Morgan said the group broke up in chaos.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ve seen this play before in Wales.</p> 
   <p>Nigel Farage’s Ukip party elected seven members in 2016 and by the end of the term, six of them had left, drawn by infighting, broken promises and internal chaos.</p> 
   <p>And just this week, their former Welsh leader admitted taking Russian bribes.</p> 
   <p>And right now they’re attacking our support for Ukrainian refugees.</p> 
   <p>This lot are … not putting Wales first. They’re putting Putin first.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Jo Stevens</strong>, the Welsh secretary, was also damning about Reform in her speech. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Farage has turned up in Wales with patronising politics, with disrespect, division and derision for our communities.</p> 
   <p>Reform UK don’t care about Wales. They haven’t got any Welsh policies. They haven’t got a Welsh leader. They can’t even spell Caerphilly right.</p> 
   <p>But as much as we roll our eyes at their condescending nativist tone, they are a serious threat.</p> 
   <p>They’re a threat to our communities, a threat to our NHS and, if you work in Welsh public services, they are a threat to your livelihood.</p>

  <p><em>Environment reporter</em></p> 
  <p>Labour needs to up its messaging on the climate crisis and the need for clean energy or it will cede ground to Reform UK, the chair of the Commons energy committee has said.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on a More In Common panel on solar power, <strong>Bill Esterson</strong> warned:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I just want to start by talking about the climate threat, because it’s increasingly struck me that we talk about the clean power agenda, we talk about what we’re doing in energy, but we don’t talk as much as we used to [about the climate threat]. I feel that’s perhaps why those who are peddling misinformation and returning to outright climate denial are having traction.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Michael Shanks</strong>, energy minister and Ed Miliband’s right-hand man in the department, said they would make their messaging clearer. He told the panel:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>While we’ll talk a lot about the energy security arguments and about jobs, and we’re bringing down bills, we will double down as a government on being very clear that tackling the climate crisis is a priority for us now, not a future threat, but a very present reality.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said that his goal of decarbonising the electricity grid by 2030 was “really difficult” but “absolutely still achievable” and added there will be upcoming legislation from his department on planning reform to get infrastructure projects built.</p> 
  <p><strong>Esterson</strong> added the public have a “high degree of impatience” about bills not going down, and added: “We’ve got to get on getting the message out that we deliver.”</p> 
  <p>He said the energy department is doing a good job of getting the message out but said “the whole of government needs to be doing that too”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">What commentators are saying about Starmer's BBC interview, and describing Reform UK's immigration policy as racist</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Here is some more comments on Keir Starmer’s BBC interview this morning, and his decision to call Reform UK’s immigration policy racist.</p> 
  <p>Commentators on the left are generally enthusiastic.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrjamesob.bsky.social/post/3lzv55jzgr226">From</a> the LBC presenter <strong>James O’Brien</strong></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is good (for once). Farage has to stay front &amp; centre for almost 4 more years &amp; I don’t see how he can without edging ever closer to the National Front credo that’s always animated him. For now, Starmer must wait until he’s *blatantly* racist before using the term. Otherwise it loses power 1/2</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A thing to watch for, discourse-wise, is racism-deniers &amp; facilitators in ‘mainstream’ media trying to detoxify ideas that have been beyond the mainstream pale since the Eighties. The Liddles &amp; Littlejohns openly relish the opportunity that Farage offers them to remove what’s left of their masks.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atulhatwal.bsky.social/post/3lzv6shjzts2j">From</a> <strong>Atul Hatwal</strong>, editor of the Labour Uncut website</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I thought the Friday Starmer speech was inadequate in terms of meeting the moment. Felt like it was drafted to respond to the Robinson march, basically ignored Reform’s mass deportation plan. Much better this morning, finally called it right ‘racist and immoral’</p>

  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jdportes.bsky.social/post/3lzv4x6ajss2f">From</a> <strong>Jonathan Portes</strong>, an economics professor and immigration specialist</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Exactly the right language and tone from Starmer here -no nonsense about “legitimate concerns” or weasel words about cost/practicality. Now government needs to put his money where the PM’s mouth is (in policy terms)</p>

  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adambienkov.bsky.social">From</a> <strong>Adam Bienkov</strong> from Byline Times</p>

   <p>The Prime Minister’s condemnation of Nigel Farage’s racist and immoral mass deportation plans has come far too late for many in his party</p> 
   <p>james O’brien bluesky</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/paulmasonnews/status/1972314493813432404">From</a> <strong>Paul Mason</strong>, the broadcaster, writer and campaigner</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is probably Starmer‘s finest statement of principle since he’s been PM - the creeps outside shouting about Fabianism need to be defeated, not appeased</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But <strong>Fraser Nelson</strong>, the former Spectator editor who now writes a column for the Times and a Substack blog, argues that Starmer has made a mistake. He recently made a documentary for Channel 4 about Reform UK, and it included an interview with Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who fought off a threat from the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency (helped by a young Morgan McSweeney, now the PM’s chief of staff). Nelson says Hodge gave him a quote explaining why Starmer may have made an error. On in <a href="https://frasernelson.substack.com/p/who-thinks-reform-is-racist">a post on his Substack</a> he says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I interviewed [Hodge] for the film, and we didn’t get to use much of it. Which is a shame because she made some very interesting points on the r-bomb [calling someone racist]. [<strong>Hodge</strong> said:] <em>“Throughout that whole four-year period of campaigning against the BNP, I never called anybody a racist. The moment you do, you belittle their concerns about the impact of immigration on their community and unfairness coming into the system (as to who got a council home and who didn’t). If I had accused them of being racist, I would simply have driven them even further into the BNP camp because they would have felt offended that I didn’t really understand their concerns.” …</em></p> 
   <p>This dynamic - that a challenger party is strengthened when attacked by a larger rival - is important. It is a dial that can be moved by the challenger: you trigger them. Say or do something to get them talking about you: preferably in hyperbolic tones. This is the basic art of populist war, which Donald Trump mastered because the Democrats rose to the bait every time. This explains the effect of shock-tactics in election campaigns - Farage’s HIV/immigrant line in 2017, his Sunak/D-Day line in 2024 and his Sarwar/Pakistani line in Hamilton. Yes, condemnation comes, but with it, attention. And if you’re attacked for making a point that most voters agree with, it’s a net plus.</p> 
   <p>So dropping the r-bomb may be gratifying for Farage’s opponents to use. It may rally the base in the week of a conference. But as Baroness Hodge says, doing so when there is no grounds for it risks diminish you - and bolstering your opponent. It could well be that Reform’s opponents keep playing into its hands.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Scotland being held back by 'tired and out of touch SNP', Sarwar says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>While most speakers at the Labour conference have singled out Reform UK for special criticism today, <strong>Douglas Alexander</strong>, the Scottish secretary, and <strong>Anas Sarwar</strong>, the Scottish Labour leader were also withering about the SNP.</p> 
  <p>In his speech <strong>Alexander</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The SNP, as a nationalist party, is dedicated to making Scotland independent - everyone understands that.</p> 
   <p>But the harsh truth is that if you wake up every morning thinking: “What can I do today to move Scotland closer to independence?” that means you start the day focussed on difference, division and grievance. </p> 
   <p>In today’s world of political, economic and technological turmoil that approach is letting Scotland down. </p> 
   <p>Now is the time to focus on building not breaking, on cooperation not conflict, on working together not pulling apart.</p> 
   <p>We need and deserve a first minister fully committed to solidarity and not separation to ensure Scotland’s aspirations are backed by the UK’s strength.</p> 
   <p>That’s is why the next first minister has to be someone who will put the people of Scotland first.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>And this is what <strong>Sarwar</strong> said about the SNP.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>In Scotland we are being held back by a tired and out of touch SNP government.</p> 
   <p>Look at the contrast.</p> 
   <p>In England under Labour, NHS waiting lists are falling.</p> 
   <p>In Scotland under the SNP they are still rising - with 1 in 6 Scots on an NHS waiting list.</p> 
   <p>Here patients are being seen quicker. But not in Scotland.</p> 
   <p>Do you know that there are more people waiting over two years on an NHS waiting list in Glasgow alone than in the whole of England?</p> 
   <p>Here schools are now recovering after a decade and a half of Tory misrule. While under the SNP ours are falling down the international league tables.</p> 
   <p>Here the Labour government is getting spades in the ground to build new homes, while in Scotland the SNP are failing to deal with a national housing emergency.</p> 
   <p>A UK Labour government is returning neighbourhood policing to local communities.</p> 
   <p>But in Scotland, under the SNP, police numbers are cut and our police stations are closing.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Rowena Mason is the Guardian’s Whitehall editor.</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Alan Milburn</strong>, the lead non-executive director at the Department of Health and former Labour cabinet minister, had a stark warning about the state of public services at a Tony Blair Institute fringe meeting.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The truth is unless we get upstream of some of these issues – family breakdown, knife crime, divisions in communities and, frankly, health – then the system will just be overwhelmed. The state will be overwhelmed. You can see it already. The law of supply and demand isn’t working.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said Donald Trump was right that the west would need to spend more on defence and meanwhile the NHS, social care and infrastructure and other public services had increasing demands.</p> 
  <p>He said there is a “limit to how much you can tax and how much you can borrow … and it is not even about the bond market, it’s about people”.</p> 
  <p>Milburn said the current situation was “not sustainable” and solving it would require a “mindset change” to shift towards spending money on prevention of problems before they get acute.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Attorney general Lord Hermer rejects suggestions he is blocking attempts to stop ECHR being misused</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Political correspondent</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Lord Hermer</strong>, the attorney general, has pushed back against claims from colleagues that he is standing in the way of reforming Britain’s human rights framework, insisting that “good lawyers are not blockers, they are enablers.”</p> 
  <p>Speaking at a fringe event at Labour conference, Hermer said he looked forward to working with the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, to “transform” the asylum and immigration system, promising a “world-class litigation strategy” that would scrutinise every stage of the process “from caseworker decisions through to supreme court cases”.</p> 
  <p>He added that the role of lawyers in government was not to dictate policy but to “help [ministers] make the decisions as effectively as they possibly can”, remarks that appear aimed at quelling unease among Labour MPs who believe he should go further on reform of the European convention on human rights (ECHR). Labour has so far ruled out withdrawal from the convention but signalled it wants to be “at the table” in shaping reforms to how it is applied, particularly in asylum cases.</p> 
  <p>Hermer said many of the problems lay not in Strasbourg, where the European court of human rights is based, but in the UK. He described himself as “completely shocked” to find that Home Office officials did not always attend first-tier tribunals or counter medical evidence presented by applicants.</p> 
  <p>He argued that failures in casework and appeals had fuelled misconceptions about human rights law, citing <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/article/nigel-farage-tears-over-echr-rule-albanian-criminal-deport-chicken-nuggets-5HjczCG_2/">the chicken nugget story</a>, a widely misrepresented ECHR case, as “completely false”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Anas Sarwar suggests Starmer should 'stop being shy' of promoting UK government's successes</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Scotland editor</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Anas Sarwar,</strong> the Scottish Labour leader, has challenged Keir Starmer and party strategists to “stop being shy” of the UK government’s successes, implying that without a dramatically bolder sales pitch Labour faces obliteration in next year’s Holyrood elections.</p> 
  <p>In a speech peppered with direct attacks on John Swinney, leader of the “knackered” Scottish National party leader, and “poisonous” Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, Sarwar directly his main message internally.</p> 
  <p>He repeatedly chided Labour for being too shy on boasting about its achievements – appearing to echo growing concerns within the party and the cabinet Starmer is failing to construct a coherent story about Labour’s policies.</p> 
  <p>With Scottish Labour has surprised its critics by winning several key byelections, its popularity as measured by opinion polls has plummeted, in line with the UK party’s steep decline.</p> 
  <p>The latest Norstat poll for the Sunday Times Scotland underscored growing anxiety in Sarwar’s party, by placing Labour third behind reform in a Holyrood constituency vote, at 17% to Reform’s 20%. The SNP are comfortably in the lead at 34%.</p> 
  <p>Despite the byelection wins, many of Sarwar’s allies fear those findings demonstrate Labour is in deep trouble. Sarwar is seen as being increasingly equivocal about whether he believes Starmer is the right Labour leader.</p> 
  <p>Sarwar used the word “shy” eight times in his speech, as he drummed home his appeal.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Conference, since getting rid of the Tories last summer, we have begun the work of clearing up their mess, and changing this country for the better.</p> 
   <p>But let’s be honest, it’s not been easy. It was never going to be. That’s why we need to be more confident in telling our Labour story.</p> 
   <p>We can’t expect the right-wing press to do our jobs for us. We can’t afford to be shy about the successes we have had.</p> 
   <p>Or about the positive changes we are making. If we aren’t going to talk about our successes – then no one else will. If we aren’t going to tell our positive story, then people aren’t going to hear it.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Anthony Albanese says Labor in Australia has shown patriotism can by 'truly progressive force'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, the Australian PM and Labor party leader, gave a speech that did not directly refer to Keir Starmer’s leadership difficulties (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/28/labour-conference-keir-starmer-latest-uk-politics-news-live-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d8e7c58f084553ecf45c90#block-68d8e7c58f084553ecf45c90">8.59am</a>), but which seemed intended to be as supportive as possible in the circumstances. Speaking as someone who has already won two general elections, he was able to so so with some authority.</p> 
  <p>Here are the main points he made.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Albanese said that his party had shown the patriotism could be a “truly progressive force”. </strong>He said:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>[The labour movement should] should build cohesion and respect and harmony at home. We do that by embracing patriotism as a truly progressive force, by demonstrating that our love of country is what drives us to serve, and also to change it for the better.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This is now Starmer’s core argument. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/28/labour-conference-keir-starmer-latest-uk-politics-news-live-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d900c18f081f77e6af4acb#block-68d900c18f081f77e6af4acb">11.23pm</a>.)</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Albanese said governments could not deliver progress immediately. </strong>He said:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>For Labour governments, every single day counts because it takes time to turn promises into progress.</p> 
   <p>It takes time for plans to work and be seen to work. For inflation to fall, wages to rise, new homes to be finished, new energy connected, new hospitals to open, new investments in education to flow into results.</p> 
   <p>It takes time to tackle problems that have been created over decades. It takes time to repay trust by delivering on commitments, and in doing so, build trust for future action.</p> 
   <p>It takes time to make change with people and make change work for people, and none of that means we can expect or ask for patience.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But Albanese recognised that governments have to be able to respond to some problems immediately.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The challenges that the world throws at us, from economic turmoil to threats to our national security, never wait, and the action that we need to take on climate change, the work we need to do to seize the jobs and opportunities of clean energy, that cannot wait.</p> 
   <p>So while governments always need to be able to tell the difference between what’s urgent and what’s important, in the end, we have to do both.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In his BBC interview this morning <strong>Starmer</strong> said he wanted to be judged by what he achieved over five years. (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/28/labour-conference-keir-starmer-latest-uk-politics-news-live-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d8f4768f084553ecf45cc7#block-68d8f4768f084553ecf45cc7"> 10am</a>.)</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Albanese said that Labor was able to win re-election in Australia because it delivered economic improvement and rising wages in its first term. </strong>This is exactly what Starmer is trying to do. Albanese said:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We didn’t pretend that we had solved every problem in just three years, but we could point to an economy that was turning the corner, inflation down, wages up, unemployment low, and interest rates starting to fall, and we offered a second term agenda that built on the patient and disciplined work we had done in our first term.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>He said that, if delegates got angry at conference, it was a sign they were taking politics seriously. </strong>He said:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The debates that we hold here are not just healthy, they’re essential. They’re a sign of life.</p> 
   <p>The reason passions run high at our conferences is because we really care, because the stakes are really high, because what happens here really matters.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>There has not been much dissent on the conference floor yet – although there was an argument this morning about<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/19/labour-rules-against-dozens-of-motions-about-palestine-being-debated-at-party-conference"> why some Gaza motions have been disallowed</a>.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>And he also paid personal tribute to Starmer.</strong></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We all know this is a time when trust in governments and institutions is under challenge.</p> 
   <p>We all sense this is an era where our capacity for peaceful disagreement is being tested.</p> 
   <p>But what I see here in UK Labour, and this man, this leader, this prime minister, my friend, is the same determination that I know lives in every member of the Australian Labor party, an absolute resolve to stand together and defend democracy itself.</p>

   <p>Starmer was right this week to name [Reform] as the enemy. He’s right today to say they’re racist. We were wrong about the last month or so to say “that won’t work. Their proposals won’t work. They’re a gimmick.” Their proposals are morally wrong.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>McTernan added that Starmer needs to keep making a strong argument against Reform up to the next election. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s wrong for them to say, if you’ve chosen to live in our country and work in the country, that you can have your indefinite leave to remain ripped away from you. This is a generational battle, and I trust in the British people, but this party wins when it’s united.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But<strong> Thangam Debonnaire</strong>, Labour peer and former MP who lost her Bristol seat to the Greens, said that the party could no longer rely on people of colour to vote for them and needs to stand up against racism. Referring to Shabana Mahmood’s comments in an interview published today about ILF (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/28/labour-conference-keir-starmer-latest-uk-politics-news-live-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d8d55a8f084553ecf45c3d#block-68d8d55a8f084553ecf45c3d">8.39am</a>), Debonnaire said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>For many generations, the Labour party has always banked on the votes of people of colour. That is no longer true.</p> 
   <p>And one of the reasons we can’t be banked is some of the people who are going to be affected by what was announced this morning from us on indefinite leave to remain. [The proposals] affect us in particular, and they affect us in very particular ways. And even if the rules end up not quite affecting us all, it feels like that’s where the arrow is being shot.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Bella Sankey</strong>, leader of Brighton and Hove Town Council, also on the panel agreed that Labour needs to keep speaking strongly against racist, far-right comments. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>As a mixed heritage person, it’s very clear to me that the party needs to call out proactively and consistently the racism of our opponents. I was pleased to see the prime minister do it this morning. Reform is a racist party.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said that mainstream Conservatives were also now making racial, far-right comments and that that had to be “called out” too.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Labour has announced that serving and former members of the armed forces will get priority for some homes build on surplus Ministry of Defence land.</p> 
  <p><strong>John Healey</strong>, the defence secretary, will mention the pledge in his conference speech tomorrow, but the party has announced details this morning, confirming a Telegraph story.</p> 
  <p><strong>Labour</strong> says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The move will see a presumption for armed forces personnel and veterans to receive priority access through ‘first dibs’ on new homes built on surplus MoD land. It will also see high quality new service family accommodation (SFA) for serving personnel to rent, as Labour works to ‘stop the rot’ of poor military housing and turn around years of falling military morale under the Tories.</p> 
   <p>The measures would apply to a proportion of new homes on selected sites, agreed between MoD, the local authority and the developer based on demand and site viability.<br><br>The ‘Forces First’ proposals form part of the upcoming defence housing strategy which will deliver a generational renewal of armed forces housing, while supporting a drive to supercharge housebuilding on surplus defence land, delivering high quality affordable homes for working families across Britain. The defence secretary has identified the long-term potential for over 100,000 homes on repurposed Defence land.</p> 
   <p>A trailblazer for this approach is already underway at MOD Feltham in south-west London, where the MOD, the London Borough of Hounslow and the GLA have agreed to adopt a ‘Forces First’ approach as part of a groundbreaking partnership to develop the site. Once vacated, this new development alone is expected to deliver hundreds of homes and jobs. Under the new approach, the aim will be for a portion of the homes to have first priority for military personnel or veterans, including some of the intermediate affordable housing built on site.</p>

   <p>It’s an incredibly important moment for the 97, for Liverpool, but most of all, for the whole country. And conference, we must recognise that it was an unacceptably long and hard fight for the campaigners, for the families and victims of Hillsborough to get us to this point.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer's BBC interview - snap verdict</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The script has changed. For the last year, as Nigel Farage and Reform UK did all they could to ramp up public concern about illegal immgration, and immigration generally, Labour has been hestitant about taking them on. It has been willing to criticise Farage on technicalities, but nervous about making a principled argument against Reform. In some ways this was similar to Labour finding it impossible to say that Brexit was a mistake – because it does not want to alienate the voters who supported it. But in that case Starmer is supressing a view he holds strongly. (He knows Brexit has been a disaster.) On immigration, he genuinely believes that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/26/keir-starmer-digital-id-cards-immigration-borders-reform-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-68d65b528f081ea00e4faa38#block-68d65b528f081ea00e4faa38">some of the concerns of the public are legitimate</a>. As a consequence, as Farage grabbed the headlines day after day over the summer with immigration-linked scaremongering and policy announcements, Labour had almost nothing to say. Rather, what it did have to say was summed up by the parody slogan: “Nigel is right, but don’t vote for him.”</p> 
  <p>This timidity infuriated a lot of progressive voters, and is part of the reason why so many Labour members despair of Starmer’s leadership. (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/28/labour-conference-keir-starmer-latest-uk-politics-news-live-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d8e7c58f084553ecf45c90#block-68d8e7c58f084553ecf45c90"> 8.59am</a>.)</p> 
  <p>Today Starmer adopted a new line, which will probably do a lot to shore up his position in his party. To what extend the electorate at large will notice remains to be seen.</p> 
  <p>Given that Labour were criticising Farage last week, and are criticising him again today, it might feel like nothing much has changed. But the terms of the criticism have changed in three important way.</p> 
  <p>First, Starmer was making a principle, moral objection to Reform UK’s plans to rescind indefinite to remain (ILR) status from people who currently have been told that they have the right to remain in this country for as long as they want. This is quite different from the position last week when Labour was criticising the plans not for being morally wrong, but for being unworkable.</p> 
  <p>Second, Starmer was even willing to call the plans racist. Normally politicians are wary of applying that term to their opponents, because it can be sound as if they are accusing all their opponents’ supporters of being racist too. Today Starmer seemed to think it was justified, and worth the risk.</p> 
  <p>And, third, Starmer linked this to an argument about patriotism. Normally Farage relishes being called “racist” by liberals, because he can argue that this just shows they are out of touch with the “people”. But today Starmer was able to innocuate himself against that by arguing that Farage would “tear our country apart” (which the Reform ILF policy arguably would, if it led to hundreds of thousands of people who have been established in the UK for many year – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/22/reform-labour-keir-starmer-nigel-farage-immigration-latest-uk-politics-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d173d28f083f6c486d7adc#block-68d173d28f083f6c486d7adc">people like nurses </a>– being forced to leave). And the fact that Farage in the past has spoken approvingly of Vladimir Putin, and that one of his former allies has<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/26/reform-uk-ex-leader-wales-nathan-gill-pleads-guilty-bribery-charges"> just pleaded guilty </a>to making pro-Russian statements in the European parliament in return for bribes, makes denouncing Reform as anti-patriotic much easier.</p> 
  <p>The polling probably stiffened Starmer’s resolve before he spoke out this morning. Yesterday YouGov published figures showing that, although voters are split almost 50/50 on the Reform plan to end the ILR status, by 2 to 1 they think it is unfair to do this retrospectively.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Kuenssberg</strong> ended her interview by asking about Andy Burnham, and the leadership.</p> 
  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> said Burnham was doing a very good job as mayor of Greater Manchester.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: He is not the only person raising comments about your leadership.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer denies putting donkey field he bought for his parents into trust, after report claims he did, with potential tax benefits</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Kuenssberg</strong> asked Starmer about <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/keir-starmer-donkey-field-inheritance-tax-trust-jcczlgmsz">this story in the Sunday Times</a>. It says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Sir Keir Starmer gave land to his parents via a trust that meant their estates would never pay inheritance tax on the asset whatever its eventual value, according to legal experts.</p> 
   <p>The prime minister’s decision to place a seven-acre field within the structure meant its value was excluded from his parents’ estate, of which he was a beneficiary, when they died.</p> 
   <p>At the time, <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/keir-starmer">Starmer</a> could not have known whether the estate would end up avoiding the tax and, if so, by how much. This is because any payment depended on the total wealth his parents left behind and the tax-free allowance available to the estate at the time.</p> 
   <p>He insists the trust made no difference to the liability and that he gave them the land solely to help them. Yet No 10 repeatedly declined to say why he could not have simply given them the land, or kept it while permitting them to use it.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> said the story was wrong. He did not put the field into a trust. He said he bought a field for his parents because they loved donkeys, his mother was very ill, and towards the end of her life she enjoyed being able to look at the donkeys in the field next to their house. It cost him £20,000, he said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Manifesto stands', Starmer says, when asked he remains committed to election commitment not to raise VAT</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Kuenssberg</strong> is now asking about tax.</p> 
  <p>She repeatedly asks if he will rule out raising VAT.</p> 
  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> ignores the question several times.</p> 
  <p>Then he says he cannot discuss the budget.</p> 
  <p><strong>Kuenssberg</strong> says in the past he has been willing to say that manifesto commitments not to raise income tax, employee national insurance or VAT still apply.</p> 
  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> just replies: “The manifesto stands.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Kuenssberg</strong> asks him to clarify what that means. It could just mean it stands today, she says.</p> 
  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> says Labour put the manifesto to the electorate, it was elected, and it stands. He is not going into the detail of the budget.</p> 
  <p>This line, ‘‘the manifesto stands”, is new wording. It is hard to tell from this exchange whether Starmer is saying this because the budget will involve some shift on VAT that might breach the promise, or whether he has just chosen a new way of saying he will stick to the commitments.</p> 
  <p>One policy that would be an arguable breach of the commitment would be not raising the main rate of VAT, but extending the scope of it, so that items now coverered by a zero rate or a lower rate have to pay a higher rate. Last week the Institute for Government thinktank <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/24/labour-tories-conservatives-reform-uk-politics-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d40f958f0892d6aebaae5f#block-68d40f958f0892d6aebaae5f">proposed this</a>.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We put that manifesto before the electorate. We got elected and that manifesto stands.</p> 
   <p>I’m not going to go through the details of what may be in the budget.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>More than half of Labour party members want a new leader before the general election, a new poll suggests.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://labourlist.org/2025/09/labour-poll-conference-leadership-survation/">Survation poll</a>, commissioned by the website LabourList, found that 53% of members said the party should get a new leader before the general election, and only 31% said Keir Starmer should stay in place.</p> 
  <p>The same poll found that 64% of Labour members said they thought Starmer had governed badly since entering office.</p> 
  <p>And it found that 65% of them think the party is heading in the wrong direction.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://labourlist.org/2025/09/labour-poll-conference-leadership-survation/">Commenting on the poll</a>, which surveyed 1,254 LabourList readers who say they are party members, <strong>Emma Burnell</strong>, the LabourList editor, said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The phrase ‘make or break conference speech’ is wildly overused in politics. So much so, that you try to reach for other things to say.</p> 
   <p>But the plain truth is Starmer has to do an awful lot this week to convince his party he has a plan to turn things around and the capability to achieve a revival of Labour’s fortunes.</p> 
   <p>Labour members will need to see a plan for change that goes beyond a slogan. But they will also be looking for a passionate messenger who can sell that plan to the country. It’s a tall ask, but one Starmer knows he must deliver on.</p>

  <p>Although the Sunday Times got an interview with Keir Starmer, there was more news in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/36850728/shabana-mahmood-immigration-home-office/">Sun on Sunday’s interview with </a><strong><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/36850728/shabana-mahmood-immigration-home-office/">Shabana Mahmood</a></strong><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/36850728/shabana-mahmood-immigration-home-office/">.</a> Here are the main lines. Mahmood was speaking to the paper’s political editor, Kate Ferguson.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Mahmood said that she wanted to impose new conditions on migrants who want indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in the UK, requiring them to show that they are making a contribution to communities.</strong> She told the paper:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I am looking at how to make sure that settlement in our country - long term settlement, indefinite leave to remain - is linked not just to the job you are doing, the salary you get, the taxes you pay, [but] also the wider contribution you are making to our communities.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said she was inspired by the example of her parents, who came to Birminghan fom Kashmir in the 1960s and 1970s. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They didn’t just come to work - they settled, they made a contribution to the local community, they were volunteers, they got involved in local politics. They did more than simply work and earn a salary.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Last week Reform UK announced that it wants <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/22/reform-labour-keir-starmer-nigel-farage-immigration-latest-uk-politics-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d0f25c8f0816a4522bf934#block-68d0f25c8f0816a4522bf934">to abolish the ILR status altogether</a>. Mahmood is not proposing that.</p> 
  <p>But the government has already said it wants to extend the amount of time migrants normally have to wait until they can apply for ILR, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/14/foreign-workers-uk-wait-permanent-settlement">from five years to 10 years. </a>And, in some respects, Mahmood’s proposals in the Sun in Sunday echo <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/06/kemi-badenoch-tory-staff-immigration-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-67a4bc8f8f08f9d49510d47f#block-67a4bc8f8f08f9d49510d47f">the plans announced by Kemi Badenoch earlier this year</a>. Badenoch also said people should have to wait 10 years before they can claim ILR, and she said it should only be given to people who are net contributors to the state, and that people who have claimed benefits should not qualify.</p> 
  <p>As Patrick Maguire reported in the Times last week, in Labour circles <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/23/lib-dem-ed-davey-conference-donald-trump-keir-starmer-labour-reform-tory-latest-politics-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d277ee8f088949e62b2329#block-68d277ee8f088949e62b2329">“contribution” is now fashionable</a> as an idea that could be applied to public service reform. Mahmood’s interview reflects this thinking.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Mahmood said that the European convention on human rights and refugee conventions were being “used in a way that was never intended” and said she would propose reforms before Christmas. </strong>The Home Office is working on new guidance to the courts on how they should interprete two of the articles in the convention.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Mahmood said the policy of putting migrants in hotels had been a “total disaster for the country”.</strong></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>She said her “jaw hit the floor” when she learned last week about the Home Office spending £600 on a taxi journey for a migrant with a GP appointment a long way from the hotel where they were staying. </strong>She ordered a review after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/24/labour-tories-conservatives-reform-uk-politics-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d3ddb48f08af03abbe6ed3#block-68d3ddb48f08af03abbe6ed3">a BBC investigation highlighted this.</a></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>She suggested that some of those who have been putting up St George’s flags or union jack flags around the country have the wrong motives. </strong>Asked about flags, she said:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I love the St George’s flag and I love the Union Jack. They are flags that I see myself reflected in.And where our flags are being used as a symbol of unity I’m all for it. I would like to see more of our flags actually on our civic institutions …</p> 
   <p>I think the thing that we have to be careful about is the motives of some - not all - but some of the people that are putting up the flags. They are speaking to nationalism. And I’m a patriot, not a nationalist.</p> 
   <p>In my vision of patriotism, you can be English in this country and have 1,000 years of history here, or you can be English and look like me. And no one, not Tommy Robinson or anybody else can take my English identity away from me.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Mahmood was referring to concerns that some of those who have been putting up flags are anti-migrant, or racist.</p> 
  <p>Other ministers asked about flags have declined to accept there is anything negative about the flag-flying trend.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Mahmood said that Margaret Thatcher was one of her political heroes.</strong> In a quickfire question round, asked to name her heroes, Mahmood said:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I have two women who I look up to for their strength and their steel, and that’s Benazir Bhutto and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/margaret-thatcher/">Margaret Thatcher</a>.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Mahmood probably won’t be using this line in her speech to the conference.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer calls on Labour to stop ‘navel-gazing’ and join ‘fight of our times’ as Labour conference begins</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning. The Labour party’s four-day annual conference starts this morning in Liverpool and the headline on the Sunday Times splash sums up the challenge facing <strong>Keir Starmer</strong>: can he pull things round?</p> 
  <p>In party politics terms, what that means is: can Labour recover its lead in the polls? At least, can it do that in time for the next general election? And, in practice that means, can Labour see of the threat from Reform UK. “I think we can pull this round,” Starmer told the Sunday Times, in <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/keir-starmer-interview-labour-party-conference-6wk3d5wm8">an interview with its political editor</a>, Caroline Wheeler.</p> 
  <p>The next four days won’t settle this question. Sometimes political parties get a modest boost in the polls after their party conference, but Labour are about 10 points behind Reform in polls at the moment and no one is expecting them to close that gap this week. But Labour members will be looking for evidence that that party is on the right track. In particular, there are three problems Starmer needs to address. First, he is accused of being a lousy communicator. Will we see any evidence that he is raising his game? Second, he is accused of being not even sure what he wants to communicate in the first place. Commentators, and even some Labour MPs, say they are not clear about the government’s guiding mission. Will we get clarity on that? And, third, voters want clear evidence that Labour is bringing about meaningful change. Will we get policy that ticks that box?</p> 
  <p>Over the last few weeks some Labour MPs have been talking privately about the benefits of getting a new leader. In his Sunday Times interview, Starmer said the party had to abandon this sort of “navel-gazing”. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is the fight of our times and we’ve all got to be in it together. We don’t have time for introspection, we don’t have time for navel-gazing. You’ll always get a bit of that at a Labour party conference, but that is not going to solve the problems that face this country.</p> 
   <p>Once you appreciate the change — in the sense of the division that Reform would bring to our country and the shattering of what we are as a patriotic country — then you realise this is a fight which in the end is bigger than the Labour party.</p>

I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word.</p> 
  <p>If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/13/the-guardian-no-longer-post-on-x-twitter-elon-musk">given up posting from its official accounts on X</a>, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary.</p> 
  <p>I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.</p>
