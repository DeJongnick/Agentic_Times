<p>Does the world need another Jane Austen adaptation, on top of the mountains of TV dramas, stage shows and movies already in existence? Probably not. Even so, this new audio version of Pride &amp; Prejudice, made to mark the 250th anniversary of Austen’s birth, is a proper treat. Instead of a straightforward narration, Audible has thrown its considerable resources at an all-star dramatisation, adapted with skill and sensitivity by Lulu Raczka.</p> <p>Marianne Jean-Baptiste plays the voluble Mrs Bennet, who is keen to get her five daughters married off, if only the longsuffering Mr Bennet (Bill Nighy) would see the urgency of the situation. New on the scene are eligible singletons Mr Bingley (Toheeb Jimoh) and his monosyllabic friend Mr Darcy (Harris Dickinson). Darcy’s air of disdain irks the outspoken Elizabeth Bennet (Marisa Abela) and leads to some heated misunderstandings concerning the rakish Mr Wickham (Will Poulter) and Darcy’s imposing aunt, Lady Catherine (Glenn Close).</p> <p>The narrative here is pacier than the novel, but Austen’s sharp plotting and comic precision remain. Headphones are a must to enjoy the immersive soundscaping, which captures the rustle of a newspaper, the clatter of shoes on stairs and the whispered asides of the Bennet sisters at social gatherings as they cast an eye over the assembled bachelors. A minor gripe: the music, by Morgan Kibby, is lovely, but occasionally it threatens to swamp the dialogue. Nonetheless, this is an engaging adaptation that manages to make this well-known story feel remarkably fresh.</p> <h2>Further listening</h2> <p><strong>The History Gossip</strong><em><br>Katie Kennedy, WF Howes, 4hr 25min<br></em>An irreverent gallop through pivotal moments in history, tackling such vital questions as: was Anne of Cleves a minger?
