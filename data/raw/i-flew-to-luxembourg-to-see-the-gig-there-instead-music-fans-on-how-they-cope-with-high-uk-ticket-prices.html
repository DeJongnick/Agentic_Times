<p>“Live music is my passion, but over the last couple of years, prices have gone crazy,” says Amy Law, 35, a New Zealander living in London. “I used to go to gigs weekly, but I haven’t been since June.”</p> <p>Amy, an EDM fan, says it used to be quite normal for her to pay £15 to £20 to watch a DJ at Electric Brixton before the Covid pandemic. “This week I decided against seeing Lost Frequencies there because it was over £50. Fifty! I’m gutted because he’s my favourite DJ at the moment. It’s a shame because gigs are such a wonderful communal experience and an outlet for life’s frustration. We’re missing out.”</p> <p>Seeing live music is becoming increasingly expensive across the UK, thanks in part to the cost of living crisis, as well as the rise of resale websites and some artists and promoters deploying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/01/oasis-tickets-dynamic-pricing-live-music">dynamic ticket pricing</a>. It’s leading some fans to rethink their gig-going habits.</p> <p>“I go a lot less frequently these days,” says Amy. “We’re especially getting ripped off in London. I was keen to see Lorde at the O2 in November, but I couldn’t justify it.”</p> <p>Amy has taken matters into her own hands and has booked a flight to Luxembourg to see Lorde play a show there for €50 (£43.62). “The flights were about £18 each way. With accommodation, it does put it over the London ticket – but I’m seeing a whole new country for that amount of money.”</p> <p>Mark Rushton, 65, from Bury, says the extra fees that come with larger gigs have put him off going to see shows in Manchester. “It’s the outrageous prices, plus booking fees and car parks. There are bigger venues than ever, yet limited availability. I can’t take my daughter to some shows as it can be hundreds of pounds for a night out.”</p> <p>Rushton points at Ticketmaster for “enabling” high fees, and the company has recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/25/ticketmaster-advertises-tickets-oasis-cma">agreed to change its sales tactics</a> after outraged Oasis fans complained about its handling of the band’s 2025 tour. At the behest of the Competition and Markets Authority, Ticketmaster must now give fans notice if there are going to be multiple prices for the same kind of ticket, and give them more information about ticket pricing while they are in online queues. . (Ticketmaster told the Guardian in a statement: “In a highly competitive UK market, Ticketmaster’s fees have remained largely unchanged – averaging around 11% – for nearly a decade. These fees power the technology, security, and customer support that enable millions of fans to safely discover, buy, and enjoy live events each year.”)</p>    <p>“As the prices have risen, and as Ticketmaster has become the biggest platform, I’ve cut down on gigs,” says Rushton. “I saw Bruce Springsteen at the Co-op Live in May. I picked my ticket up off [ticket resale site] Twickets for £150, which was reduced, because I made an offer on it – but you still get the transaction fees. In 1981, I saw him at the Apollo in Manchester for £6.50” – about £25 today.</p> <p>Nathan Maddison, 57, a finance technician from Newcastle, says he is cutting back on larger gigs – which is a big deal for him as a rock and metal fan. “I turned down an opportunity to see Iron Maiden in June, as financially it was just not doable,” he says.</p> <p>“I will travel to gigs, but you’ve got to factor in the transport and accommodation costs.” These have become more costly, too: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2025/oct/13/most-of-great-britains-major-rail-operators-are-back-in-public-hands-is-it-working">since the 2010s, rail fares have risen faster than wages</a> in the UK.</p> <p>Elaine, 48, from London, says she has recently become a “one and done” gig goer. “These outrageous ticket prices have stopped me going to see someone I’ve seen before that I like, such as Lady Gaga recently.</p> <p>She says the prices of food and drink in big venues “also makes you feel ripped off. It’s taken the fun out of going to see music live.”</p> <p>Elaine has decided to see bands at smaller venues from now on. “I did have the pleasure recently of watching a fantastic gig by Brandi Carlile at Heaven in London which was only £24 a ticket. It was a wonderful night out discovering her music, at a decent price.”</p> <p>Mark Woollard, 51, a facilities manager from London, says he has also embraced smaller gigs in the last few years. “I’m choosing to spend the money on up and coming artists. It’s been great to experience truly intimate gigs in grassroots venues. The tickets are £16 or £17. You often end up meeting the artists themselves selling their merch after their performances, which is another lovely aspect.</p>    <p>“My recent favourites are Prima Queen, Honeyglaze and Coming Up Roses. I’ve also seen reunion gigs – not the Oasis tour, but smaller bands doing their 20-year album revisit.”</p> <p>Mark’s new approach has broadened his musical horizons. “I’m actually seeing more shows,” he says. “I’ve always been interested in finding new artists, but in the last couple of years I’ve actively gone out and hunted down these little gigs.”</p> <p>• This article was updated on Tuesday 28 October to clarify changes to Ticketmaster’s sales tactics.</p>
