<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/florida-panthers">Florida Panthers</a>–<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tampa-bay-lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> rivalry was once a regional sideshow, a quirky matchup between two southern expansion teams playing to half-empty arenas and polite indifference. But in the space of just a few years it has mutated into the nastiest, most revealing feud in hockey: one that’s exposed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nhl">NHL</a>’s double standards, cronyism and cultural divide.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/07/the-nhl-preached-inclusion-so-why-has-it-got-into-bed-with-donald-trump">The NHL preached inclusion. So why has it got into bed with Donald Trump?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Preseason hockey is meaningless by design, a handful of perfunctory tune-ups that even hardcore fans barely notice in the run-up to opening night, when the games finally start to count. Yet in the past week the Panthers and Lightning turned a pair of exhibition contests into three-hour fever dreams of violence: 114 penalties totaling nearly 500 minutes in the box, 16 game misconducts and one ejected player <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz3leKQAKrw">who somehow picked up an assist</a> on an eighth goal that shouldn’t have counted. It was all-out bedlam before the season even began, but the uneven fallout has raised uncomfortable questions around the sport.</p> <p>It all kicked off last Thursday when Florida’s AJ Greer <a href="https://x.com/BR_OpenIce/status/1974134134835720645">sucker-punched Tampa’s Brandon Hagel</a> in the head – a callback to last spring’s playoff meeting between the teams, when <a href="https://x.com/BR_OpenIce/status/1915572068848197887">Hagel’s borderline hit</a> on Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov sparked Florida defenseman <a href="https://x.com/BR_OpenIce/status/1917013209338269767">Aaron Ekblad’s retaliatory headshot</a> that left Hagel concussed. Greer’s cheap shot, punished with only a $2,000 fine, broke hockey’s unspoken code: you never go after a player with a known concussion history, especially one you’ve already injured.</p> <p>So on Saturday, Tampa iced a lineup of AHL enforcers and spent the night exacting frontier justice. The league’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sabourin-nhl-panthers-lightning-8b83aa790d7dfdcfb7821ca9304ec0c5">response</a>? Heavy fines and suspensions for the Lightning, none for Florida.</p>       <figure class="element element-video element--showcase" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3tcFc5GVyo"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T3tcFc5GVyo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The ugly scenes revived an old suspicion: that the NHL’s disciplinary system protects its favorites. The Panthers’ connections only make the optics worse. The league’s director of hockey operations, Colin Campbell, is a longtime power broker whose son is a minority owner and assistant general manager of – you guessed it – the Panthers. The head of player safety, George Parros, is a former Panther himself. A decade ago Campbell’s leaked emails <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/blogger-reveals-scandalous-e-mails-from-nhl-executive-2010-11">showed him berating referees</a> for not giving Florida preferential treatment. Nothing changed.</p> <p>Across the NHL, this latest bloodbath looked like business as usual: a vivid reminder that hockey’s old-boy network pulls the strings on a two-tiered system of justice.</p> <p>The bad blood has been brewing for years. For most of their existence the Panthers were an afterthought, overshadowed by the more successful Lightning, who won the first of their three Stanley Cups in 2004. Then they traded for Matthew Tkachuk – a brilliant, agitating forward – and hired a coach who encouraged the chaos. Overnight, the franchise became an almost comically ratty heel team: relentlessly annoying, gleefully abrasive and somehow good enough to win anyway. They ran goalies, took liberties after whistles, and seemed to delight in their role as the villains of modern hockey.</p> <p>Tampa, by contrast, had built their dynasty on cool precision: a team that mixed speed, skill and structure to win back-to-back Cups in 2020 and 2021. To Lightning fans, Florida’s rise represented something else: the triumph of cynicism, of hockey as provocation rather than craft.</p>    <p>The long-simmering tensions finally exploded in April’s postseason meeting. When Hagel flattened Barkov with what looked like a clean shoulder check – a hockey play at playoff speed gone wrong – the officials ruled it illegal because Barkov hadn’t touched the puck. Hagel was slapped with a one-game suspension. The next night Ekblad, who’d already served a lengthy ban earlier in the season for performance-enhancing drugs, hunted him down and delivered a full-force shot to the head, concussing him – a retaliatory hit that earned just two games. Florida went on to win the series and their second straight Cup, while Tampa were left muttering about double standards.</p> <p>So when Greer targeted Hagel again – during a meaningless September preseason game, no less – the Lightning saw red. Coach Jon Cooper rested his stars and called up six players from the minors – two known enforcers among them – to ice a full lineup without exposing his smaller, skilled forwards. Within minutes, 32-year-old bruiser Scott Sabourin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQmIEQOisCg">leveled Ekblad with a single punch</a> that dropped him to his knees. From there the night descended into absurdity: brawls after nearly every whistle, fights in the penalty box, more than 300 combined penalty minutes and so many ejections that both teams ended with nine skaters. At one point, Florida’s Niko Mikkola even picked up an assist despite having been sent off minutes earlier. It’s not every night an ejected player somehow helps to extend an 8-0 lead before anyone notices.</p> <p>The next day, the discipline meted out by the NHL’s department of player safety came down squarely on Tampa. Six players fined, two suspended, the organization docked $100,000 and Cooper fined another $25,000. Florida’s Greer kept his token $2,000 fine. The perception was plain as day: the Panthers could do no wrong. And that sense of impunity is what has turned a once-anodyne cross-state rivalry into something much darker: a microcosm of how the NHL still protects its insiders and punishes its critics.</p> <p>That defiance fits neatly with the Panthers’ broader identity. Under owner Vincent Viola – a billionaire financier and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/19/vincent-viola-army-secretary-trump">one-time Donald Trump nominee</a> for secretary of the army – the franchise has cultivated an overtly Maga aesthetic. After their first Cup win, team executives proudly visited Trump at the White House, presenting him with a custom “45–47” jersey. Viola’s longtime business partner and minority owner Douglas Cifu, the Panthers’ vice-chairman and alternate governor, also runs Virtu Financial, the high-frequency trading firm he co-founded with Viola. In May, Cifu was suspended indefinitely by the NHL after <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/45128515/panthers-minority-owner-suspended-offensive-social-media-posts">an inflammatory social-media exchange</a> with a Canadian fan where he invoked the Israel-Palestine conflict and Trump’s 51st state taunts, a move that did little to distance the team from its hard-right image.</p>    <p>Across the state, the Lightning’s ownership has taken the opposite tack: removing a Robert E Lee statue from downtown Tampa, supporting diversity initiatives and hosting some of the league’s most inclusive heritage nights.</p> <p>In miniature, the Battle of Florida now mirrors the United States itself: grievance and aggression on one side, progressive branding on the other, both locked in a fight over what the sport, and the country, should be.</p> <p>The irony is that all this has unfolded during what’s meant to be the NHL’s modern age of enlightenment. League executives boast about player safety and mental-health awareness, and evolving beyond the blood-and-guts spectacle of decades past. Yet its disciplinary machinery still operates with the opaque impunity of an old boys’ club. When New York Rangers owner James Dolan <a href="https://bluelinestation.com/2021/05/06/clueless-nhl-fines-new-york-rangers-250k-tweet/">semi-publicly condemned</a> the league’s refusal to suspend Washington’s Tom Wilson in 2021, the NHL didn’t revisit the call; it <a href="https://bluelinestation.com/2021/05/06/clueless-nhl-fines-new-york-rangers-250k-tweet/">fined the team $250,000</a> for daring to question it. Commissioner Gary Bettman scolded the Rangers for “demeaning” a league executive and declared such criticism “unacceptable”. The message was clear enough: silence is rewarded, dissent is punished and the culture that enables violence is the one most fiercely protected.</p> <p>This time, though, the silence has cracked. Around the league, executives and players are said to be quietly rooting for Tampa – not because they condone vigilante justice, but because they recognize the futility of appealing to a system stacked against them. The Panthers may have won the Stanley Cup for two years running, but they’ve also become the embodiment of a league that rewards swagger and punishes accountability.</p> <p>That the NHL’s biggest controversy of the year erupted before a single regular-season game had been played says it all. The sport that keeps promising to modernize still can’t stop celebrating its own anarchy: a league where power, not principle, decides who gets away with what – and who gets left bleeding on the ice.</p>
