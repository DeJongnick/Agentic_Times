According to the World Gold Council’s latest survey, an overwhelming majority of central banks plan to expand reserves, with none expecting to reduce holdings despite record prices. This is not just portfolio tinkering. With conflicts persisting in Europe and the Middle East, and with US–China relations still strained, many central banks probably view gold as an essential hedge against geopolitical risk. Nearly three-quarters of respondents also anticipate a decline in the dollar’s share of reserves, a shift that leaves gold as the natural beneficiary.</p> <p>There is little doubt that gold’s gains have been accelerated because of a weaker US dollar. The greenback has endured one of its poorest years since the early 2000s. By the end of September, the Dollar Index (DXY) was down around 10%. If it finishes the year around these levels, it would mark its weakest performance against major peers since 2003 when the DXY slipped nearly 15%. Much of this year’s weakness is linked to tariffs induced fears of stagflation and a broader sense that America’s economic dominance is being challenged. The trend of de-dollarisation, whereby foreign investors diversify away from US assets, has also gathered pace. For gold, which is priced in dollars, the slide has been an undeniable tailwind, making the metal more attractive for buyers across other currencies.</p> <p>Another primary driver behind gold’s big gains has been the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this year. After a lengthy pause, it resumed trimming rates in September as labour market weakness outweighed concerns over inflation, with the central bank indicating that there may be two more cuts to come in Q4. As a result, bond yields fell. Lower yields make non-interest-bearing assets such as gold relatively more appealing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-02T11:37:59.868Z">at 12.37pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68de57548f08694a84a03d2e" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-02T10:45:58.265Z">11.45am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>On the pharma front, Reuters has this.</p> <p><strong>Pharmaceutical executives are getting near-daily calls from staff at the White House – including chief of staff Susie Wiles, and senior figures at agencies like health &amp; human services and the US commerce department, two sources told the news agency.</strong></p> <p>The drugmaker <strong>Eli Lilly</strong> was asked to produce more insulin; <strong>Pfizer</strong> was asked to produce more of its top-selling cancer drug Ibrance and its cholesterol drug Lipitor; and London-based <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> to consider a new headquarters in the US, according to two sources. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68de51178f08694a84a03cc5" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-02T10:29:11.486Z">11.29am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Eurozone unemployment rate ticks up to 6.3%</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>In the eurozone, the unemployment rate ticked up last month.</p> <p>The jobless rate increased from 6.2% in July to 6.3% in August, according to data from Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office.</p> <p>While the number of unemployed people was 11,000 higher than in July, it was 15,000 lower than in August last year, and 136,000 lower than in June. That puts this uptick into perspective.</p> <p><strong>Bert Colijn</strong>, chief economist, Netherlands at ING, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Employment expectations have steadily weakened over recent years, which means that job growth is under pressure. In September, the Employment Expectations Index by the European Commission ticked down to the lowest level since 2021. Manufacturers are becoming less negative about hiring prospects, but the service sector saw solid job prospects falter last month.</p> <p>And businesses are pushing for productivity gains as wages have increased significantly over recent years. Yet despite all of that, the labour market continues to see unemployment near all-time lows for now.</p> <p>That said, the job market in the eurozone is also quite divided between the south and north. The south is seeing stronger job growth – especially in the private sector – with more structural declines in unemployment. Weaker economic growth in the north of the eurozone is also reflected in more upward pressure on unemployment.
