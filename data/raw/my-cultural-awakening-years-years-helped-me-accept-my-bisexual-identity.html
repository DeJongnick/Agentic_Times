<p>I first discovered Olly Alexander, of Years &amp; Years, by&nbsp;accident. I was teaching English as a foreign language in South Korea, and I showed a&nbsp;video of a BBC Glastonbury roundup on the projector as part of the&nbsp;lesson. I remember glimpsing an&nbsp;incredibly cute blond guy on stage,&nbsp;and being transfixed. I knew immediately that he was gay because&nbsp;the way he moved was unashamedly fluid and graceful. He&nbsp;was doing a pirouette.</p> <p>The clip was so short there wasn’t even a mention of the name of the band, so I had to do some detective work. I Googled something ridiculous like “bleached hair gay man Glastonbury 2015” and trawled through hundreds of search results until I found him.</p> <p>I was 24 and out as bisexual, but I&nbsp;had never done more than kiss a man. I grew up on the west coast of Ireland, and while my area was relatively liberal, we still used the F-slur regularly and referred to anything remotely crap or weak as “gay”. At school, I liked girls enough to distract myself from the fact that I also liked boys – but by the time I&nbsp;was in my final year of university, I wasn’t able to ignore my feelings for men any more. I&nbsp;told friends and family I was bisexual, but I did it in an almost aggressive way. My attitude was: “I’m&nbsp;bisexual and if you have a problem with that, I&nbsp;don’t want to hear about it.” Looking back, I think I was being defensive: I&nbsp;didn’t want to discuss my sexuality because I&nbsp;wasn’t entirely comfortable with it yet.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>Olly refers to his love interest as ‘boy’, and I remember listening out for that word and feeling electrified by it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It made me feel vulnerable to accept that I was interested in men because it messed with my sense of masculinity. I am still often perceived by strangers as straight. When I did develop a crush on a boy, growing up, it would be a&nbsp;macho lad who liked football and girls. Discovering Olly Alexander was seismic for me because it was the first time I fancied a man who was openly gay in his presentation. In the weeks after I found Olly online, I listened to&nbsp;Years &amp; Years’ debut album, Communion, on repeat. In a few songs, Olly refers to his love interest as “boy”, and I remember listening out for that word and feeling electrified by it.</p> <p>I was taking taekwondo lessons in my spare time, and I suggested to my instructor that we put Communion on&nbsp;in the background while we trained. Because it’s a form of combat, taekwondo is a hypermasculine sport, but it is also elegant and feminine in&nbsp;the sense that it is like a dance. Listening to that music while doing those moves made me feel as if I was pulling together the two parts of my&nbsp;own nature, and finding some balance between the masculine and the feminine.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/02/my-cultural-awakening-minecraft-jordan-gray-transgender">My cultural awakening: Minecraft taught me how to navigate life as a transgender person – one block at a time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the point in the session when we&nbsp;were doing a particularly high-intensity kicking routine, the song King would start playing on the record – which is&nbsp;all about being desired by&nbsp;another man on a night out. My instructor loved the record too, although he was a&nbsp;very traditional South Korean man, and from small comments he had made I could tell he was casually homophobic. He had no idea that he was enjoying an album about gay men in the club.</p> <p>The music unlocked something in me. I began to pursue boys and go to gay clubs.My first sexual experiences with men happened at precisely the same time as I was discovering Communion. When I listen to Shine now – which is about the magnetic feeling between two men – I still get this feeling in my&nbsp;stomach. It’s difficult for me to disentangle the feeling of desire from the excitement I&nbsp;feel when I hear the opening bars. I&nbsp;started dating my first boyfriend around the time Years &amp; Years’ second album, Palo Santo, came out, so Olly Alexander’s music doesn’t just sound like lust to me. It also sounds like love. <strong>Anonymous</strong></p> <p><em>Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?
