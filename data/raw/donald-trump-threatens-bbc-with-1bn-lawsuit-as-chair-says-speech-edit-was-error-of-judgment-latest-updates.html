  <p>The editing of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> speech on 6 January 2021 has embroiled the BBC in controversy, led to the resignations of its top leaders, and given fuel to claims of media bias at the storied British broadcaster.</p> 
  <p>A dossier from a former external adviser to the BBC’s editorial standards committee flagged the edit, among other instances of purported bias in the outlet’s coverage, which was leaked to the Telegraph. As a public sector organization, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc">BBC</a> is required to be impartial, though it often faces claims of bias, particularly from the right.</p> 
  <p>In a broadcast of the news show Panorama before the 2024 election, Trump’s speech was edited to put together two sentences that were actually 54 minutes apart, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2025/nov/10/side-by-side-comparison-of-bbc-edited-trump-speech-from-day-of-capitol-attack-with-original-video">making it appear</a> as though he was telling people they would walk to the US Capitol and “fight like hell”.</p> 
  <p>After Trump’s speech, thousands of his supporters descended on the US Capitol, some of them entering the building and brawling with police to try to stop the electoral count. Five people died within days, marking a violent start to Joe Biden’s presidency.</p> 
  <p>The scandal had provided Trump another avenue to attack the media, this time overseas, and to relitigate the circumstances of the 2020 election and his attempts to overturn the results. He has threatened legal action against the BBC.</p> 
  <p>“The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”</p> 
  <p>The BBC’s chair, Samir Shah, called the edit an “error in judgement”.</p>

  <p>Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi is organising a letter to be sent to the culture secretary Lisa Nandy seeking clarification on whether the BBC board prevented a swift apology going out for the Panorama Trump edit and also why Tim Davie felt the need to state the BBC shouldn’t be “weaponised” in his resignation letter.</p> 
  <p>Antoniazzi told the BBC: “I’m not BBC bashing – I want to protect it.</p> 
  <p>“With both the director general and the head of news gone and threats of legal action from President Trump, this is a significant moment for the organisation.</p> 
  <p>“It’s up to us as parliamentarians to stand up for a free press – the fourth pillar of democracy – and help preserve the BBC’s journalistic integrity at all costs.”</p> 
  <p>She added: “This transparency is vital to allow the BBC to move on, and enable its news operation to continue its role providing fair, accurate, impartial news in a deeply polarised world, plagued by misinformation.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Key takeaways from events today at the BBC</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A lot has happened today following the shock resignations of the BBC’s director general Tim Davies and News CEO Deborah Turness on Sunday night.</p> 
  <p>Let’s go through things chronologically, to show how it all unfolded.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>9:45am GMT:</strong> Deborah Turness, the outgoing News CEO, turns up to the BBC’s London headquarters on Monday morning where she faces the press pack. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/live/2025/nov/10/bbc-tim-davie-resigns-bias-panorama-donald-trump-latest-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6911b6858f087353b0fc6782#block-6911b6858f087353b0fc6782">She defends BBC journalism</a>, dismissing President Trump’s attack that BBC journalists are corrupt.</p></li> 
   <li><p><em>“Our journalists aren’t corrupt. Our journalists are hardworking people who strive for impartiality. And I will stand by their journalism</em>,” she says. <em>“There is no institutional bias. Mistakes are made, but there’s no institutional bias.”</em></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Midday:</strong> The Chair of the BBC, Samir Shah, releases the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/50118/documents/270340/default/">long-awaited letter addressing journalistic errors</a>, including most crucially, the Panorama documentary which spliced together different parts of Donald Trump’s January 6 speech.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Shah accepts that the edit gave <em><strong>“the impression of a direct call for violent action”</strong></em> and was <strong>“</strong><em><strong>an error of judgement”</strong></em><strong>.</strong> He apologises on behalf of the BBC. He also details action taken to address errors made on other stories including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/live/2025/nov/10/bbc-tim-davie-resigns-bias-panorama-donald-trump-latest-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6911df568f087ec9f3660c92#block-6911df568f087ec9f3660c92">Gaza coverage.</a></p></li> 
   <li><p>Immediately after the letter’s release, <strong>the BBC also airs an interview with Shah</strong> where he rejects allegations of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/live/2025/nov/10/bbc-tim-davie-resigns-bias-panorama-donald-trump-latest-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6911e6f38f08d3736687b113#block-6911e6f38f08d3736687b113">“systemic bias”</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/live/2025/nov/10/bbc-tim-davie-resigns-bias-panorama-donald-trump-latest-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6911efb78f087ec9f3660d3b#block-6911efb78f087ec9f3660d3b">“anti-Israel bias”</a> in the newsroom and says the board is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/live/2025/nov/10/bbc-tim-davie-resigns-bias-panorama-donald-trump-latest-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6911eac48f087ec9f3660d18#block-6911eac48f087ec9f3660d18">“not overly political”</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p>This comes amid reports, including by The Guardian, of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2025/nov/10/were-the-bbc-resignations-politically-orchestrated-podcast">a political campaign orchestrated by enemies within the BBC </a>to bring it down. Shah says he and the board did not want Davie to resign.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>1.30pm:</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/live/2025/nov/10/bbc-tim-davie-resigns-bias-panorama-donald-trump-latest-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-691209628f08a98bc75927eb#block-691209628f08a98bc75927eb">US President Donald Trump threatens in a letter to sue the BBC.</a> His lawyers claim that Trump, who was indicted by Congress for efforts to overturn the 2020 vote, has been defamed by the BBC’s Panorama episode. They issue a Friday deadline to the BBC, demanding the news organisation make amends or they will launch a $1 billion lawsuit. The BBC says it is reviewing the letter.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The Labour government and the Lib Dems have at various points today defended the BBC. Downing St says the BBC is not corrupt not institutionally biased and plays a vital role in the age of disinformation. The Conservatives and Reform say the BBC has shown bias.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>4.30pm:</strong> The BBC’s deputy head of news, now temporarily in charge of editorial decisions, sends out an all-staff email announcing a pan-BBC call tomorrow.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Departures 'due to a political campaign'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>“It feels like a coup,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/09/tim-davie-expected-to-resign-bbc-director-general">sources from within the News department have told The Guardian. </a>“This is the result of a campaign by political enemies of the BBC.”</p> 
  <p>The crisis was triggered by a Telegraph report on the leaked letter from <strong>Michael Prescott</strong> detailing errors made by BBC News.</p> 
  <p>Prescott was previously an independent adviser on the BBC’s senior editorial guidelines and standards committee (EGSC). He left in summer after three years on the panel, and wrote a letter detailing BBC errors to the BBC board after that.</p> 
  <p>Our Media editor Michael Savage reports that the departures of Davie and Turness appear to be an attempt to protect the BBC from further attacks following Prescott’s criticisms.</p> 
  <p>While many BBC figures believe Prescott’s letter referred to some genuine errors, there is also concern that it has been exploited by political opponents.</p> 
  <p>Some BBC figures have pointed to an effort to shift the corporation politically, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/07/boris-johnson-trying-to-undermine-bbc-leadership-insiders-fear-after-leak">dating back to Boris Johnson’s time in government</a>.</p> 
  <p>The Guardian has been told Prescott’s appointment as an external adviser had been pushed by the BBC board member <strong>Robbie Gibb</strong>, <strong>Theresa May’s former communications chief</strong> who helped set up the <strong>rightwing broadcaster GB News</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Gibb was first placed on the BBC board during Johnson’s time in government.</strong> Gibb and Prescott have previously been reported as being friends. Gibb was on a four-person interview panel that appointed Prescott.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>Johnson told the Guardian that any suggestion of an attempt to undermine the BBC was “complete and utter bollocks”. Prescott said in his letter that his criticisms “do not come with any political agenda”.</p> 
  <p>The BBC’s chair attached Mr Prescott’s letter in his submission to the parliamentary culture and media committee today. <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/50118/documents/270340/default/">You can read it here.</a></p> 
  <p>Meanwhile others have also described what happened as politically-motivated. David Yelland, a former Sun editor and now presenter of a BBC podcast, said the departures were “a coup” orchestrated from the inside.</p> 
  <p>He told the BBC’s Radio 4’s Today programme that Davie and Turness had been systematically undermined by people close to the BBC board over a lengthy period.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">BBC to hold all-staff call tomorrow</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The BBC’s deputy head of news Jonathan Munro has just sent out an all-staff email acknowledging the crises. An all-BBC call will be held tomorrow, and another meeting for News staff on Wednesday.</p> 
  <p>“Following events of the last 24 hours, I’m writing alongside the rest of the News Board to acknowledge how difficult this situation is and reassure you that our vital and valued work providing trusted journalism continues.”</p> 
  <p>He says the coming weeks will be hard but “our trusted, impartial and agenda-setting journalism is more important than ever and must continue as our audiences expect.”</p> 
  <p>Munro also acknowledges the work of Deborah Turness, the outgoing head of news.</p> 
  <p>“Details are still being worked through about what happens next. Deborah’s successor will be appointed and we’ll share everything we can as soon as we know it.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">BBC concedes Trump video edit gave impression of 'direct call for violence'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The BBC’s chair today admitted an “error of judgement” in the editing of Trump’s January 6 speech, which has prompted this defamation threat from the US president.</p> 
  <p>It showed two sections of the speech that were spliced together when they had been delivered an hour apart, and the edit did not note that Trump had also said he wanted his supporters to demonstrate peacefully.</p> 
  <p>Critics had said the edit made it look like Trump had encouraged the US Capitol attack. ( A reminder to readers that the US president was indeed indicted by Congress, and faced criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.)</p> 
  <p>The BBC’s Chair said today that upon review of the complaint:</p> 
  <p><strong>“We accept that the</strong> <strong>way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.</strong> <strong>The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement.”</strong></p> 
  <p>BBC News has also issued the same apology in recent hours, adding that there had been no intention to mislead.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, in response to the resignations of Davie and Turness, Trump had attacked the BBC’s journalism, and praised the Telegraph for highlighting errors.</p> 
  <p>The rightwing Telegraph last week published <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/11/03/bbc-report-reveals-bias-donald-trump/">a leaked internal report</a> by Prescott, a former BBC standards adviser, who alleged failings in BBC coverage on transgender issues, Gaza and the edit of a Trump speech from January 6 during the Capitol Hill insurrection.</p> 
  <p>Trump wrote on Truth Social:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In showing up at New Broadcasting House this morning, the BBC’s outgoing head of news <strong>Deborah Turness</strong> defended the organisation’s journalists.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“Our journalists are hard-working people who strive for impartiality and I stand by their journalism.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She also said there was “no institutional bias at the BBC”, a sentiment also repeated by Chair Samir Shah today. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump threatening $1 billion lawsuit against BBC</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>American media is reporting that the US president has threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn (£760m) if the news organisation does not make amends by Friday.</p> 
  <p>NBC and Fox News have details of the letter sent to the BBC, which accuses the organisation of making “false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements” in the Panorama documentary edit of Trump’s January 6 speech.</p> 
  <p>Trump has accused the BBC of defamation in a lawsuit lodged under Florida state law.</p> 
  <p>“Due to their salacious nature, the fabricated statements that were aired by the BBC have been widely disseminated throughout various digital mediums, which have reached tens of millions of people worldwide.</p> 
  <p>“Consequently, the BBC has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,” the letter reads, according to Fox.</p> 
  <p>It demands amends from the BBC and says that: “If the BBC does not comply with the above by November 14, 2025, at 5:00 p.m. EST, President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages. The BBC is on notice.”</p> 
  <p>The BBC is yet to respond to Trump’s demands.</p>

  <p>The National Union for Journalists (NUJ), which represents more than 30,000 members in media, has reacted to the resignations and set out some of the challenges the new director-general will face when they take up the job from Tim Davie.</p> 
  <p>As a reminder, there is no timescale for when Davie will be replaced and a successor has not been chosen. </p> 
  <p><strong>Laura Davison</strong>, NUJ general secretary, <a href="https://www.nuj.org.uk/resource/nuj-reacts-to-bbc-leadership-resignations.html">said in a statement</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted">

   <p><em>The new director-general must be politically independent and able to face the increasing challenges posed by financial pressures, AI-supercharged fake news, and efforts to undermine the importance of public service broadcasting.</em></p>

  <p>Former – and current – BBC journalists have reacted to the resignations of outgoing BBC director general Tim Davie and CEO of News Deborah Turness after accusations that the corporation was failing in its duty of impartiality.</p> 
  <p><strong>Lewis Goodall</strong>, News Agents presenter and former Newsnight policy editor, said the editing of Trump’s speech was a “mistake” even though it may not have “fundamentally” misrepresented the US president’s “overall actions” in the lead up to January 6 2021 and on the day itself.</p> 
  <p>He <a href="https://x.com/lewis_goodall/status/1987668429789127074">added in a post on X</a>: “I’m no fan of Davie, indeed I think he’s brought a fair bit of this on himself, but the hysteria over this story is on another level.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Emily Maitlis</strong>, who used to present the BBC’s flagship evening news programme Newsnight and is now a News Agents presenter alongside Goodall and Jon Sopel, <a href="https://x.com/maitlis/status/1987598792343101550">said </a>the story is “far more complicated than the headline resignations suggest- dramatic as those are”.</p> 
  <p><strong>John Simpson</strong>, who joined the BBC in 1966, <a href="https://x.com/JohnSimpsonNews/status/1987623247903658258">warned</a> that the BBC is in “real danger now”, saying the corporation is “going to need the support of everyone who thinks that public service broadcasting … is worth defending”.</p> 
  <p><strong>James Lansdale</strong>, BBC News’ diplomatic correspondent, <a href="https://x.com/BBCJLandale/status/1987789023901831618">posted on X</a>: “Amid all the guff, just this: I am proud to work for BBC News &amp; even prouder to work alongside so many outstanding colleagues. We are not perfect; we must always strive to be better. But in a darkening world, we remain a shaft of light. Worth mulling. All best from Kyiv.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>There was a lot said by the BBC Chair, Samir Shah, in his televised interview with Katie Razzall, the BBC’s culture and media editor.</p> 
  <p>Just minutes after broadcast, the BBC also confirmed it had received a letter threatening legal action from US President Donald Trump.</p> 
  <p>In the interview, the BBC Chair:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Apologised for the “error of judgement” made in the Panorama edit of Trump’s speech in the lead up to the January 6 Capitol riots, but noted that the edit had been done to “convey the message” of Trump’s speech.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Noted that they were prepared for the prospect – now confirmed – of Trump litigation.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Denied any “systemic bias” in news coverage, and denied accusations the BBC has an “anti-Israel bias”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Said the BBC board is “not overly political”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Stressed repeatedly that the BBC has taken action over the past three years in addressing editorial mistakes and that Prescott’s letter did not reveal new issues, but touched on ones already looked at.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Admitted that the range of corrective action taken might not have gone far enough.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">'We addressed problems long before Prescott memo'- Shah</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Chair also rejected the accusations that the BBC had only admitted to mistakes because of the leak of Prescott’s memo in the Daily Telegraph last week.</p> 
  <p>He says it’s “simply not true” that the BBC wasn’t being accountable to mistakes and repeated again that Prescott didn’t unearth the issues but were privy to them precisely because of his position on the ethics and standards committee.</p> 
  <p>“We knew all about those issues long before Mr. Prescott said that,” he says, also referencing the Panorama Trump edit.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“We knew about it, and we’ve taken actions. We’ve taken actions throughout the three years.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Shah says they’ve taken action such as issuing disciplinary measures and changing leadership structures. His letter to the the parliamentary committee also specified new watchdog roles that were created to prevent further mistakes happening.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“We have done things. It’s entirely arguable we should do more. Fine. That’s fair enough. But it’s not right to say we sit there doing nothing.</p> 
   <p>“We did not need the Telegraph piece to tell us that these things were wrong and you should take action. We have.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Shah rejects accusation BBC has anti-Israel bias in Middle East coverage</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>When asked to clarify a response on whether the BBC has that bias and failed to address it Shah said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em><br><strong>“</strong></em><strong>I don’t think there’s a systemic bias in [the BBC being] anti-Israel. I mean, there are loads of arguments that suggest almost the opposite.</strong></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think that we have issues, as we have talked about underlying problems, and we’ve made changes in needed to try and deal with that.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>As we reported earlier, in his <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/50118/documents/270340/default/">letter to parliament</a> Shah identifies changes that had been made at BBC Arabic and in some longform journalism divisions – where corrections were issued about some Gaza reporting.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>But I think <strong>it’s worth talking about the scale of the BBC… and how much excellent, impartial journalism it does.</strong> It’s difficult. It is a massive organisation.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He says the BBC has put out hundreds and hundreds of hours of coverage of Israel and the Middle East and that while there have been mistakes and <strong>“we should own up to mistakes when we have them”</strong> – those errors need to be put in the context of the news organisation’s three years of coverage of Gaza.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“Let’s have a sense of perspective and proportionality”.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We’ll just delve back into that interview now because the BBC Chair made several points during it.</p> 
  <p>Firstly, when asked if he thought the BBC board was overtly political, he said: “No, I do not” and he also dismissed the idea that there were forces working within the BBC to destroy it as “a fanciful notion of what happens at the board.”</p> 
  <p>“It really does have a diversity of views, as there are in the public, in the country.”<br><br>When questioned if the board had wanted the BBC’s Head of News, Deborah Turness, to leave, he said this was not up to the board.</p> 
  <p>“Let’s be clear about the role of the board. We are a non-executive with ten of us a non-executive for exactly. The job of the board is to review BBC output and to maintain and to represent the public interest. It is not our job to determine who who should not be the director of news. That is the job of the director general.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Downing Street has said the BBC is not corrupt nor institutionally biased, as the corporation comes under intense pressure for its coverage of a range of issues.</p> 
  <p>The prime minister’s official spokesperson told reporters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>On the question of is the BBC corrupt? No. The BBC has a vital role in an age of disinformation … where there’s a clear argument for a robust, impartial British news service to deliver, and that case is stronger than ever.</em></p> 
   <p><em>I think I’ve already addressed some of the comments that have been made over the last 24 hours, but we are of the view that it’s important that the BBC acts swiftly to maintain trust and correct mistakes quickly when they occur.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>On the future of the BBC licence fee, the spokesperson reportedly refused to confirm whether or not it was on the table as part of a review of the royal charter (see post at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/live/2025/nov/10/bbc-tim-davie-resigns-bias-panorama-donald-trump-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-6911d5668f08a98bc75924d2#block-6911d5668f08a98bc75924d2">12.18</a> for more information about the charter).</p>

  <p>He went on to say that the BBC has tried to be transparent and tackle criticism head on by issuing corrections when journalists have been inaccurate, altering guidance to make the BBC’s stance on issues “clearer” and changing leadership when necessary.</p> 
  <p>Shah said the Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee (EGSC) accepts that there are “occasions when the BBC gets things wrong” or its reporting “requires more context and explanation”.

  <p>The resignations of outgoing director general Tim Davie and CEO of News Deborah Turness come as the BBC heads into crucial talks with the government over the renewal of its charter, which sets the corporation’s mission, public purposes and funding.</p> 
  <p>Last November, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the government would use a review of the BBC’s royal charter to consider alternative ways of funding the corporation.</p> 
  <p>She has ruled out using general taxation to fund the BBC, saying this would leave it too open to interference from the government of the day, and insisted the public should be involved in decisions on the licence fee.</p> 
  <p>The government has committed to increasing the licence fee in line with inflation each year until 2027.</p> 
  <p>The BBC has been increasingly cash-strapped, following years when the licence was frozen, and has made sweeping cuts to the organisation as it desperately searches for savings. </p> 
  <p>Half a million people cancelled their licence fee in 2023, as younger audiences <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jul/23/half-million-households-cancelled-bbc-licence-fee-last-year">move towards YouTube and streamers</a> and many people get their news from social media or alternative outlets. </p>

  <p>Reform UK leader <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> claimed the BBC “has been institutionally biased for decades” as he appeared at a press conference in central London.</p> 
  <p>Farage also said he had spoken with his ally Donald Trump on Friday after concerns were raised about the way a speech by the US president was edited for Panorama.</p> 
  <p>The Reform UK leader said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>I actually spoke to the president on Friday. He just said to me: ‘Is this how you treat your best ally?’ It’s quite a powerful comment So there’s been too much going for too long.</em></p>

  <p>Farage said last year half a million people stopped paying the licence fee adding that millions more people could start doing the same if the culture within the coopration remains the same.</p> 
  <p>He say he would like to see the BBC “slimmed down” and to only do “straight news”, adding that the BBC World Service is “very important”.</p> 
  <p>Farage said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>When it comes to entertainment, when it comes to sport and many other areas like that, they should compete against everybody else (with) a subscription model. That’s the modern world that we live in.</em></p>

  <p>Farage said Davie should be replaced as director-general by “somebody from the private sector who has gone into a failing organisation and has not just turned round the profitability, but the culture”. </p> 
  <p>Reform has managed to capitalise on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/09/how-keir-starmers-polling-became-one-of-the-worst-in-the-west-in-charts">record unpopularity for the new Labour government</a> and is leading in many opinion polls, meaning Farage could be the UK’s next prime minister.</p>

  <p><strong>Ed Davey</strong>, the Lib Dem leader, has written to the UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform leader Nigel Farage after what he describes as Donald Trump’s “assault on the BBC”.</p> 
  <p>He wrote in his letter <a href="https://x.com/EdwardJDavey/status/1987843483349000328/photo/1">posted to X</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>President Tump’s assault on the BBC is a serious threat to our national interest, and I urge you to join me in standing up against it …</em></p> 
   <p><em>It should be extremely concerning to us all to see the President of the United States pressuring the BBC over its leadership and attacking its journalists as “corrupt”, and his press secretary telling everyone to “watch GB News”.</em></p> 
   <p><em>It should not be up to foreign powers to dictate where the British people get their news from. We must stand united to defend our democracy from foreign interference like this – even when it comes from a crucial ally.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Davey defended the BBC as a public broadcaster in the UK and said that as a trusted source of information helps project Britain’s soft power around the globe.</p> 
  <p>“We have watched with alarm as Trump and his allies have undermined the free press in the United States, and all the damage that has done to American democracy. We cannot let that happen here,” he added.</p> 
  <p>His comments come after Donald Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, described the BBC as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine” in an interview with the Telegraph, in which she said watching BBC bulletins while on trips to the UK “ruins” her day and said taxpayers were being “forced to foot the bill for a leftist propaganda machine”.</p>

  <p><strong>Mark Urban</strong>, a former presenter on Newsnight, the BBC’s flagship daily current affairs show, has said the corporation has changed in recent years, suggesting that this reflects generational tensions within the newsroom.</p> 
  <p>“The BBC, including Deborah Turness, were not willing to listen to and act sufficiently and energetically upon the recommendations of their own internal system for checking bias,” Urban told Sky News.</p> 
  <p>“Now we saw that leaked memo with a long list of things. We’ve all focused on the Trump interview, but there was stuff about gender issues, there was stuff about race, there was stuff about Gaza and I think when you put all those things collectively together, we understand.”</p> 
  <p>Urban added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>And if you have been in meetings as I have for many years, you have seen the BBC change in recent years.</em></p> 
   <p><em>I think in common with many other news organisations and many other publicly funded organisations, but you have seen that much more for want of a better word ‘woke’ tendency among younger members of staff and the tension between young and old and of course that is what’s burst out here.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">BBC director general was slow to act, culture committee chair says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We have heard from Culture, Media and Sport committee chair<strong> Caroline Dinenage</strong>, who has suggested that the outgoing BBC director Tim Davie ignored an internal dossier into bias at the BBC (see post at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/live/2025/nov/10/bbc-tim-davie-resigns-bias-panorama-donald-trump-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-6911a7ee8f082a732225a43a#block-6911a7ee8f082a732225a43a">09.06</a> for more detail on the dossier). </p> 
  <p>She said Davie “ignored” concerns raised in Michael Prescott’s report <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/03/bbc-accused-selectively-editing-trump-clip-capitol-attack">over the way the speech by Donald Trump was edited for Panorama</a>.</p> 
  <p>Dinenage said she is expecting a letter for BBC Chair Samir Shah later today, but confirmed that it has not yet arrived.</p> 
  <p>She told BBC Radio 4’s Today:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>I’m very sad about Tim Davie stepping down. I think he was an effective leader at the BBC.</em></p> 
   <p><em>I think he was a great champion for public service media, but there is no escaping the fact that he was very slow to act on this particular issue. But this isn’t the first time and on this particular issue, Michael Prescott’s report, he just didn’t take it seriously until it was too late.</em></p> 
   <p><em>He should have reacted with concern and examined the claims, but just ignored it.</em></p> 
   <p><em>But you know, I do feel it was entirely avoidable and it’s really regretful given the huge commitment to the BBC and public service that Tim Davie demonstrated.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Dinenage added that she thinks it seems “a little bit odd” that her committee has not yet heard from Shah, who is expected to apologise for the way a speech by Donald Trump to crowds at the Capitol on January 6 2021 was edited for current affairs programme Panorama.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">BBC News is not institutionally biased, Deborah Turness says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Deborah Turness</strong>, the outgoing CEO of news, said the following as she arrived at the BBC this morning in London:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>I would like to say it has been the privilege of my career to serve as the CEO of BBC News and to work with our brilliant team of journalists.</em></p> 
   <p><em>I stepped down over the weekend because the buck stops with me. But I’d like to make one thing very clear, BBC News is not institutionally biased. That’s why it’s the world’s most trusted news provider.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She was quoted as having said that “our journalists aren’t corrupt and I will stand by their journalism”.</p> 
  <p>Turness made her name as editor of ITV News, before moving to New York in 2013 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/may/31/guardian-profile-deborah-turness-itv-nbc-news">to run the sprawling NBC News</a> operation.</p> 
  <p>In 2021, Turness returned to ITN – who make news programmes for ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 – as chief executive.</p> 
  <p>She has been the CEO of BBC News since 2022, overseeing BBC News and Current Affairs programming and having responsibility for a team of about 6,000 people.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">What sort of bias has the BBC been accused of?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Telegraph’s leaked BBC memo suggested a range of issues at the BBC, not just the way Donald Trump’s Capitol speech had been selectively edited for the Panorama programme. </p> 
  <p>The leaked memo came from <strong>Michael Prescott</strong>, a former independent standards adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee.</p> 
  <p>Prescott left his role earlier this year and has not commented on the document, understood to have been leaked by a whistleblower.</p> 
  <p>The Telegraph said Prescott alleged there were “systemic problems”, which had not been addressed by senior management, claiming there were “stark differences” between the coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza on BBC Arabic and on the main BBC website. One issue Prescott reportedly highlighted is the repeated use of commentators who were antisemitic or pro-Hamas.</p> 
  <p>As my colleague <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/08/bbc-100-fake-news-says-donald-trumps-press-secretary">notes in this story</a>, the 19-page dossier is also reported to have criticised the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues, saying the broadcaster had been “captured by a small group of [staff] promoting the Stonewall view” of gender identity issues and that its LGBT desk would “decline to cover any stories raising difficult questions”.</p> 
  <p>It is said to have alleged that stories raising complex questions about trans issues were suppressed, with a “constant drip-feed of one-sided stories celebrating the trans experience without adequate balance or objectivity”.</p>

   <p><em>The culture at the BBC has not yet changed. BBC Arabic must be brought under urgent control. The BBC’s US and Middle East coverage needs a full overhaul.

   <p><em>The new leadership must now deliver genuine reform of the culture of the BBC, top to bottom – because it should not expect the public to keep funding it through a compulsory licence fee unless it can finally demonstrate true impartiality.</em></p>

  <p>The resignations of Tim Davie and Deborah Turness was “a coup”, a former newspaper editor has said.</p> 
  <p><strong>David Yelland</strong>, who edited The Sun from 1998 to 2003, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that their departure “was a coup, and worse than that, it was an inside job”.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>There were people inside the BBC, very close to the board … who have systematically undermined Tim Davie and his senior team over a period and this has been going on for a long time. What happened yesterday didn’t just happen in isolation.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>“What has happened here is there was a failure of governance,” he said. “I don’t blame the chairman [Samir Shah] as an individual, but the job of the chair of any organisation, a company – including the BBC – is to keep their CEO, their top man or woman, in post or fire them.</p> 
  <p>“And that has not happened, because Tim Davie was not fired. He walked and so there was, that is the definition of a failure of governance.”</p>

  <p>Donald Trump welcomed the resignations of Tim Davie and Deborah Turness. He wrote on his Truth Social platform last night that the way his speech had been edited by Panorama was an attempt to “step on the scales of a presidential election”, adding: “What a terrible thing for Democracy!”</p> 
  <p>The edit suggested Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.” The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.</p>
