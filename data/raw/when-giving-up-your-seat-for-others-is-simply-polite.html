<p>The suggestion that young, fit people do not offer their seats on public transport to vulnerable people for fear of offending them is nonsense (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/07/is-anything-more-awkward-and-potentially-insulting-than-giving-up-your-seat-on-public-transport">Is anything more awkward – and potentially insulting – than giving up your seat on public transport?, 7&nbsp;September</a>). I was brought up to offer my seat to any woman (of whatever disposition) or elderly person as a matter of principle. In 60 years of doing so, I have never had other than a polite demurral –&nbsp;more usually&nbsp;acceptance.</p> <p>Now that the boot is on the other&nbsp;foot (for which I need a walking stick to maintain my balance), I find that about 30% of young people will instinctively offer me succour, which I gratefully and gracefully accept. The rest don’t seem to care. </p> <p>There is nothing&nbsp;nuanced about it: they are&nbsp;either thoughtless or plain selfish. But I take great comfort in those with compassion –&nbsp;in time, they will prevail.<br><strong>Ian MacKellar</strong><br><em>Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire</em></p> <p>• I think Polly Hudson may have missed&nbsp;the point about Celia Imrie’s&nbsp;dismay about not being offered a seat for the duration of her&nbsp;train journey.</p> <p>Last month, I boarded a very crowded train in London Euston bound for Milton Keynes with my 73-year-old Spanish friend who had&nbsp;fallen the previous day –&nbsp;we&nbsp;were transporting her around&nbsp;in a wheelchair. Her daughter looked around the packed&nbsp;carriage in consternation. Don’t worry, I said, I will sort it.</p> <p>I&nbsp;looked around the carriage and chose the nearest, seemingly fittest, young man and asked him to give up his seat for my&nbsp;friend. “Well, it’s not a seat for the less able,” was the reply. </p> <p>After a lot of huffing and puffing,&nbsp;he did eventually get up&nbsp;and went off in a huge sulk to find another seat. I proceeded to sit&nbsp;on the carriage floor on a plastic&nbsp;bag (I’m 73 years old too).<br><strong>Judith Heinemann</strong><br><em>Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>• I have read and heard many rationalisations for lots of different things, but this one takes the biscuit. Embarrassed? For trying to be courteous? It feels far fetched. I am old, but to get to see the operas and concerts that I love, I have to take a tram to the centre of my nearest traffic-conscious city. Trams are frequently crowded and the journey is quite long, but I need never worry, for someone will inevitably offer their seat to me within seconds. If it were otherwise, many of us older generation would be excluded from society.<br><strong>Joan Lewis</strong><br><em>St Etienne de Gourgas, France</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
