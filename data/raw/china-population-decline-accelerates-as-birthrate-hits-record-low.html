<p>China’s population decline has accelerated, with a second year of record-low birthrates.</p> <p>The total number of people in China dropped by 2.75 million – or 0.2% – to 1.409 billion in 2023, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday. The drop <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/17/chinas-population-falls-for-first-time-in-more-than-60-years">surpassed that recorded in 2022, of about 850,000</a> – the first time the recorded population had declined since the mass deaths of the Mao-era famines.</p> <p>In 2023, total deaths rose 6.6% to 11.1 million, with the death rate reaching the highest level since the chaos of the cultural revolution in 1974. At the same time, new births fell 5.7% to 9.02 million. The birthrate was the lowest ever recorded at 6.39 births per 1,000 people, down from a rate of 6.77 births in 2022.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/25/beijings-demographic-crisis-means-china-could-get-old-before-it-gets-rich">Beijing’s demographic crisis means China could get old before it gets rich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>China has for years been battling trends that have led to an ageing population, which were driven by past policies of population control –<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/29/china-abandons-one-child-policy#:~:text=China%20has%20scrapped%20its%20one,more%20than%20three%20decades%20ago.">including the one-child policy</a> – and a growing reluctance among young adults to have children.

The state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences has predicted the pension system in its current form will run out of money by 2035. By then the number of people in China above 60 years old – the national retirement age – will have increased from about 280 million to 400 million.</p> <p>A raft of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/china-to-hold-nationwide-survey-on-population-changes-as-birthrate-plummets">policies have failed to encourage people to have more children</a>, or have not been properly implemented by local governments, which are suffering budget shortfalls after years of running the resource-intensive zero-Covid system.</p> <p>People frequently cite the high costs of living in China – particularly in larger cities – as well as poor support for women in jobs, as reasons for not having children. Traditional gender roles and familial expectations have also contributed.</p> <p>“Though cities have released a slew of … policies to support child-bearing women to give birth, the public’s expectation is still not being met,” He Dan, director of China Population and Development Research Center, told state media outlet the Global Times.</p> <p>On Tuesday, demographers proposed further reforms of fertility support policies, the Global Times reported. Some also drew hope from suggestions that there may be more babies born in 2024 in a post-pandemic baby boom, or because people wished to have children born in the Chinese zodiac year of the dragon, which starts in February.</p> <p>Online, some Chinese Weibo users said they had anecdotally noticed many more pregnancies around them which they linked to the zodiac year.</p> <p>Others were more sceptical, saying a single year baby boom would make life difficult for those children who would later sit for China’s highly competitive college entrance exam.</p> <p>Several discussions suggested new policies or auspicious years would do little to change their minds. “It’s because I love myself more, and I know that if I was born in a family that is not capable of raising and educating a child, I would suffer more, and I would not be able to experience the joy of life, so let’s cut off the suffering from my generation,” said one commentator.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this report</em></p>
