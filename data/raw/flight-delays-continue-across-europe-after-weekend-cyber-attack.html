<p>Passengers are facing another day of flight delays across Europe, as big airports continue to grapple with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/20/heathrow-airport-delays-cyber-attack-berlin-brussels-cancelled-delays">aftermath of a cyber-attack </a>on the company behind the software used for check-in and boarding.</p> <p>Several of the largest airports in Europe, including London Heathrow, have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/21/delays-continue-at-heathrow-brussels-and-berlin-airports-after-alleged-cyber-attack">trying to restore normal operations</a> over the past few days after an attack on Friday disrupted automatic check-in and boarding software.</p> <p>The problem stemmed from Collins Aerospace, a software provider that works with several airlines across the world.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/22/rachel-reeves-gatwick-second-runway-growth-jobs-environmental-disaster-business-live-news">Rachel Reeves says Gatwick second runway shows government is ‘backing builders, not blockers’ – business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company, which is a subsidiary of the US aerospace and defence company RTX, said on Monday that it was working with four affected airports and airline customers, and was in the final stages of completing the updates needed to restore full functionality.</p> <p>The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity said on Monday that Collins had suffered a ransomware attack. This is a type of cyber-attack where hackers in effect lock up the target’s data and systems in an attempt to secure a ransom.</p> <p>Airports in Brussels, Dublin and Berlin have also experienced delays. While kiosks and bag-drop machines have been offline, airline staff have instead relied on manual processing.</p> <p>The government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall KC, said it was possible state-sponsored hackers could be behind the attack.</p> <p>When asked if a state such as Russia could have been responsible, Hall told Times Radio “anything is possible”.</p> <p>He added that while people thought, “understandably, about states deciding to do things it is also possible for very, very powerful and sophisticated private entities to do things as well”.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Brussels airport said Collins Aerospace had not yet confirmed the system was secure again. On Monday, 40 of its 277 departing flights and 23 of its 277 arriving services were cancelled.</p> <p>A Heathrow spokesperson said the “vast majority of flights at Heathrow are operating as normal, although check-in and boarding for some flights may take slightly longer than usual”.</p> <p>They added: “This system is not owned or operated by Heathrow, so while we cannot resolve the IT issue directly, we are supporting airlines and have additional colleagues in the terminals to assist passengers.”</p> <p>Heathrow said passengers should check the status of their flight before travelling to the airport and to “arrive no earlier than three hours for long-haul flights and two hours for short-haul”.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Dublin airport said it was not expecting any cancellations on Monday because of the IT problems but would not rule it out. On Sunday, Aer Lingus said it was “significantly impacted” by the problem.</p> <p>RTX said on Saturday it was working to fix the problem as soon as possible, and that the incident affected its Muse software.</p> <p>The attack has highlighted the risks around airports’ reliance on suppliers for critical technology. The European Commission said on Saturday that it was closely monitoring the incident, and that “current signs do not indicate a widespread or severe attack”.</p> <p>Shares in some airlines fell in early trading on Monday, including the British Airways owner, IAG, which fell by 1.2%, while easyJet fell by 1.4% and Wizz Air by 1.1%.</p> <p>The incident is the latest in a series of severe cyber-attacks. This month<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/20/jaguar-land-rover-hack-factories-cybersecurity-jlr"> </a>the British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover said a cyber incident <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/20/jaguar-land-rover-hack-factories-cybersecurity-jlr">forced it to freeze production</a>, while earlier this year an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/inside-the-marks-and-spencer-cyber-attack-chaos">attack on the retailer Marks &amp; Spencer</a> cost it hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>
