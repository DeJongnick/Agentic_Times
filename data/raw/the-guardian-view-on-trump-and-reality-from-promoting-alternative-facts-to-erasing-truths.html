<p>What does the public need to know? The Trump White House boasts of being the most transparent administration in history – though commentators <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/new-revelations-us-signal-leak-claims-doubt-yemen">have suggested</a> that the inadvertent leak of military plans to a journalist may have happened because senior figures were using messaging apps such as Signal to avoid oversight. Last week, it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/jfk-assassination-files-released-trump">released thousands of pages of documents</a> on John F Kennedy’s assassination. Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/23/trump-jfk-assassination-classified-files">declared </a>that Kennedy’s family and the American people “deserve transparency and truth”.</p> <p>Strikingly, this stated commitment to sharing information comes as his administration defunds data collection and erases existing troves of knowledge from government websites. The main drivers appear to be the desire to remove “woke” content and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites">global heating data</a>, and the slashing of federal spending. Information resources are both the target and collateral damage. Other political factors may be affecting federal records too. Last month, Mr Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/trump-fires-national-archives-chief-00203246">sacked the head of the National Archives</a> without explanation, after grumbling about the body’s involvement in the justice department’s investigation into his handling of classified documents.</p> <p>The impact is already painfully evident. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/trump-noaa-cuts-climate">Cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> have affected not only climate records but also an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2025/mar/26/extreme-weather-risk-tool-fema-trump">extreme weather risk tool</a>. The purge’s results are absurd as well as damaging. A webpage on the Enola Gay, the aircraft that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, appears to have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/military-images-trump-dei">marked for deletion</a> because it was&nbsp;mistaken&nbsp;for a reference to LGBTQ+ issues.</p> <p>Yet the disparity between the data dump on the Kennedy assassination and the removal of other material is not a contradiction. It speaks volumes about the administration’s approach to truth and knowledge, which it regards as contingent and a matter of convenience. (Tellingly, it is also <a href="https://lithub.com/trump-is-trying-to-destroy-libraries/">axing</a> the body that provides most federal funding to libraries.)</p> <p>The 1963 presidential assassination is not only an event around which multiple theories circle but one that helped feed a broader culture of conspiracy theorising and distrust in authority. That has metastatised to the bizarre and extreme claims embraced and even promoted by Mr Trump or figures around him, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-obama-birth-certificate-clinton">birtherism</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/22/pizzagate-conspiracy-theorist-prison-sentence-washington">Pizzagate</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/25/qanon-conspiracy-theory-explained-trump-what-is">QAnon</a>. These increasingly fantastical narratives have had real-world consequences. Facts, science and rationality itself are under attack.</p> <p>In his first term, Mr Trump’s aides shamelessly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/22/donald-trump-kellyanne-conway-inauguration-alternative-facts">promoted “alternative facts”</a> while decrying actual facts as “fake news”. The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.6f5e63fbef2c">tallied more than 30,000 false or misleading claims</a> over those four years. This time round, his administration is removing existing sources of information. Websites, datasets and other information <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/dcd-pages-trump-public-health">vanished from federal health websites</a> – such as that for the Centers for Disease Control – last month, though some has since reappeared. One scientist <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5286577/researcher-calls-out-trump-administration-for-a-digital-book-burning">called</a> it “a digital book burning”. The Union of Concerned Scientists <a href="https://www.ucs.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/FINAL_NOAA_signon_with_names.pdf">has warned</a> that “critically important science conducted at many US agencies, institutions, and universities [is] under increasing assault”.</p> <p>Ad hoc preservation of essential national information and records is usually the work of those faced with the destructive force of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/08/ukraine-digital-history/">foreign invasions</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/28/book-smugglers-timbuktu-charlie-english-review">jihadist insurgencies</a> or dictators. But as this bonfire blazes, a motley but committed array of individuals – “nerds who care”, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-data-hoarders-resisting-trumps-purge">in the words of one</a> – are fighting back by preserving data before it is deleted. Their admirable effort to&nbsp;defend&nbsp;the&nbsp;truth&nbsp;deserves support.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
