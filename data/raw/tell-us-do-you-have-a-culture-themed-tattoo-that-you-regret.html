<p>Do you have a music tattoo that you regret? We’d like to hear about the music-themed ink that you’ve fallen out of love with – whether it’s a portrait, a famous line or a logo.</p> <p>Was it a band who changed the direction of their music? A film by a director who started spouting opinions or misbehaved in a way you didn’t agree with? A club logo you got tatted while drunk in Ibiza? Or was it a teenage favourite TV show you grew out of? Tell us all about it below.</p> <h2><strong>This Community callout closed on 08 October 2025.</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>You can contribute to open Community callouts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-community-team">here</a> or Share a story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/sep/02/guardianwitness-send-us-a-story">here</a>.</strong></p></li> </ul>
