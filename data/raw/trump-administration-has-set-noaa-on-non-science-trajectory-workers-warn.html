<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has shunted one of the US federal government’s top scientific agencies onto a “non-science trajectory”, workers warn, that threatens to derail decades of research and leave the US with “air that’s not breathable and water that’s not drinkable”.</p> <p>Workers and scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) are warning of the drastic impacts of cuts at the agency on science, research, and efforts to protect natural resources.</p> <p>“The problems are still there. We still have harmful algal blooms, we still have fisheries that are collapsing, waters you can’t swim in. These problems don’t go away because we fired all the people who were trying to solve a problem,” said one Noaa veteran, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “How do you save the arms and legs or the feet and hands when the core is dying?”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/23/americans-air-pollution">Nearly half of Americans breathing in unsafe levels of air pollutants – report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The longtime research scientist with more than 20 years at Noaa has taken early retirement. “I left because it was just so demoralizing and fearful and scary,” they said.</p> <p>Trump administration officials are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/climate/noaa-research-budget-cuts.html">seeking</a> to abolish the scientific research division at Noaa, the Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (Oar) office. It is the latest of a series of cuts at the agency that began the second Trump administration with <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/about-our-agency">12,000 employees</a> around the world, including more than 6,700 engineers and scientists.</p> <p>The cuts are disrupting the collection of data sets, including recordings of global temperatures in the air and ocean, and that data cannot be replaced, said the Noaa veteran.</p> <p>The dismantling of Noaa, they said, would harm work in many areas, from finding solutions to combat harmful algae and improving sustainable fisheries to work on new medicines and industrial products and collecting information for disaster preparation.</p> <p>“We can look at other countries that are actively making these mistakes, where they have air that’s not breathable and water that’s not drinkable,” they said. “I think it’s done. I think this is done. The enemies are in the gate. I don’t see any indication so far of anyone stopping it. They’re just letting it burn. I honestly don’t understand how US science will recover.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/noaa-firings-trump">More than 800</a> probationary employees at the agency were fired, reinstated, then refired this month.

Morale is extremely bad.”</p> <p>The attrition of scientists and management at Noaa is effectively undermining the agency’s ability to sustainably manage fisheries and identify and recover endangered species, he said.</p> <p>“The agency is essentially, openly hostile to their mission and their people,” Kardos added. “A lot of this seems to be related to deregulation. The agency is responsible for the Endangered Species Act for <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species-directory/threatened-endangered">marine species</a> and one way to hamstring the act without repealing it is to get rid of the scientists who help to implement it.”</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>They’re just letting it burn.

Knowing bad news doesn’t create the bad news. It lets you be prepared to take actions that may let you avoid the worst consequences,” the Noaa scientist at Oar added on the Trump appointees and the authority they are being given over scientific decisions.</p> <p>“Pretending that our resources are inexhaustible doesn’t make them inexhaustible,” they added. “I don’t think people understand the arrogance of thinking: ‘Hey, I think I understand this, even though I know nothing about it.’ This whole antithesis to experts, I don’t understand it. Would you want to do that with your own personal health? Why would you do it with any kind of complex system?”</p> <p>Noaa and the Department of Commerce did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>
