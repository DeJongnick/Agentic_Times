<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tim-wilson">Tim Wilson</a> has a long-held bet against the national sharemarket.</p> <p>The Liberal MP’s register of interests, disclosed in August after his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/31/tim-wilson-takes-back-victorian-seat-of-goldstein-from-zoe-daniel-by-175-votes-recount-confirms">tight victory for the seat of Goldstein</a> at the federal election, shows Wilson has a leveraged investment that profits when the benchmark ASX 200 falls.</p> <p>It is unusual for a politician to bet against the sharemarket, given they would profit during a selldown, which could be seen as a vote of confidence against the economy.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/03/australian-politicians-reveal-their-housing-portfolios-with-some-owning-as-many-as-six-homes">Australian politicians reveal their housing portfolios, with some owning as many as six homes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The product, the BetaShares Australian Equities Strong Bear Complex, uses gearing to magnify gains, and losses, with a 1% fall in the ASX generating a gain of up to 2.75%.</p> <p>It is known as an inverse exchange traded fund.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the shadow minister for small business said Wilson originally “bought these shares as a hedge during Covid, but has kept them because of the poor economic policies of the Albanese government”.</p> <p>The spokesperson would not disclose the size of the investment, other than commenting that it is “less than the value of the subsidies the Teals voted to give to coal and gas companies”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Short positions can be used as a hedge against an investor’s broader portfolio to protect gains made in other investments.</p> <p>During times of volatility, investors may utilise a leveraged short rather than crystallise a capital gain by selling their primary investment.</p> <p>Wilson’s short position, however, isn’t typical.</p> <p>Phillip Bures, a senior financial planner with Nestworth Financial Strategists, said investors usually use such products over short periods to protect portfolios from market downturns.</p> <p>“Typically, it’s a very short-term instrument held for less than a year,” Bures said.</p> <p>“If he’s held it for that long period of time, he would have lost quite a bit of money on that product.”</p> <p>Wilson first entered the federal parliament in 2016. He lost his seat in 2022 and regained it in 2025.</p> <p>The MP’s past register of interests shows that he entered the short trade around February 2020, which coincided with a then record high of Australia’s benchmark ASX 200 index.</p> <p>Shorting is an investment strategy designed to make money when stocks sell off.</p> <p>In early 2020, as the Covid virus spread, global stock markets became jittery, sparking huge falls, including on the ASX, reminiscent of the 1987 stock market crash.</p> <p>If Wilson had sold the product at the end of March 2020, he would have doubled his money, according to an analysis of its performance.</p> <p>But it has since gone on to be a poor investment.</p> <p>As governments around the world stimulated their pandemic-hit economies, share markets surged, including in Australia. Markets have rallied again over the past two years, buoyed by the boom in artificial intelligence technology, leading to recent record highs.</p> <p>Wilson’s BetaShares investment is now down more than 70% from those early 2020 levels.</p> <p>His register of interests also records an investment in an international equity index fund and micro-investing platform, along with a residential and investment property.</p> <p>Recent analysis by Guardian Australia found that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/03/australian-politicians-reveal-their-housing-portfolios-with-some-owning-as-many-as-six-homes">more than half the politicians in federal parliament own investment properties or multiple homes</a>, with at least 50 receiving rental income as landlords.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
