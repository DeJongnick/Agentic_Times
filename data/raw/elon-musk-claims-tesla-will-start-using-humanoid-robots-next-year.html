<p>The Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, has claimed the company will produce “genuinely useful” humanoid robots to start working in its factories next year.</p> 
<p>The world’s richest person, who has a penchant for making overambitious claims on social media, posted on his platform X, formerly Twitter, that he also hoped to expand into “high production” mode to make robots with a humanlike form available sell to other companies in 2026.</p>

  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tesla will have genuinely useful humanoid robots in low production for Tesla internal use next year and, hopefully, high production for other companies in 2026</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1815329637188202550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2024</a>

<p>Musk, who owns X and is also the boss of SpaceX, has previously made bold claims about when the robot, called Optimus, would be ready for commercial use. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/20/humanoid-tesla-bot-likely-to-launch-next-year-says-elon-musk?ref=upstract.com&amp;curator=upstract.com&amp;utm_source=upstract.com">In 2021</a>, the billionaire, estimated by Forbes to be worth $250bn (£194bn), said he expected the mechanoid to be ready for use in Tesla factories the following year.</p>

<p>Optimus is about 1.7 metres tall and weighs 56kg; it is designed to do “boring, repetitious and dangerous” work. The name is an allusion to Optimus Prime, the powerful and benevolent leader of the Autobots in the Transformers media franchise.</p> 
<p>At a Tesla AI Day event in 2021 to launch the humanoid robot, at the time dubbed the “Tesla Bot”, Musk hosted a bizarre demonstration featuring an actor in a bodysuit who proceeded to breakdance to a soundtrack of electronic dance music.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/30/tesla-optimus-humanoid-robot-elon-musk-ai-day">another AI Day event</a> in 2022, Musk – who has claimed Tesla’s robot business will one day be worth more than its cars – demonstrated a prototype of the robot that walked on stage and waved to the audience.</p> 
<p>A video of the robot carrying a box, watering plants and moving metal bars in the carmaker’s factory was shown.</p> 
<p>Musk has said previously his aim is for the robots to be mass-produced and cost less than $20,000 each.</p> 
<p>Optimus is not the only Musk project to be running behind his initial projections. In 2019, he said he felt “very confident” Tesla would have self-driving taxis on the road the following year.</p> 
<p>Earlier this year, he said the model would be unveiled on 8 August, but it looks likely to be delayed after Musk said he had requested a change to the front of the vehicle.</p>
