<p>A federal jury in Texas on Monday cleared five supporters of Donald Trump but found one driver liable in a civil trial over a so-called “Trump Train” that surrounded a Biden-Harris campaign bus on a busy highway days before the 2020 election.</p> <p>The two-week trial in a federal courthouse in Austin centered on whether the actions of the “Trump Train” participants amounted to political intimidation. Among those onboard the bus was Wendy Davis, the former Democratic lawmaker, who testified she feared for her life while a convoy of Trump supporters boxed in the bus along Interstate 35.</p> <p>The jury found that a San Antonio man violated the Ku Klux Klan Act, but cleared the other defendants of liability.</p> <p>Eliazar Cisneros, a navy veteran, was ordered to pay the bus driver, Tim Holloway, $10,000 in compensatory damages. It also levied $30,000 in punitive damages against Cisneros which will be shared among the plaintiffs.</p> <p>Plaintiffs in the lawsuit had alleged they were terrorised and intimidated for more than 90 minutes on 20 October 2020, as they took a bus tour canvassing for the Democratic ticket in the final days of the election in Texas as they travelled from San Antonio to Austin.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/senate-races-elections-to-watch">The key US Senate races that could determine who controls the chamber</a> </p> </aside>  <p>About 40 vehicles flying Make America Great Again flags encircled the bus, trying to run it off the road and playing what the suit claims was a “madcap game of highway ‘chicken’”.</p> <p>No criminal charges were filed against the six Trump supporters who were sued by Davis and two others onboard the bus.
