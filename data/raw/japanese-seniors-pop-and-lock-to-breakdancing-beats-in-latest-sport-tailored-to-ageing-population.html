<p>Head spins and monkey flips are noticeable by their absence. But in their place there is a lot of laughter and a thumping beat, along with the occasional grimace and yelp of frustration.</p> <p>The 10 people – wearing bright orange and green T-shirts that mark them out as members of Ara Style Senior – do not belong to the demographic you would normally associate with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/14/young-stars-uk-breakdancing-olympics-paris-2024-kid-karam-bgirl-roxy-shortbread">breakdancing</a>. Their average age hovers just below 70, and the oldest is 74.</p> <p>But on a hot afternoon in an eastern Tokyo suburb, amid nervous smiles and initial timing issues, the group ends with a perfectly executed pose the dance’s originators in 1970s New York neighbourhoods would probably agree is not too shabby at all.</p> <p>Senior breaking is one of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/02/japan-ageing-footballers-over-80s-league-soccer-for-life-tokyo">growing category of sports</a> tailored to Japan’s large <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/19/fear-older-future-japan-south-korea-birth-fertility-rates-population">population of older people</a> who, thanks to the country’s extraordinary longevity statistics, are determined to keep popping and locking for as long as their bodies will allow.</p>    <p>“At first I thought, there was no way I could breakdance at my age,” says 69-year-old Hitomi Oda. “And of course, we can’t do anything extreme, but it’s fun just to do the easy moves and get your body working.”</p> <p>These superannuated b-girls and b-boys, who meet twice a month at a community centre in the capital’s Edogawa ward, have the organisers of this summer’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games-2024">Paris Olympics</a>, and former breaking national champion Yusuke Arai to thank for this novel approach to fitness in their later years.</p> <p>“Some of my mother’s friends told her they were interested in learning how to breakdance, and when it was chosen as an Olympic sport, I thought, ‘Why not give it a go?’” Arai tells the Guardian ahead of a recent class. “There was a time when no one took much notice of breaking, and people said it wasn’t a proper sport, so the Olympics are a great opportunity.”</p>    <p>The 39-year-old tailors his class to bodies that may not be as supple as the children he has been teaching for almost a decade. “You have to lower the hurdles to make it possible for older people to do the moves, so I begin with a focus on easy moves using the top half of the body,” says Arai.</p> <p>“If people feel comfortable about trying something slightly more difficult, we start to move around the floor.”</p> <p>The keen amateurs being put through their paces are part of a strong Japanese tradition in breaking, which will make its Olympic debut in Paris, three years after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a>’s athletes excelled at another new street-inspired Olympic sport – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jul/25/olympic-skateboarding-yuto-horigome-nyjah-houston">skateboarding</a> – when it appeared at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games-2020">pandemic-delayed Games</a> in Tokyo.</p> <p>The country’s four-member breakdancing team – including Ayumi Fukushima, a 41-year-old former kindergarten teacher, 25-year-old Ami Yuasa and Shigeyuki “Shigekix” Nakarai, 22 – will be among its medal hopefuls in Paris.</p> <p>The class is just a few minutes old when the dancers, faces flushed from stretches and warm-up exercises, take the first of several breathers. The genteel approach works: since the classes started last year, not a single dancer has so much as sprained an ankle.</p> <p>A few have backgrounds in other forms of dance, but most had never tried breaking until a combination of Olympic excitement and gentle peer pressure brought them through Arai’s door. Now they are converts, practising together between sessions with the help of YouTube tutorials.</p> <p>The class ends with a meticulously rehearsed routine that combines toprocks and floor moves and, as its signoff, a baby freeze the dancers are asked to re-create multiple times by a visiting Japanese TV crew.</p>    <p>“The rhythm and the perseverance mean it stimulates your brain as well as your body,” says Kazuharu Sakuma, the only male dancer, who is here taking a trial class.</p> <p>The 71-year-old says he will be back. “It’s not like you have to memorise the moves … you just do them two or three times and you realise, ‘yes, I can actually do this’. That’s when it becomes really enjoyable. It’s also great for general fitness … I’m hoping it will make it easier to walk up stairs.”</p> <p>Class regular Takako Mizutani removes her trucker cap and pronounces herself “not in the least bit tired”.</p> <p>The 71-year-old says she was introduced to the sport via a friend and has never looked back.</p> <p>“It doesn’t matter if you’re not very good at it, it’s a lot of fun and a proper workout,” adds Mizutani, who has a background in jazz dance. “I plan to keep breaking for as long as I can.”</p>
