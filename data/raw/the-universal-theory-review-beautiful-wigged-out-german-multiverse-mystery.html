<p>A work of extraordinary beauty – this is one of the most strikingly photographed films of the year – and knotty complexity, <em>The Universal Theory</em>, directed by Timm Kröger, is a somewhat baffling German-language, arthouse riff on the well-worn concept of multiverses. Largely set in the Swiss Alps in the early 1960s, the story unfolds at a physics symposium at a mountain resort, where Johannes (Jan Bülow), a young postgraduate student, hopes to further his career. Instead, he meets Karin (Olivia Ross), an alluring jazz pianist, and stumbles into a mystery involving a network of underground tunnels, radioactivity and duplicate versions of people. </p> <p>An impenetrable plot doesn’t entirely hold together, but the film is worth a look for fans of wigged-out sci-fi, gorgeous framing and lush, orchestral, Bernard Herrmann-inspired soundtracks.</p> <ul> <li><p>In UK and Irish cinemas</p></li> </ul>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-GKIRngrQ"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fg-GKIRngrQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-GKIRngrQ">Watch a trailer for The Universal Theory</a>.</figcaption> </figure>
