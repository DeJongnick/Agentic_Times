<p>Australia has been accused of undermining its Pacific neighbours in a landmark international legal case after it argued that high-emitting countries are not obliged to act on the climate crisis beyond their commitments under the 2015 Paris agreement.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/02/handful-of-countries-responsible-for-climate-crisis-icj-court-told">the case before the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ)</a>, Vanuatu is leading an argument brought by several Pacific nations and developing states – including Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu – that developed countries have a legal responsibility beyond existing UN frameworks. The case does not specify the names of countries that would fall under the definition of high emitters.</p> <p>The hearing, which began on Monday, follows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/20/from-vanuatu-law-school-to-the-hague-the-fight-to-recognise-climate-harm-in-international-law">years of campaigning</a> by a group of law students from Pacific island countries and a unanimous UN general assembly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/29/united-nations-resolution-climate-emergency-vanuatu">resolution</a> calling on the ICJ to provide an advisory opinion on what obligations states have to tackle climate change and what the legal consequences could be if they don’t. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2024/nov/29/the-cop29-agreement-failed-island-states-now-the-uns-top-court-must-act-on-climate-harm">The Cop29 agreement failed island states.
