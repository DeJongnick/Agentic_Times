Led by King’s 7-18, Australia were able to bowl South Africa out for 97 in Indore, before chasing down the victory target with seven wickets in hand and with 33 overs to spare.</p> <p>The result means Australia will finish the round-robin stage of the ODI tournament undefeated and face hosts India in a semi-final in Mumbai on Thursday. South Africa will face England in the other semi-final, with Saturday’s clash always set to determine top spot on the ladder.</p> <p>In all, the whole affair lasted a little over three hours as King spun a web around South Africa and showed why she is the best wrist spinner in the world right now. King’s figures marked the fifth best by any woman in an ODI, the best by any Australian woman, and the only time a woman has taken seven wickets in a World Cup match.</p> <p><em>- Australian Associated Press</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68fcca4d8f08e0ae8c400e0d" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-25T13:05:31.756Z">2.05pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Tahlia McGrath’s verdict</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>That was good fun!

This gives her the best figures in a Women’s World Cup, as well as the best figures by an Australian woman in ODIs, beating Ellyse Perry (7-22) and her coach Shelley Nitschke (7-24). A hugely impressive spell from the legspinner, South Africa just didn’t have any answers for her today. The opening bowlers Schutt and Garth chipped in with a wicket each, and Gardner picked up one late in the innings.</p> <p>South Africa will be incredibly disappointed with their batting. Wolvaardt got them off to a good start, showing intent and seeming to score with ease early on. But when she chipped one to King off Schutt’s bowling with a pretty unnecessary shot, her team struggled to regather themselves. Only Jafta put up a fight after that, with some nice boundary hitting. But the regularity with which King was picking up wickets made it very difficult to create any momentum and in the end, they couldn’t crack the 100 runs.</p> <p>This chase should not be a concern for the Australians, but stranger things have happened!

Today we’ve got the undefeated defending champions Australia taking on South Africa, who had an absolute horror start to the tournament, ending up all out for 69 against England in their first match. But from there, they have rallied and won their next five games, currently sitting in second on the ladder. They haven’t looked convincing in every moment, but they have done what is needed to win. </p> <p>Australia similarly have had some scratchy wins and got very close to dropping a match on a few occasions, but they have always been able to find someone to dig them out of trouble. Even being forced to play without their captain Alyssa Healy in their last match against England did not cause too many problems, thanks to a stunning partnership from Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner.</p> <p>Today’s game is the last pool match for both teams and while both have secured their semi finals positions, there is still plenty to play for.</p> <p>For Australia, going through the pool rounds undefeated will be the aim, while for South Africa, a win over the reigning world champions would boost their confident going into the elimination rounds and wipe all memories of their disastrous beginning.</p> <p>It’s sure to be a fascinating game, so let’s get into it!</p> </div>   </div>
