<p>Red faces for the Solheim Cup organisers. Red faces for the European team. The next two days of competitive action will clarify whether one, or both, can repair faltering reputations.</p> <p>The 19th staging of this event got off to a highly inauspicious start. Thousands of fans were left in queues for hours after problems with shuttle buses from a public parking lot. What should be a marquee moment for women’s golf, the 1st tee on Solheim Cup Friday, proved a damp squib due to huge gaps in stands. Given big crowds had been anticipated and the last staging of the Solheim Cup, in Spain last year, was a logistical nightmare for spectators this really did constitute an embarrassment. After 8am, with an hour of play already gone, fans arriving at the shuttle area were told they faced a three-hour wait for buses.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/sep/13/solheim-cup-2024-day-one-live">Solheim Cup 2024: day one – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We recognise and deeply apologise to all fans affected by the challenges with shuttling from parking to the golf course,” said the LPGA. “We’ve made significant changes to our transportation system to mitigate these issues moving forward, and we’re working on ways to express our regret to those impacted.” The statement was as inadequate as the scenario it sought to address. Amid angry scenes, many ticket holders had simply turned for home. The Robert Trent Jones Golf Club has staged elite golf competition before, meaning rookie status could not be put forward as mitigation.</p> <p>What those who leapt back into their cars missed was a dominant US performance. Europe’s hopes of lifting the Solheim Cup for a fourth time in succession are already hanging by a thread, at 6-2 behind. Nelly Korda, the world No 1, led from the front for the US. Korda combined with Allisen Corpuz to see off Esther Henseleit and Charley Hull in the opening match of the event. Their foursomes win was by 3&amp;2.</p> <p>Korda was inspired after lunch. Alongside Megan Khang, the Americans were 5up by the time Georgia Hall holed out for Europe’s first birdie of this fourball match at the 9th. Korda proceeded to drive through the green at the par four 10th. At the 12th, Korda’s five-iron approach to the par five finished at tap-in range. The US were six up with six to play, eventually cantering to a 6&amp;4 win. Korda closed with two eagles in her last three holes.</p> <p>A 3-1 foursomes win for the US had all involved 3&amp;2 successes. Korda and Corpuz were first to the clubhouse. Rose Zhang and Lauren Coughlin defeated Céline Boutier and Albane Valenzuela to quickly add a second point for the hosts. Lilia Vu and Sarah Schmelzel rarely looked in danger in opposition to Linn Grant and Carlota Ciganda. Europe’s only response came via Emily Pedersen and Maja Stark, who saw off Ally Ewing and Jennifer Kupcho.</p>    <p>Curiously, Suzann Pettersen described this as a “good morning.” It was, but only in comparison to 2023 when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/sep/22/europe-fight-back-after-worst-possible-solheim-cup-start-but-us-hold-5-3-lead">Europeans found themselves 4-0 down</a> at the same juncture. Recoveries are considerably easier with the backing of a home support. In Virginia, American momentum reverberated through the trees when the galleries eventually thickened.</p> <p>By the afternoon, Barack Obama roared on Stacy Lewis’s team at his home golf club from the opening tee. Perhaps the 44th president of the US had planned to be here for the foursomes but encountered travel difficulties. Either way, Obama’s level of enthusiasm was striking.</p> <p>Pettersen turned to Leona Maguire, surprisingly left out of the foursomes, in partnership with Hall. The plan comprehensively failed, if partly because of the brilliance of Korda and Khang. European cheer arrived in the second match, where the experienced Anna Nordqvist partnered Madelene Sagström for a 6&amp;5 win over Alison Lee and Lexi Thompson. Lee is making her first Solheim appearance since 2015, with Thompson bidding a playing farewell to the contest. The American duo were comprehensively outplayed by the Swedes. Nordqvist, in her ninth Solheim, will surely feature in both Saturday sessions.</p> <p>This proved a rare aberration for those donning stars and stripes. Hull and Grant started promisingly against Andrea Lee and Zhang but were soon swatted aside. From all square after eight, the Americans closed out a 5&amp;4 win.</p> <p>The final match on the course involved Pedersen and Stark, seeking to stem the flow against Coughlin and Schmelzel. There was to be no salvation for Europe as shadows lengthened. The US were never behind at any point in match three, with the margin of victory ultimately 3&amp;2. Lewis had her four-point advantage, which looks hugely ominous for Europe given respective team performances. “Things played out the way we hoped,” said Lewis.</p> <p>“Unfinished business” is the US motto for the week. Another day like this and they will be within touching distance of redemption. A stony-faced Pettersen had been sent back to the drawing board.</p>
