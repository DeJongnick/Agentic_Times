<p>The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday.</p> <p>A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market.</p> <p>The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/20/replacing-liddell-coal-plant-with-clean-energy-13bn-cheaper-analysis">Replacing Liddell coal plant with clean energy $1.3bn cheaper – analysis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself.</p> <p>The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/18/what-is-the-national-energy-guarantee-explainer">a policy</a> that imposes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/17/coalition-balks-on-finkel-target-but-will-unveil-energy-and-emissions-policy">new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees</a> on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020.</p> <p>The policy requires cooperation from the states but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/19/labor-states-wont-solve-pms-political-problems-on-energy-weatherill-says">some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia</a>, have been hostile.</p> <p>Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee.</p> <p>Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources.</p> <p>A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state.</p> <p>The Labor states have also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/14/states-move-towards-clean-energy-but-frydenberg-says-coalition-wont-be-rushed">commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council</a> examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.</p> <p>The lack of agreement has unsettled business groups. A joint statement from 16 business, energy, farmers, trade union and welfare groups has urged governments to collaborate.</p> <p>The joint statement notes the national energy guarantee is “only a concept at this point, with much development required, but we are hopeful that this further work will identify that the proposed mechanism can deliver”.</p> <p>The statement notes pointedly there are “no apparent alternatives at present that are both potentially functional and potentially acceptable to all sides of politics”.</p> <p>It says stakeholders in the community will not agree to “just anything”, and neither should energy ministers, but governments should maintain goodwill and forward momentum.</p> <p>“What the Coag energy council meeting in Hobart this week should do is agree a work plan and full consultation to resolve the many unanswered questions about the guarantee as soon as possible and produce a fully fledged design ready for consideration, agreement and implementation,” the joint statement says.</p> <p>“Without timely progress Australia will see energy costs and emissions increase, threatening our society, environment and economy.”</p> <p>While the states remain to be convinced, and stakeholders are concerned about the current trajectory, Turnbull has declared the new modelling “a wake-up call to Labor and the states”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/20/renewables-could-reliably-contribute-50-to-power-grid-says-alan-finkel">Renewables could reliably contribute 50% to power grid, says Finkel report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“They should work with government to bring down prices, increase reliability and meet our international emission reduction commitments,” the prime minister said. “The independent experts have spoken – our plan will cut power bills and ensure the lights stay on.”</p> <p>The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the new modelling suggested savings for households would be higher than initially forecast.</p> <p>The government released some preliminary estimates of cost impacts of the scheme when it unveiled the national energy guarantee policy last month.</p> <p>The first-run estimates said wholesale prices were expected to decline by 20% to 25% a year between 2020 and 2030 and residential bills would go down “in the order of” $100 to $115 a year over the same period.</p> <p>After stakeholders queried the initial figures, given the lack of detailed modelling, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/19/frydenberg-appeals-to-states-on-energy-but-gives-them-24-hour-deadline">Turnbull government asked the Energy Security Board</a> to model a “least-cost trajectory” assuming an emissions reduction target for electricity of 26% on 2005 levels by 2030, and a “constant target post-2030”.</p> <p>The scope for the modelling included analysis on “an optimised non-linear trajectory” for emissions reduction – which suggests the government in Canberra might look to back-end load emissions reduction commitments in Australia’s electricity sector to the latter half of the decade between 2020 and 2030.</p> <p>The direction on the modelling also suggests the government wants the new reliability and emissions reduction obligations in place by 2019.</p>
