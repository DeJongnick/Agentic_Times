<p><strong>Name:</strong> Cumulative social advantage.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> If it exists, it’s always been there.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Strictly speaking, it looks like everyone else.</p> <p><strong>Everyone else? </strong>You know – the other people around you.</p> <p><strong>Ugh, please. I see enough of them. </strong>Don’t you enjoy the give and take of societal interaction? Making genuine human connections?</p> <p><strong>Honestly, I just want to be left alone for once. With my things. </strong>That may sound appealing, but it’s not good for you.</p> <p><strong>Why not? </strong>Cumulative social advantage is the notion that social relationships are the key to a long and healthy life.</p> <p><strong>What kind of social relationships? </strong>Family ties, emotional support networks, religious participation and community engagement.</p> <p><strong>I knew it: you’re trying to get me to volunteer for something. </strong>It would be to your cumulative social advantage.</p> <p><strong>I’m very busy at the moment. </strong>According to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354625001541">a new study</a>, being socially engaged can have a profound impact on epigenetic ageing.</p> <p><strong>What does that mean? </strong>It can slow changes at the cellular level that are reliable predictors of infirmity, disease and early death.</p> <p><strong>Are you suggesting that being socially engaged will make me live longer? </strong>That’s about the size of it, yes.</p> <p><strong>How would that even work? </strong>The hypothesis suggests that high levels of social interaction reduce your stress response, and the long-term biological consequences – systemic inflammation, cellular ageing – associated with it.</p> <p><strong>What do I have to do? Hand out leaflets, pick up litter or what? </strong>It’s hard to say exactly what type of engagement is the most effective. The study ranked participants’ responses to statements such as: “I enjoy personal and mutual conversations with family members and friends.”</p> <p><strong>So I just need to lie on the questionnaire. </strong>I don’t think it works like that.</p> <p><strong>Listen: I want to live a long time without having to deal with any annoying people. Is that too much to ask? </strong>It probably is, yeah.</p> <p><strong>Is there nothing else I can do? </strong>The study showed that higher education and income levels were also associated with slower epigenetic ageing.</p> <p><strong>So I need to get rich or die trying. </strong>Those have always been the two main options. Now there’s a third: develop a wide-ranging, fully engaged social network.</p> <p><strong>You’re starting to put me off the whole idea of longevity. </strong>Do you want to talk about it over a coffee?</p> <p><strong>No. </strong>I’ll leave you my number in case you change your mind.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “We are a social species that thrives on connection – not just emotionally, but also physically.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “This is so unfair. Why doesn’t closing the curtains and binge-watching TV in bed make you live longer?”</p>
