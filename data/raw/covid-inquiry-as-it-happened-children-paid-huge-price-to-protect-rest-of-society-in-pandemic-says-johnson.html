 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>That’s all from us for today, we’re closing this blog now. Here’s a summary of the main developments from Boris Johnson at the Covid-19 inquiry:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Former prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> told the Covid inquiry that children paid “a huge, huge price to protect the rest of society” when schools were closed to prevent the spread of the virus. He added: “It was an awful, awful thing. As I said, I wish it had been otherwise. I wish we could have found another solution.”</p></li> 
   <li><p>He also added that the way of adjudicating <strong>exam results in England</strong> in the summer of 2020 “let kids down” and “must have been bitterly disappointing to students”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>A central theme of Johnson’s evidence was conflict with the then-education secretary <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong>. Williamson claimed in his earlier evidence to the inquiry that he was finding out about decisions on school closures rather than him and the department being involved, and that Johnson’s decisions and announcements were eroding trust between schools and the Department for Education. Johnson said of Williamson’s evidence: “I’m afraid I don’t remember the details of that.”</p></li> 
   <li><p>Johnson did, however, describe the work of Williamson and the DfE during the pandemic as “heroic”. The <strong>Lib Dems</strong> said this description was “embarrassing” and “an insult to the true heroes of the Covid pandemic: the teachers and doctors, nurses and key workers who put their lives on the line to keep crucial public services going”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>In response to Johnson’s evidence, and that of former ministers, <strong>Save the Children</strong> said: “Evidence to this inquiry has clearly shown that consideration of children’s rights was absent from decision-making. There was no clear mechanism to protect their interests, and no voice for them in the room.”</p></li>

  <p><strong>Liberal Democrat</strong> health spokesperson <strong>Caroline Voaden</strong> has also responded to <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>’s Covid inquiry evidence, in particular addressing the moment when the former prime minister suggested <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong> had made a heroic effort as education secretary during the pandemic. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Johnson should be embarrassed to call Gavin Williamson’s efforts ‘heroic’.</p>

   <p>From duff algorithms that ruined young people’s dreams of further education, to crucial development lost in early years, Johnson’s effort to gloss over his government’s total failure to plan for schools in 2020 is yet another kick in the teeth to the British public.</p>

  <p><strong>Dan Paskins</strong>, executive director of UK impact at <strong>Save the Children UK</strong>, has responded to Boris Johnson’s evidence at the Covid inquiry with a call to embed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into UK law.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary of Boris Johnson's evidence to the UK Covid inquiry</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Appearing before the UK Covid inquiry in London, former prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> has said that lockdown rules were “far too elaborate”, deciding to close schools in January 2021 was “hellishly difficult”, and the consequences of school closures for children and young people had ended up being “on the worst end of my expectations.”</p> 
  <p>However, he insisted that it was impossible to know if a different course of action would have led to a much wider spread of the virus, and that with little known at the beginning of the pandemic about the impact on children of Covid and how the virus transmitted, at times he felt he had “no option” but to close schools.</p> 
  <p>A central theme of Johnson’s evidence was conflict with the then-education secretary <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong>. Williamson claimed in his earlier evidence to the inquiry that he was finding out about decisions on school closures rather than him and the department being involved, and that Johnson’s decisions and announcements were eroding trust between schools and the DfE.</p> 
  <p>Questioning Johnson, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/09/boris-johnson-resigns-as-mp-with-immediate-effect-over-partygate-report">quit as an MP in disgrace in June 2023</a>, <strong>Clair Dobbin KC</strong> sought to inderstand why the DfE appeared unready for school closures, and why Johnson still seemed to be seeking advice to support the idea of keeping schools open right up to the last minute before they were closed.</p>

  <p><strong>Chair Heather Hallett</strong> is asking one final question. She wants to know if <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> thinks a minister for children would have improved the way the impact of the pandemic affected that particular group.</p> 
  <p>Johnson says he has thought about this, but the former prime minister questions the value. He tells the inquiry it would involve “another department, another set of civil servants and so on” and that “we’ve seen already … how fractious and difficult it becomes when different ministerial interests start to collide, and we’ve got quite enough around the table on a subject like this.”</p> 
  <p>Hallett thanks him for his time, and then there is some laughter in the room as Johnson rises to leave as if he has been dismissed, but she hasn’t finished.</p> 
  <p>He says he means no discourtesy, and likens it to when the speaker stands up at the end of PMQs. “You just belt for it” he says. Hallett tells the inquiry it will resume this afternoon, and Johnson can leave.</p>

  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> has been asked questions by <strong>Kate Beattie</strong>, representing organisations that work with disabled people, and <strong>Adam Wagner KC</strong> who represents clinically vulnerable families.</p> 
  <p>The thrust of both their questions is to get him to put on record what provision, consideration or care the prime minister took in school closure decisions for these specific groups. Johnson is nothing if not an experienced politician in this kind of situation, and he manages to answer both sets of questions with a lot of words that shed very little light.</p>

  <p><strong>Sam Jacobs</strong> is asking questions on behalf of the <strong>TUC</strong>, and brings up the topic of <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>’s Eat Out To Help Out. He suggests it was an example of the government not using its “risk budget” to facilitate school attendance, but instead “encouraged significant numbers to socialise in restaurants.”</p> 
  <p>In reply, <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> says “Well, it’s a very fair question. I know there’s been a lot of shot and shell directed at Eat Out to Help Out over the last few years.”</p> 
  <p>He says according to his recollection, the policy was known of by scientific advisers, and the problem is “I think that’s the terrible reality of all these interventions is we don’t know the individual value of any of them.”</p> 
  <p>He continues by saying “I think that it was felt at the time that given where the R was, and the state of the economy it was reasonable to proceed with Eat Out to Help Out.”</p> 
  <p>Jacobs asks whether he would question that in retrospect. The former prime minister replies “Well, lots of people have.”</p> 
  <p>Eat Out to Help Out was launched in August 2020. It allowed diners to claim 50% off more than 160m meals at a cost to the Treasury of about £850m. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/132/643/1200/6382847?login=false">A study carried out by Thiemo Fetzer</a>, an economist at the University of Warwick, suggested it drove new Covid-19 infections up by between 8 and 17%.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Johnson: intricacy of policies like 'the rule of six' were 'far too elaborate' during lockdown</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Steve Broach KC</strong> is representing children’s rights organisations. He is asking <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> about rules around children playing and if in England they were systematically treated as adults.</p> 
  <p>The former prime minister says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think that you’re making a very fair point about the rules generally. I think that looking back on it all, the whole lockdowns, the intricacy of the rules, the rule of six, the complexity, particularly for children, I think we probably did go too far, and it was, it was far too elaborate. Maybe we could have found a way of of exempting children. It’s a very fair point.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Broach cites examples of people stopping children from taking outside exercise and play. Johnson says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’m very sorry to hear that, if there was excessively officious enforcement of rules or misunderstanding of rules by those in authority, then that’s plainly wrong. Children should have been, as my understanding the rules, children should have been allowed to exercise outdoors.</p>

  <p><strong>Clair Dobbin KC</strong> says she is coming to her last question on this topic. She says <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>’s evidence suggests one of his biggest anxieties now is being unsure about the extent to which non-pharmaceutical interventions – like school closures – saved lives compared to the damage caused.</p> 
  <p>The former prime minister says: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Given the detriment, given the suffering, given the damage, was there another way of reducing the budget of risk? Was there? Was there another thing we could have done? Was there another shot we could have played? And I don’t know the answer to that, nor can I answer.</p> 
   <p>Nor can I really be certain what would have happened if we’d gone with what Gavin [Williamson] and the DfE wanted on 4 January 2021, and kept going, what would really have happened? I can’t know. None of us can know.</p> 
   <p>But the predictions were really grim.</p>

  <p>The inquiry is now talking about education recovery commissioner <strong>Kevan Collins</strong>, who resigned after the government did not adopt his suggested costed plans for providing education support for children who had missed out on schooling.</p> 
  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> attempts to make the case to the inquiry that he did not believe the proposal offered value for money, and possibly slightly unhelpfully for the current Conservative leadership, suggests that the current government debt situation has been caused not <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong>’ policies, but by the money Johnson spent during the pandemic. He told the inquiry:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>So I had to make a difficult choice, and not for not the first time. We just spent £480bn already on Covid. The country, even now, is struggling with a huge debt burden, which is putting up the cost of living, interest rates, for everybody in this country.</p> 
   <p>Just to throw another £10bn on something for which the evidential basis is not very strong, is not something that you should normally be be doing.</p> 
   <p>The difficulty is that we have a very – certainly post-Covid – a very constrained fiscal position. And we have to … the government today has to be mindful of the bond markets. Why is Rachel Reeves continually talking about putting taxes up? It is because if she doesn’t, the international finance will mark Britain down … and if she’s seen to spend too much.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He describes Collins as “a passionate educationalist who whose life is dedicated to trying to secure more more funding from government” who put a plan on the table “with a big number attached to it.”</p> 
  <p>Johnson says “I’m in a different position. I share [Collins’] desire, but I I’m limited by the position we’re in. And also by the need to be mindful of taxpayer value and, frankly, to get the kids the best outcome.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Clair Dobbin KC</strong> reads out some evidence to the inquiry from a parent, describing how their son became suicidal after feeling they had missed out on a career opportunity and key moments of their life during lockdown and school closures.</p> 
  <p>She asks former prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> “Do you think the consequences [of school closures] proved to be worse than you anticipated?”</p> 
  <p>Stumbling over his answer slightly, he tells the Covid inquiry:</p>

   <p>That’s a good question. I think that they were certainly as bad as … they were certainly on the, on the … worst end of my expectations … some of the things that happened.</p>

  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> suggests he would “respectfully” disagree with <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong>’s assessment in his evidence. Williamson told the inquiry that he believed schools were closed in January 2021 not because it would have a significant impact on infection rates, but because the government had to be seen to using all the levers at its disposal.</p> 
  <p>Johnson says “It grieved everybody to have to do it. It is the last thing I wanted to do.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Clair Dobbin KC</strong> suggests Williamson characterised it as a panic decision, and likened it to smashing a Ming vase on the floor for effect. Johnson again says he respectfully disagrees with that assessment.</p> 
  <p>He says “but the numbers were very difficult to argue with”, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The problem with bringing the schools back, as everybody knows, is that there’s a delay. Because when the virus starts circulating in schools, there’s a delay between between the kids contracting it and then passing it on, and then the the adults being infected. And so you’re storing up potentially very, very big problems.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>On the conflict with Williamson, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It was clear to me that because of [the alpha variant], the balance of the argument had shifted. I had no option. I had no option, given the facts as they presented themselves that day. I felt I had no option but to close down and or to prevent the reopening of schools.</p>

  <p>She continues to say that Williamson claims in his testimony he told Johnson 85% of schools had opened, but then by lunchtime he was receiving a call to say schools must close. Johnson says he understands how that would be “frustrating” for a secretary of state.</p> 
  <p>Johnson goes on to say “And I think you’re looking at the reality of the way things have to run in government, and particularly during a pandemic.</p> 
  <p>“Gavin rightly owned the interests of schools and young people he had to promote. I had the problem of trying to balance the interests of the entire country, and every single potential Covid victim, and it was hellishly difficult.”</p>

  <p><strong>Chair Heather Hallett</strong> makes a rare interventions, asking Johnson “Why was it that the decision had to wait? That primary schools opened 4 January and then closed that night? Could the decision not have been taken earlier?”</p> 
  <p>Johnson replies:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Of course, it could have been taken earlier, and it would have looked better and have felt less bumpy to everybody had it been taken earlier. Of course, that’s right. But at the time it wasn’t as obvious to me as it seems now. At the time I was still very much divided.</p>

  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> is being shown some minutes now, and <strong>Clair Dobbin KC</strong> is pressing him on, if the prime minister was expecting schools to re-open with a mass testing programme in place on 4 January, why was he asking “fundamental questions” about how the plan was going to work on 28 December.</p> 
  <p>“To the best of my memory,” he says, “That doesn’t mean that I thought that the plan was necessarily undeliverable. I wanted to make sure that we belt and braced it.”</p> 
  <p>He said of the idea of mass testing of secondary pupils: “I didn’t think it was such an unreasonable thing to ask. I know it was onerous, but I believe they could.”</p> 
  <p>Dobbin then cites evidence from permanent secretary at the DfE, <strong>Susan Acland-Hood</strong>, who told the inquiry she felt the government was asking something deeply unreasonable of schools. “In other words,” Dobbin puts it to Johnson, “the teachers were there to teach the children. They weren’t there to implement a mass testing regime in secondary schools.”</p> 
  <p>Johnson defends the position by saying that vaccines were yet to come down the track, and “in the second half of 2020 that was the only shot we had. Mass testing was the only way through for the country that I that I could see.”</p>

  <p><strong>Clair Dobbin KC</strong> has said she now wants to ask questions about the closure of schools in January 2021. She refers to the evidence of <strong>Susan Acland-Hood</strong>, who had become permanent secretary at the DfE. Acland-Hood said during in Decomber 2020 there was an increasing “ask” from government for mass testing.</p> 
  <p>Former prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> said “it’s absolutely correct that I wanted to see mass testing in schools as part of the way of getting schools open.”</p> 
  <p>Dobbin is now trying to probe where the extra workforce was coming from to put in extra testing, and alludes to conflict between the health secretary and education secretary.</p> 
  <p>All this was by-the-by in a way, because the rising alpha variant level was going to change the scenario. Johnson says “the documents I’ve just looked at to refresh my memory, suggested that really the penny sort of started to drop on the 22nd [of December] but yes, I think it was very clear by the 28th.”</p>

  <p>For the first time in this morning’s session former prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> seems particularly irritated with the questioning, and replies to <strong>Clair Dobbin KC</strong> quite sharply, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>All I would say is that, you know, you try coming up with a system to give a fair exam result for people when they can’t sit exams. It’s not easy. OK? That’s all I would say.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Dobbin takes it in her stride, saying “It’s really the broader question, Mr Johnson. The point has been made by other witnesses in module eight that you didn’t, for example, have press conferences where you took questions from children or spoke to children.”</p> 
  <p>She contrasts that with other political leaders. Nicola Sturgeon, for example, did videos specifically aimed at children.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Johnson: department for education was doing 'pretty heroic job'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> is asked whether the exam result fiasco in England “raised question marks about the whole leadership of the Department for Education.”</p> 
  <p>He takes a while to answer this, slowly saying “I certainly thought that the public outcry, the level of disappointment, pain, on the part of individual candidates was … it was awful. And it’s fair to say that I, yes, of course, I thought about whether there was a need to respond to that by changing people’s jobs and so on and so forth. Of course, it was really undermining of public confidence this issue.”</p> 
  <p>He is then shown what he describes as “that particular intemperate message” from the time in which he said “We need a plan for the Department of Education. We need a [new] perm secretary. We need better ministers, and, quite frankly, we need an agenda of reform. We can’t go on like this. I’m thinking of going into No 10 and firing people.”</p> 
  <p>Clair Dobbin KC then says to him that he did replace the permanent secretary, but not the minister – Gavin Williamson. Should he have done, he is asked. Johnson replies:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>You know, I think if I look back at the general handling of my beloved colleagues over the three years or three-and-a-bit years I was in government, I can think of all sorts of changes I might have made, but I don’t think there’s any point in speculating about it now.</p> 
   <p>Except, you know, I think that on the whole, given the difficulties that we faced, I think that the department under Gavin did a pretty heroic job in in trying to cope with Covid.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Johnson: exam results system in England in summer 2020 'let kids down'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Former prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> has said that the way of adjudicating exam results in England in the summer of 2020 “let kids down” and “must have been bitterly disappointing to students”.</p> 
  <p>He told the Covid inquiry:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>[We hoped] there some way we could keep exams alive, but we couldn’t, and so we had to find a way of of adjudicating on the on the academic achievement of the kids that didn’t involve an exam.</p> 
   <p>And Ofqual came up with this system. I was not expert enough to comment on it, on whether it was viable or or not, but plainly, it let down a lot of kids whose grades didn’t reflect their their abilities and their their achievements.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>There is more probing of conflict between central government and Gavin Williamson’s DfE. Johnson is asked by <strong>Clair Dobbin KC</strong> was he not concerned that after Scottish exam results came out, the then-education secretary Williamson had not made enough planning for what might happen in England.</p> 
  <p>“Amongst the things I regret, and I take responsibility for, is that we got the wrong initial model for how to have a substitute exam. What I would say in in our defence is it wasn’t easy to come up with the right model,” he says.</p> 
  <p>Johnson at one point lets out a somewhat exasperated sigh as Gavin Williamson’s name comes up again.</p> 
  <p>Dobbin says to Johnson that “the whole thing was a disaster”. She is specifically talking about the way the exam results were handled. Johnson tries to broaden it out, answering:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I certainly think that if you mean, was Covid a disaster? Yes. And was the whole loss of education a disaster? Yes. Was the loss of exams a disaster? Yes. Was the disappointment, anger, frustration of a large number of kids, the additional frustration a disaster? Yes. It was. But it has to be seen in the context of us trying to deal with a much, much bigger disaster.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Johnson: children were 'paying a huge price' to protect the rest of society</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> is now being asked “whether children’s interests were sufficiently well represented, when you made those decisions.”</p> 
  <p>It is being put to him by <strong>Clair Dobbin KC</strong> that the DfE did not have a “seat at the table” at crucial moments.</p> 
  <p>She is trying to understand from the prime minister if decisions were being made at cabinet, or decisions were being made by Johnson and then communicated to ministers. <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong> in his evidence appears to have implied that he was blind-sided by an annoucement about primary schools reopening.</p> 
  <p>Johnson speaks about the sacrifice children were making, telling the Covid inquiry:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It felt to me as though children who are not particularly vulnerable to Covid were paying a huge, huge price to protect the rest of society. And it was an awful, awful thing. As I said, I wish it had been otherwise. I wish we could have found another solution.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Johnson has a slight dig at Williamson’s evidence, saying “I’m afraid I don’t remember the details of that. It seems a bit paradoxical to be criticised both for wanting to close schools and wanting to get them open.”</p> 
  <p>Williamson contended in his evidence that Johnson had undermined confidence in the DfE from schools, because the prime minister was flagging to families and parents that kids could go back to school, when schools knew that because of social distancing requirements they could not cope with full schools. </p> 
  <p>This passage seems rather bogged down in the personal political gripes between Johnson and Williamson.</p>

  <p><strong>Clair Dobbin KC</strong> is pressing former prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> on whether there was a systemic failure of planning on behalf of the government, using school closures as the example.</p>

  <p>Johnson insists “my impression was that they’d done a lot of of work” at the DfE. Dobbin is asking “what work was it that you thought was being done in the background to prepare schools for the eventuality of having to close? What was it you saw that gave you the confidence that this planning was going on in the background?”</p> 
  <p>He says “I think people responded pretty heroically to the challenge. You say so late in the day, but so late in the day is, of course, a phrase that is only open, or judgment only open, to people who are operating with hindsight. We didn’t know how Covid was being transmitted. We didn’t know to what extent children and young people were affected by it.”</p> 
  <p>Dobbin responds “You’ve accepted that the implications of closing schools were enormous for Almost every school age child in this country. Correct? You must accept that that therefore put a responsibility on government to grasp the nettle and really think about what it needed to do if schools were, in fact, going to close to most children.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Clair Dobbin KC</strong> is questioning the former prime minister. She is counsel to the Covid Inquiry. She leads its work in Northern Ireland and, separately, its work in relation to children.</p> 
  <p>She has opened by asking about <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong>’s evidence which suggested there had been very little preparation for the closure of schools. She says his evidence was that “he didn’t seek assessment of the impact of school closures, and nor did he seek to develop planning for mass school closures because, and these were the words he used in his oral evidence, the steer I was hearing – whether it was in cabinet or anything else – was to keep things open, not about closing things.”</p> 
  <p>Former prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> disagrees, saying “I not sure I agree with the the idea that there was no planning for school closures, because if you look at the sequence from February onwards, it’s clear that sage is talking about the possibility the cabinet is discussing it in in March. Certainly, I remember the subject coming up repeatedly.”</p> 
  <p>He is shown a statement from the permanent secretary for the Department of Education at the time – <strong>Jonathan Slater</strong> – giving evidence that there was no contingency plan for closing schools before 17 March 2020.</p> 
  <p>Johnson suggests Slater should “have picked up from discussions that would be going on from February onwards, that there was work to be done in this area.”</p>

  <p>It is difficult to know in advance how political Johnson’s evidence will be.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Yesterday at the inquiry England’s chief medical officer <strong>Chris Whitty</strong> suggested that at the time decision makers were faced with a series of “very bad” choices, where some of them were “a bit worse and some of them were a lot worse.”</p> 
  <p>He defended closures of school, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What I am confident about saying is that had schools not closed, and based on the evidence we had at the time and I don’t think evidence subsequently has undermined that, the peak of the pandemic would have been higher and that would have had obviously direct effect from deaths from Covid in the first wave, but would have increased the risk of all the indirect effects from health services being be unable to function.</p> 
   <p>So I think not closing schools would have had a material effect on the pandemic being significantly worse.</p> 
   <p>At the point we did it with the Alpha variant [January 2021], the numbers were incredibly high already, and three or four doubling times from that was an extraordinarily dangerous place for us to get to.</p> 
   <p>So waiting for another couple of doubling times to see what happened would have been, in my view, potentially catastrophic. And that really was the foundations of the decisions that were made at this point in time.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Today's hearing is about the impact of the pandemic on children and young people</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The inquiry’s hearings have been broken into different modules with a focus on different aspects of the UK’s response to the Covid pandemic. The <a href="https://covid19.public-inquiry.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/24141217/Provisional-Outline-of-Scope-Module-8-.docx.pdf">provisional outline of scope for today’s hearing</a> covers:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>The extent to which children and young people were considered as part of any preparedness and planning for a pandemic</p></li> 
   <li><p>The extent to which children and young people were considered by the UK government and the devolved administrations in respect of the application of non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) and the impact of those decisions</p></li> 
   <li><p>The impact of the pandemic on the education of, and the early years provision for, children and young people (including further and/or higher education, apprenticeships)</p></li> 
   <li><p>The impact of the pandemic on children and young people’s physical and mental health, wellbeing, development, family lives and on their access to healthcare services</p></li>

   <li><p>The impact of the pandemic on children and young people in relation to their access to and use of the internet, social media and online resources</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>There are also documents outlining the scope of the inquiry in a simpler form to aid the understanding of <a href="https://covid19.public-inquiry.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/24141134/FINAL-under-12s-Module-8-children-YP.pdf">children under 12</a>, and <a href="https://covid19.public-inquiry.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/12103753/Module-8-Provisional-Outline-of-Scope-over-12s-Children-Young-People-1.pdf">children over 12</a>.</p> 
  <p>The version for younger children explains it all this way, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The UK Covid-19 inquiry is a big investigation to understand what happened during the pandemic and what we could have done better.</p> 
   <p>We are looking at how the pandemic affected children and young people from different backgrounds from across the UK. This includes children who need extra help at school, in life, or are new to our country. We also want to hear from teachers, parents and carers on what life was for children during the pandemic and what they wish could have been different.</p> 
   <p>We want to learn how the pandemic affected children and young people and what can be done to help them if it ever happens again. We also want to help the people who make decisions understand the needs of children and young people in case there is another pandemic. We want to make sure that we understand how the pandemic is still affecting children and young people now, so we can learn from this.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welcome and opening summary …</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/covid-inquiry">the UK’s Covid inquiry</a></strong>, with <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a></strong> set to appear to give evidence this morning.</p> 
  <p>At the present time the inquiry is gathering information about the impact of the pandemic on children and young people, which will be the focus of the questions that the former prime minister is asked today.</p> 
  <p>It is worth noting at the outset that health is a devolved matter, and so during the pandemic England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all had different responses. The Covid inquiry is UK-wide. Scotland has been holding <a href="https://www.covid19inquiry.scot/">its own Covid inquiry</a> into its devolved response, and the <a href="https://research.senedd.wales/research-articles/covid-preparedness-in-wales/">Senedd has this year debated</a> its own report into how prepared Wales was for the pandemic.</p>
