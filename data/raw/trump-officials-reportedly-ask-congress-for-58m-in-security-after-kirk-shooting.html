<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is asking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress">Congress</a> to approve an additional $58m for security services to protect the members of the executive and judicial branches after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">killing</a> of Charlie Kirk, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/trump-admin-live-updates/?id=125354324&amp;entryId=125560934">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-seeks-58-million-security-boost-charlie-kirk-rcna231150">outlets</a> report. They also supported adding more money to protect members of Congress, but they deferred to the legislative branch on further steps.</p> <p>News of the request comes as House Democrats prepare to hold a <a href="https://x.com/scottwongDC/status/1967272823984169034">virtual security briefing</a> on Sunday evening, following Kirk’s death. The briefing will be with the House sergeant at arms and the Capitol police chief.</p> <p>Last week, rightwing activist and Trump ally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/who-is-charlie-kirk-profile">Charlie Kirk</a> was killed while speaking at an event at a university in Utah and a suspect was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-shooting-new-video-of-suspect-released-by-fbi-asamid-urgent-appeal-for-help-from-the-public">arrested</a>. Despite the shooter’s motive still being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-killing-alleged-shooter-motivation">unconfirmed</a>, conservatives have expressed anger and concern, blaming liberals and leftwing activists for Kirk’s killing. The right has declared war on the left, leading prominent politicians to cancel events over safety concerns and threats.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/14/charlie-kirk-death-us-violence">Charlie Kirk’s death raises fears of ‘beginning of a darker chapter’ for US violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/14/charlie-kirk-death-us-violence">reported</a> on Sunday, instances of political violence have been rapidly increasing in recent years.</p> <p>More than 520 plots and acts of terrorism and targeted violence occurred in nearly all US states during the first six months of 2025. At least 96 people have died and 329 injured from that violence. That number is also a nearly 40% increase over the first six months of 2024, according the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/growing-civil-unrest-michael-jensen-8ekuf/?trackingId=%2BmlIf5mAvALJdOHNrbIsEg%3D%3D">Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism</a> at the University of Maryland.</p> <p>Last week, House speaker Mike Johnson said congressional leaders were reviewing security for members of Congress.</p> <p>“We have to protect people who run for public office, or no one will and that is heavy on our hearts and minds,” Johnson said.</p> <p>The Trump administration’s request for an additional $58m in security comes as the deadline for government funding is approaching at the end of the month.
