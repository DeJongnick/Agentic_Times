He vowed to continue with his bid as he met with more Republican senators in Congress and said in a high-profile interview that Trump told him that he had his back.</p> <p>Speaking to Megyn Kelly on Sirius XM, Hegseth dismissed the sexual misconduct and drinking allegations as fiction, comparing them with the similar negative headlines that dogged Brett Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearings for the US supreme court.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/04/pete-hegseth-trump-keep-fighting">Pete Hegseth says Trump told him to ‘keep fighting’ amid rumors he’ll be replaced by DeSantis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It is the classic art of the smear,” Hegseth said. “Take whatever tiny kernels of truth – and there are tiny, tiny ones in there – and blow them up into a masquerade of a narrative about somebody that I am definitely not.”</p> <p>He later told Kelly that if he ultimately became defense secretary, he would stop drinking altogether, likening it to when he followed the military directive prohibiting alcohol consumption on deployment.</p> <p>Hegseth’s team once planned to do Bret Baier’s show on Fox News but ultimately decided on an appearance on Kelly’s show, betting that speaking with a female journalist who had herself spoken out against sexual harassment in a long-form interview would be more beneficial, a person familiar with the matter said.</p> <p>The Hegseth team also thought doubling down on Fox News was overkill, the person said, after his mother earlier appeared on the Fox and Friends morning show to quell concerns about a 2018 email she sent her son that accused him of a pattern of abuse towards women.</p> <p>Penelope Hegseth said she regretted sending the email, in which she said her son “belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around”, and urged senators to consider his nomination. “He’s redeemed, forgiven, changed,” she said.</p>
