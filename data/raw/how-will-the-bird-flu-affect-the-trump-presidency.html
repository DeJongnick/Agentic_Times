<p>Three days after Donald Trump withdrew the United States <a href="https://time.com/7208937/us-world-health-organization-trump-withdrawal/">from the World Health Organization</a>, a Long Island farm <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/long-island-farm-forced-euthanize-100000-ducks-after/story?id=118015774">began euthanizing 100,000 ducks</a> due to an outbreak of bird flu. It marked the latest spread of a virus that has also <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362527/bird-flu-100-million-chickens-dead-risk-humans">killed more than 100 million</a> chickens and turkeys nationwide. Though fewer than 70 Americans <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/us-reports-first-fatal-h5n1-infection-avian-flu-strikes-more-poultry-cats#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20has%20reported,genotype%20circulating%20in%20dairy%20herds.">have contracted the illness</a> so far, scientists have warned that this strain may be just <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bird-flu-virus-is-one-mutation-away-from-adapting-to-human-cells/#:~:text=Scientists%20have%20discovered%20that%20H5N1,found%20in%20the%20upper%20airway.">“one mutation away”</a> from achieving the capacity for rapid transmission.</p> <p>Whether or not those predictions go the way of Chicken Little’s, bird flu has already proved a disaster for humans and animals alike. From <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-cats-dead-sickened-bird-flu-raw-pet-food/">infected pets</a> to <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/why-are-eggs-so-expensive">egg prices soaring</a> by 37%, Americans have abundant cause for concern and complaint. Amid the pathogenic unpredictability, another fact remains clear: the main culprit here is factory farming.</p> <p>By cramming animals into facilities so crowded they often <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/article/battery-cages">can’t even sit down</a>, industrial agriculture has assembled the perfect laboratory for novel viruses. That’s why stopping bird flu in its tracks, and preventing untold future pandemics, depends on regulating factory farming now.</p> <p>Over the past couple of decades, corporate agriculture has finally begun facing scrutiny for its cruel and unusual treatment of animals. At the Obama era’s idealistic outset, documentaries such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/11/food-inc-film-review">Food, Inc</a>, and books like Jonathan Safran Foer’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/28/eating-animals-jonathan-safran-foer">Eating Animals</a> did much to expose the outrages being committed by the now-infamous conglomerates <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/monsanto-crop-system-damage-us-farms-documents">Monsanto</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/05/tyson-foods-factory-farming-antibiotic-resistance-donnie-smith">Tyson Foods</a>. Chickens <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/blog/new-hope-broiler-chickens-who-are-bred-grow-so-fast-they-can-barely-walk">bred to grow so fast</a> they can’t walk, pigs <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">locked in crates</a> too small to turn around in, dairy cows that <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/article/factory-farmed-cows">never step outdoors</a> or graze – these are the daily living conditions for <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/u-s-factory-farm-animal-population-soars-by-50-percent-in-20-year-span/">the 1.7 billion animals</a> currently trapped on US factory farms.</p> <p>The journalist Eric Schlosser, one of Food, Inc’s primary interviewees, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/trumps-invasion-was-a-corporate-recruitment-drive/596230/">has also reported</a> on this industry’s human toll. Thanks to <a href="https://www.wttw.com/chicago-stories/union-stockyards/the-union-stockyards-a-story-of-american-capitalism">Reagan-era deregulation</a>, meatpacking plants eliminated unionized positions and replaced them with undocumented immigrants toiling for half the pay, despite their job carrying the risk of toxic fume exposure, antibiotic-resistant <em>E</em><em> coli</em>, and loss of limbs. Because these largely uninsured farm workers <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/protecting-farmworkers-coronavirus-securing-food-supply/">face termination and even deportation</a> for seeking medical care, they have little incentive to self-report <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/health/bird-flu-diaries-farmworkers.html">illnesses like bird flu</a>, fostering ideal conditions for a virus to spread undetected.</p> <p>But no amount of scandal seems to stall factory farming, which has <a href="https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2024/02/13/new-usda-data-shows-nearly-50-increase-in-u-s-factory-farmed-animals-in-20-years/">grown by 6%</a> since 2017. The explanation is the typical one for Washington: lobbyists. Big agriculture <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/contrib?cycle=2024&amp;ind=A">donated nearly $200m</a> during the 2024 campaign, mostly to Republicans. Agribusiness also spent <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/cultivating-control">more than half a billion dollars</a> to influence the farm bill that doles out the industry’s lucrative subsidies. In his first term, Trump killed <a href="https://civileats.com/2017/12/18/years-in-the-making-trumps-usda-kills-organic-animal-welfare-rules/">new USDA regulations</a> burnishing animal welfare standards, including for the chickens currently ravaged by bird flu. Though Joe Biden <a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2021/06/17/statement-agriculture-secretary-tom-vilsack-organic-livestock-and-poultry-practices-final-rule">reinstated those rules</a>, he slowballed new restrictions by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-epa-livestock-farm-pollution-water-dbf12f71d40b7a7eab8e99c9caa2620a">insisting on further “evaluation”</a>.</p> <p>Still, a few brave politicians have waged a rather lonely crusade against factory farming, with arguably none more devoted to the cause than now retired <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/12/31/earl-blumenauer-talks-about-a-long-career-and-whats-next/">representative Earl Blumenauer</a>, a Democrat from Oregon. The progressive environmentalist spent 28 years in Congress advocating for animal welfare and family farms. As co-chair of the Animal Protection caucus, he<a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/blog/breaking-news-us-house-approves-key-animal-reforms-including-combating-wildlife-trafficking"> gathered bipartisan support</a> for legislation that cracked down on animal fighting, wild animal trading, and cruel horse training techniques <a href="https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/resources/soring_in_horses_factsheet.pdf">like soring</a>. But his passion project was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/26/earl-blumenauer-agriculture-farm-bill-congress">the Food and Farm Act</a>, which would have reined in funding for factory farms. Naturally, it <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1824/all-actions?overview=closed#tabs">never left committee</a>.</p> <p>There are some signs, albeit with significant caveats, that the Trump administration could stumble into progress on this issue. The presumptive health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr may be the strongest critic of big food to join the cabinet in half a century. He has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhS7tnzdDCw">ambitiously pledged</a> to “reverse 80 years of farm policy”, although much of that decision-making belongs to the secretary of agriculture. Still, he could <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/5041370-trump-administration-agriculture/">use his authority</a> over the FDA to ramp up agricultural inspections, investigate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/06/animal-agriculture-nitrate-water">the pollution of drinking water</a> by manure, and halt <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-urges-fda-to-reverse-course-on-guidelines-that-will-worsen-antimicrobial-resistance">the dangerous overuse of antibiotics</a> on factory farms. But Kennedy’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/06/rfk-jr-raw-milk-recall-00192906">repeated endorsement</a> of raw milk, one of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/bird-flu-virus-has-been-found-in-raw-milk-heres-a-reminder-of-how-pasteurization-improves-safety">bird flu’s primary vectors</a>, doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. For that reason – and <a href="https://theweek.com/2024-presidential-election/1025265/a-running-list-of-rfk-jrs-controversies">some others</a> – whether he will be confirmed remains an open question.</p> <p>The mantle for raising the alarm falls, then, to the adviser Trump heeds most reliably: the headlines. But right now, the outcry from corporate media has sounded muffled at best. During the 2024 presidential debates, moderators didn’t ask a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/read-biden-trump-debate-rush-transcript/index.html">single</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542">question</a> about the previous pandemic or this incipient one. While the New York Times has published a smattering of articles about bird flu, calling out the link between industrial farming and our current public health emergency has been mostly consigned to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/opinion/climate-carbon-capture.html#link-79fd0048"> letters to the editor</a> and a few <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/opinion/bird-flu-factory-farming.html?searchResultPosition=5">stray</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/opinion/biden-turkey-thanksgiving-pardon.html">op-eds</a>. In contrast, non-profit outlets like <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/">Sentient</a> and <a href="https://civileats.com/">Civil Eats</a> have dedicated their entire newsrooms to covering industrial agriculture. If cable news and papers of record follow their lead, the consumer-in-chief’s attention or aggravation just might be piqued.</p> <p>It might also inspire some deja vu. In October of 2020, Trump <a href="https://doggett.house.gov/media/blog-post/timeline-trumps-coronavirus-responses">lamented</a>: “You turn on CNN, that’s all they cover. ‘Covid, Covid, Pandemic, Covid, Covid.’”</p> <p>Should Trump choose to wait and see on factory farming, the chances are increasing by the day that such a chant returns – and once again, his hopes for a soaring legacy will be for the bird.</p> <ul> <li><p>Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor and publisher of the Nation, she is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and has contributed to the Washington Post, New York Times, and Los Angeles Times</p></li> </ul>
