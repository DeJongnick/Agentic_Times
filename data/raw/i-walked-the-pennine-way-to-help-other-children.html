<p>I am nine years old and this Easter, I walked the entire Pennine Way – that’s 268 miles from England to Scotland – in just 15 days (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/20/walking-pennine-way-manchester-ramblers-exclusion-countryside">Walking the Pennine Way put everything into perspective for me, including my right to be here, 20 April</a>). I did it to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital, because I want to help other children who are unwell and need support. I wanted to use my legs and my strength to help children who can’t do the same right now. </p> <p>I thought about them every day – through the rain, wind, aching feet and long climbs. The idea came from my dad, who walked the Pennine Way when he was 18. I wanted to follow in his footsteps and show that children can do big things. I filmed short updates every day for my YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Layros14/shorts">Layros14</a>, and raised more than £2,700 through my <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/layla-r-3">JustGiving page</a>. This year marks the <a href="https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/pennine-way-at-60/">60th anniversary</a> of the way, and I’d love for my journey to inspire other young people to take on their own adventures – and to realise that small steps can lead to big change. Thank you to everyone who supported me, donated and cheered me on. <br><strong>Layla Rosowsky</strong><br><em>Cambridge</em></p> <p>• The Kinder trespass is indeed something to commemorate. Let’s not forget that it wasn’t just Manchester ramblers, people came from Sheffield too. And the Ramblers Association itself was opposed to illegal action, much of the organising was done by members of the Young Communist League. Ask a Boltonian (I’m not one), but they may point out an earlier trespass on Winter Hill. Better known now for its telly transmitters. Yes, the countryside should be for everyone. And public transport. Both of these are vital.<br><strong>Mary Wright</strong><br><em>Manchester</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
