<p>The use of screens technology in schools has grown from simply the use of computers and digital whiteboards. Some use artificial intelligence tools to enhance learning and others encourage children to use tablets.</p> <p>Some are calling for smartphones to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/03/brianna-ghey-kate-winslet-smartphone-schools-campaign">legally banned at schools</a>, or for a return to more paper-based learning, while others point out that screens can help make learning accessible to those who have health issues or are neurodivergent.</p> <p>We would like to hear from parents, teachers and anyone working in education on their experiences of technology in schools. Whether it’s the use of tablets for homework or the gamification of some learning, we want to hear your views. We also want to hear from teachers about any difficulties they are facing working in education at the moment.</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="e92249ff-98f0-4fdd-ac29-8fc1f222e5a4" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <p><em><strong>If you’re having trouble using the form click <a href="https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/tech_and_screens_in_schools_and_teachers_experiences">here</a>.
