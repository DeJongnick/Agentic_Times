<p>British plane parts are set to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of the evolving trade agreement with Donald Trump’s administration, it has been reported.</p> <p>The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has said that engines from Rolls-Royce and similar plane parts would be able to enter the US market without tariffs, as part of a trade deal with the UK announced last week.</p> <p>However, there were no references to the exemption in a five-page document released in the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/08/trump-and-starmer-confirm-breakthrough-us-uk-trade-deal">deal’s announcement</a> on Thursday setting out the terms of the “economic prosperity deal” and final details are still to be hammered out.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/11/uk-interest-rate-voters-inflation-wage-demands">UK interest rate cut may not be enough to improve voters’ dim view of the government | Heather Stewart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK businesses secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told the Sunday Times that the wider aerospace industry would have “a specific guarantee of zero tariffs” in the agreement.</p> <p>Such a deal would provide certainty to a £40bn sector, which supports 450,000 jobs in the UK.</p> <p>The deal would also be important to the US. Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners, and repair and maintenance facilities based in the US also require a regular flow of parts.</p> <p>Lutnick said on Thursday that an unnamed UK company would buy Boeing planes worth $10bn (£7.5bn). On Friday, British Airways owner IAG <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/09/british-airways-owner-international-airlines-group-to-buy-32-boeing-planes">confirmed</a> it was buying the planes.</p> <p>The hoped-for deal on aerospace trade comes after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/08/trump-and-starmer-confirm-breakthrough-us-uk-trade-deal">US-UK deal</a> offered relief to the car and steel industries, amid fears of hefty job losses.</p> <p>Although some of the terms are still unclear, the deal is likely to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-economic-deal-with-united-states-saves-thousands-of-jobs-for-british-car-makers-and-steel-industry">bring car tariffs down</a> from 27.5% to 10% on at least 100,000 vehicles a year and steel tariffs to zero.</p> <p>Peter Mandelson, Britain’s ambassador to the US, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/09/us-uk-trade-deal-saved-jobs-jaguar-land-rover-mandelson">said the agreement on UK car exports to the US had immediately prevented job losses at Jaguar Land Rover</a>’s plant in the West Midlands.</p> <p>Reynolds and the prime minister, Keir Starmer, have both indicated that the UK is also hoping to raise the quota on British-made cars beyond the initial 100,000 agreed as part of the final deal, as it threatens to act as a cap on exports.</p> <p>The hoped-for aerospace agreement comes after the US kicked off an investigation on 1 May into whether imported aircraft, jet engines and parts represent a threat to national security.</p> <p>Its examination into the risks of “the concentration of US imports” on a small number of suppliers and the “the impact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices” was expected to pave the way for higher tariffs.</p> <p>However, the aerospace and aviation industry has been lobbying the White House to retain a 45-year-old treaty that allowed aircraft and parts to largely be traded duty-free across borders.</p> <p>The Department for Business and Trade declined to comment.</p>
