<p>Intensive negotiations were continuing on Saturday between the EU and the US before a crunch meeting in Scotland between Donald Trump and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to avert a costly trade war.</p> <p>Trump spent the night at his family-owned Turnberry golf resort on a private visit, but took time to criticise European leaders over wind turbines and immigration, claiming there won’t be a Europe unless they “get their act together”.</p> <p>“I say two things to Europe. Stop the windmills. You’re ruining your countries. I really mean it, it’s so sad. You fly over and you see these windmills all over the place, ruining your beautiful fields and valleys and killing your birds,” he said. “On immigration, you better get your act together,” he said. “You’re not going to have Europe any more.”</p> <p>On Saturday morning, he abandoned a scheduled meeting with the press, who travelled with him on Air Force One, for a round of golf at his seaside course with music blaring from the buggy he drove.</p> <p>Sky News, stationed next to the course, reported the songs included Billy Joel’s Uptown Girl, Elaine Paige’s Memory and Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge over Troubled Water.</p> <p>Billed as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/26/not-welcome-scotland-donald-trump-visit-protests-golf-courses">four-day family visit to Scotland</a>, Trump is meeting European leaders and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, raising hopes of new and refined trade deals with the EU and the UK.</p> <p>On the prospects of an EU trade deal, the US president has said there were “20 sticking points”. When asked what they were, he said: “Well, I don’t want to tell you what the sticking points are.”</p> <p>He described von der Leyen as a “highly respected woman” and said the meeting on Sunday with the EU chief would be “good”, rating the chances of a deal as “a good 50-50”.</p> <p>It is understood von der Leyen and her aides will fly in on Saturday, with the European trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, arriving on Sunday morning.</p> <p>It is expected the deal will centre on an outline agreement in principle over 15% tariff rates for exports including cars, but with a 50% tariff continuing on steel. There may also be a breakthrough deal on pharmaceuticals, setting a rate of 15% for exports.</p> <p>Although this would breach a longstanding World Trade Organization agreement that medicines are rated at a zero tariff, it would be a far cry from the 200% tariff Trump threatened to impose on pharmaceuticals earlier this month.</p> <p>This would have triggered a highly damaging trade war not just with Ireland, where many US multinationals are based, but Germany, Denmark, Belgium, France and Spain.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/26/american-scotland-donald-trump-visit">As an American in Scotland, I know we need many things – but Donald Trump isn’t one of them | Krystal Evans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Von der Leyen’s spokesperson, Paula Pinho, said: “Intensive negotiations at technical and political [level] have been ongoing between the EU and US.
