<p>Influential rightwingers from around the world are to gather in London from Monday at a major conference to network and build connections with senior US Republicans linked to the Trump administration.</p> <p>The UK opposition leader, the Conservatives’ Kemi Badenoch, and Nigel Farage of the Reform UK party, her hard-right anti-immigration rival, will compete to present themselves as the torchbearer of British conservatism.</p> <p>Conservatives from Britain, continental Europe <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/12/bridget-mckenzie-moira-deeming-and-key-news-corp-figures-to-attend-jordan-petersons-civilisation-conference">and Australia</a> attending the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC) conference will seize on the opportunity to meet and hear counterparts from the US, including those with links to the new Trump administration. The House speaker, the Republican Mike Johnson, had been due to attend in person but will now give a keynote address remotely on Monday.</p> <p>Other Republicans due to speak include the US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Vivek Ramaswamy – who has worked with Elon Musk on moves to radically reshape the US government – and Kevin Roberts, the president of the US Heritage Foundation, the thinktank <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/06/project-2025-federal-worker-blacklist">behind the controversial “Project 2025”</a> blueprint for Trump’s second term.</p>    <p>The conference, which is intended to be a gathering of influential intellectuals shaping global rightwing thinking, has a distinctly anti-environmental and socially conservative theme. It pledges to build on “our growing movement and continue the vital work of relaying the foundations of our civilisation”.</p> <p>ARC was co-founded in 2023 by the Canadian psychologist and self-help author Jordan Peterson and the Tory peer Philippa Stroud. Financial backers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/28/loud-and-uncowed-how-unherd-owner-paul-marshall-became-britains-newest-media-mogul">include Paul Marshall</a>, one of the owners of GB News, and Legatum, the private investment firm.</p> <p>After last year’s first event at the O2 Arena, it has moved to a larger venue this year at the ExCel centre. About 4,000 people from 96 countries are due to attend this year, compared with 1,500 last year.</p> <p>Badenoch returns to the lavish three-day event as leader of her party after last year using an appearance to launch a “culture war” attack on the LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall. But while she will give a welcome address to the conference on Monday morning ahead of a keynote speech by Johnson, there is no escape from the challenge her party faces from the hard-right anti-immigration Reform UK.</p>    <p>Farage, the party’s leader, will be interviewed on stage on Tuesday by Peterson while Reform’s chair, Zia Yusuf, is expected to later take part in a panel for a session called “The choices we face: unilateral economic disarmament or a pro-human way?”</p> <p>Figures on the advisory board of ARC include the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, the Tory MP Danny Kruger, the self-styled “sceptical environmentalist” Bjørn Lomborg and the Tory peer and financier Helena Morrissey.</p> <p>It also includes Maurice Glasman, the Labour peer associated with the socially conservative <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/25/maurice-glasman-blue-labour-book-interview">“Blue Labour” strand of thinking</a>, who recently appeared on a podcast hosted by Steve Bannon, the US Republican strategist and on-and-off Trump ally.</p> <p>Peterson will also interview Peter Thiel, the US Republican donor and Silicon Valley billionaire <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/15/peter-thiel-who-is-he-republican-donor-tech-entrepreneur">known for controversial views</a> such as asserting that democracy is not compatible with freedom and that he has “little hope that voting will make things better”.</p> <p>A list of attenders seen by Guardian Australia showed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/12/bridget-mckenzie-moira-deeming-and-key-news-corp-figures-to-attend-jordan-petersons-civilisation-conference">more than 50 Australians</a>, including figures from rightwing thinktanks and churches, were intending to go to the gathering. Among those travelling are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/08/bridget-mckenzie-flight-upgrades-nationals-senator-ntwnfb">Bridget McKenzie</a>, a senator for the National party, along with key figures from Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.</p> <p>Those involved in ARC are keen to promote the gathering as more about the formulation of big ideas than political policy or campaigning and point to conference’s inclusion of scientists and figures from the arts.</p> <p>While religious faith does not explicitly feature in promotional material for the event, there is a strong religious influence on its direction from Peterson, who draws on the Bible in his work, and Stroud, a committed Christian credited with shaping many of the policies of the Conservative party during the 2000s.</p>
