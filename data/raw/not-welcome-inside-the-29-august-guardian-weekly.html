<p>The political conversation is becoming ever more focused on migration, with Reform UK leader Nigel Farage determined to make small boat crossings and asylum seekers the central domestic policy topic while parliament is in recess. The summer has witnessed a clear rise in nationalistic rhetoric with anti-migrant rallies outside hotels alongside a campaign to raise the flags of St George and the union jack. For our cover story, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/estheraddley">Esther Addley</a> examines the increasingly febrile climate across the country and hears why observers are concerned at the lack of government pushback against far-right orchestrated protests.</p> <p>We return to Gaza for the big story based on a joint investigation by the Guardian, the Israeli-Palestinian publication <a href="https://www.972mag.com/israeli-intelligence-database-83-percent-civilians-militants/">+972 Magazine</a> and the Hebrew-language outlet <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%97%d7%a9%d7%99%d7%a4%d7%94-%d7%9e%d7%a0%d7%aa%d7%95%d7%a0%d7%99-%d7%90%d7%9e%d7%9f-%d7%a2%d7%95%d7%9c%d7%94-%d7%9b%d7%99-83-%d7%9e%d7%94%d7%94%d7%a8%d7%95%d7%92%d7%99%d7%9d-%d7%91%d7%a2%d7%96/">Local Call</a> using information from an IDF database. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/emma-graham-harrison">Emma Graham-Harrison</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yuval-abraham">Yuval Abraham</a> reveal what figures collected by the Israeli military suggest about the conduct of their Gaza campaign.</p> <p>Last week, the high court found in favour of the Guardian after the British actor and film-maker Noel Clarke sued for libel over allegations of sexual misconduct.
