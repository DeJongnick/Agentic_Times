<p>It was a solemn pledge at the heart of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s </a>“America first” appeal.</p> <p>A “Make America great again” (Maga) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-foreign-policy">foreign policy</a> would mean the end of military commitments that had in the past sucked the US into draining and drawn-out wars far from its own shores.</p> <p>Now an intense military buildup targeting the authoritarian regime of Nicolás Maduro of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuela</a> is stretching that commitment to the breaking point, as the White House strikes a bellicose posture that seems to mock Trump’s self-proclaimed “president of peace” image.</p> <p>In recent weeks, US forces have carried out at least eight strikes, killing at least 38 people, against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast that Washington said were being used for drug trafficking. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/us-military-strike-alleged-drug-boat-caribbean">latest strike</a>, announced on Friday by Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, reportedly killed six people on a boat allegedly being used to smuggle drugs on what was said to be “a known narco-trafficking route”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/military-boat-strike-pacific-pete-hegseth">Two further strikes</a> in the Pacific this week killed at least five people as tensions also rose between the US and Colombia over the Trump administration’s tactics against alleged traffickers.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/trump-venezuela-land-strikes">Trump plans land strikes against alleged drug traffickers from Venezuela</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the main focus has been Venezuela amid a buildup that has seen <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/marco-rubio-trump-venezuela-policy-afe1ab2c?st=h2fpa6&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">nuclear-capable B-52 bombers</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/16/special-operations-helicopters-venezuela/">elite special operations forces</a> deployed off the South American country’s shores.</p> <p>Trump this month signaled a further escalation by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-covert-cia-action-venezuela.html">authorising the CIA</a> to conduct operations inside the country, fuelling fears that the US was trying to foment a military coup against Maduro – whom it has designated a “narco-terrorist” and for whose arrest it has offered a $50m bounty – or even prepare a ground invasion.</p> <p>“Action on the ground would be the least preferred option, and it certainly wouldn’t be GI Joe – it would be special ops people,” said Fulton Armstrong, a former CIA analyst and national intelligence officer for Latin America.</p> <p>“With technology, you don’t need to invade any more. The whole idea, I believe, is to get the Venezuelans to take him out.”</p> <p>Some Venezuelan analysts say local support for a coup is thin.</p> <p>The policy has been shaped by a Trump administration power struggle that has seen Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and acting national security adviser, triumph over Richard Grenell, Trump’s envoy to Venezuela, who was sidelined after arguing for a pragmatic approach that would help secure oil deals.</p> <p>Maduro and other senior regime figures are said to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maduro-venezuela-us-oil.html">offered extensive concessions</a> in an effort to end the confrontation with Washington, including offering the US a dominant stake in Venezuela’s oil industry. The Trump administration has even eased some sanctions on Venezuelan oil, granting Chevron a licence to resume operating in the country and increase exports from Venezuela. But longstanding tensions have instead escalated further after Rubio pressed the case for a tough approach.</p> <p>“Trump had, in many conversations, meetings with different people emphasized that he really only cared about [Venezuela’s] oil,” said a US businessman with longstanding ties to Venezuela and close knowledge of the White House’s policy. “But Rubio was able to drum up this ‘narco-terrorist’ rhetoric and get Trump to pivot completely. The U-turn really reflects Rubio’s expanded influence in the administration.”</p> <p>Rubio, a longtime critic of Maduro’s socialist regime, won the support of Stephen Miller, the powerful White House deputy chief of staff, and Susie Wiles, the chief of staff, in persuading Trump.</p> <p>He did so partly by seizing on the administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/designating-cartels-and-other-organizations-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-and-specially-designated-global-terrorists/">designation of Tren de Aragua</a>, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/16/nx-s1-5329777/tren-de-aragua-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-venezuelan-gang">transnational gang of Venezuelan origin</a>, as a “foreign terrorist organisation” that had infiltrated the US and allegedly fuelled the influx of undocumented migrants fleeing Maduro’s regime.</p> <p>A White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/">proclamation</a> last March further identified the gang as being in cahoots with the Cartel de los Soles, a shadowy grouping of Venezuelan military figures which the administration insists is headed by Maduro and is responsible for trafficking drugs to the US. Other <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/">sources</a> have questioned that characterisation of the cartel and Maduro’s connections to it.</p> <p>Experts also question Venezuela’s significance as a drugs supplier. Although the country is a conduit for trafficking, it is not a primary source for most illegal substances entering the US. Fentanyl, which is responsible for most US drug-related deaths, is mainly sourced from Mexico.</p> <p>There are doubts over the legality of the boat strikes – which Rubio has vociferously justified – and the military escalation in the name of combating drugs.</p> <p>The White House insists the actions, believed to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/21/us-strikes-caribbean-cia-role">led by the CIA</a>, are legal under the 2001 USA Patriot Act – passed after the 9/11 al-Qaida attacks – which affords scope for action against designated foreign terrorists, a category that now includes Maduro.</p> <p>William Brownfield, a former ambassador to Venezuela and ex-state department drugs and law enforcement czar, said the policy was unprecedented and vulnerable to legal challenge.</p> <p>“I never had anyone seriously suggest to me during my seven years as drugs and law enforcement chief that this issue could be addressed the way it is now,” he said. “I couldn’t even propose it because no one would even entertain the thought of using the military for a law enforcement mission.”</p> <p>Underlying Rubio’s drive may be a mixture of ideology and political ambition. The son of Cuban immigrants, he has long denounced Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, for the financial and oil support they have provided to Cuba’s communist regime.</p> <p>Observers say Rubio is eyeing the Republican presidential nomination in 2028 – when Trump is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term and where adopting a hard line on Venezuela could help secure the Cuban ethnic vote in a close primary election.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/trump-venezuela-cia-maduro">Trump says he authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela as Maduro decries the move as ‘coups d’etat’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tommy Pigott, a state department spokesman, played down Rubio’s role in shaping the policy, saying in a statement: “The president is the one who drives and determines our foreign policy. It is the job of the cabinet to implement. Secretary Rubio is honored to be a part of the president’s team.”</p> <p>He added: “Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela; he’s a fugitive of American justice who undermines regional security and poisons Americans and we want to see him brought to justice.”</p> <p>But there are also wider foreign policy considerations as the US tries to revive its historical habit of treating Latin America as its back yard.</p> <p>“Rubio’s position is that the United States was not paying sufficient attention to the Latin American region writ large and I actually agree with that,” said Brownfield. “The Trump administration is, in fact, being fairly clear when it says that the Maduro regime is a threat to basic democratic values throughout the western hemisphere.”</p> <p>Angelo Rivero Santos, a Latin American studies professor at Georgetown University and former diplomat in Venezuela’s embassy in Washington, said the Trump administration was reasserting the Monroe doctrine, devised in the 19th century and which saw the US claiming Latin America as its exclusive sphere of influence.</p> <p>“It’s not only Venezuela,” he said. “When you look at their statements on the Panama canal, at the impositions of tariffs on Brazil, the latest spat with the Colombian government, not to mention the military presence in the Caribbean, you see a return of the Monroe doctrine.”</p> <p>One aim, Santos argued, was to install more Trump-friendly governments in the region similar to those of Javier Milei, Argentina’s president; Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador; and Ecuador’s president, Daniel Noboa.</p> <p>Another, said Armstrong, the former CIA analyst, was an “ultra-nationalist” projection of strength.</p> <p>“The message is: ‘We’re tough guys,’” he said. “Maduro, like the Cubans, has given the United States the finger and told us to go fuck ourselves, and we have failed with all of the so-called maximum pressure policy that started in Trump 1.0 and has continued and increased in Trump 2.0.”</p> <p>The result, he warned, could be an unpredictable sequence of events as the US tries to goad Maduro into retaliation, which could be used to engineer his downfall.</p> <p>“They can hit a naval target, say a coastal civilian facility, and that might be the provocation that gets Maduro to hit back and maybe do something dumb,” he said. “Then you go for big targets in Caracas, and get a form of chaos. If that doesn’t do it, you put a couple of guys in, special forces or Navy Seals, to do a snatch. Of course he’s not going to go alive. I don’t see a pretty solution.”</p> <p><em>Aram Roston contributed </em><em>additional reporting</em></p>
