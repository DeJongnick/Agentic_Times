<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-08-06T14:00:06Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Lily Smith &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> The Filter</div>
<p>The world, according to a new <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01447-3/abstract">expert review</a>, is in a “plastics crisis”, driven by a huge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/03/world-in-15tn-plastics-crisis-hitting-health-from-infancy-to-old-age-report-warns">acceleration in plastic production</a> and a rise in single-use plastics.</p> <p>At a domestic level, it’s time to take action. Our kitchens in particular are full of plastic, from washing-up brushes to measuring jugs. And with a constant cycle of news stories about their possible harms – from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/27/black-plastic-bad-six-things-to-know">black kitchen utensils that leak chemicals</a> to <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c00924?ref=PDF">chopping boards that release millions of microplastics</a> – our kitchens can feel like a swamp of toxins. </p> <p>Many utensils can be replaced with wooden, metal, glass or even bamboo alternatives. We’re not suggesting you throw out all your plastic kitchen accessories in one go – it’s much more sustainable to use what you already have until it needs replacing than send a perfectly good plastic colander to landfill in the name of being more environmentally mindful. But when the time comes to replace your washing-up bowl or you eventually run out of clingfilm, here are a few of our favourite plastic-free kitchen swaps for you to consider.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Simple plastic-free kitchen swaps</h2> <p>***</p> <h2>Utensils</h2> <p>Both wood and metal utensils have their pros and cons, and both need to be used and cared for correctly to get the most out of them. Wooden and bamboo utensils won’t damage the bottom of your pans, but they do need to be washed by hand with soapy water if you want them to last, and oiled if they start looking dry. Metal utensils are much less high maintenance and are often dishwasher-safe, but you need to take care when using them to avoid scratching your cookware.</p>    <p><strong>KitchenAid </strong><strong>birchwood </strong><strong>utensil </strong><strong>set</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/kitchenaid-birchwood-4-piece-utensil-set-1000221572" > £32 at Dunelm </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/KitchenAid-Eco-friendly-Birchwood-Slotted-Spatula/dp/B0B16GG7Y3" > £27.88 at Amazon </a>  <p>This four-piece set comes with a spoon, fish slice, slotted spoon and slotted turner. A great choice if you like your kitchen to be pretty as well as functional, these lovely Birchwood utensils would look great hanging on the wall.</p>    <p><strong>Bambu bamboo spatula</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://friendlyturtle.com/products/bamboo-scraping-spatula-bambu" > £3.95 at Friendly Turtle </a>  <p>A utensil that can get into the awkward corners of your pans and bowls is always handy, and this bamboo spatula is shaped to do just that.</p>    <p><strong>KitchenCraft </strong><strong>metal oval fish slice</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://seasoncookshop.co.uk/products/pro-short-oval-handled-fish-slice-london-uk" > £6.99 at Season </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/KitchenCraft-Professional-Stainless-Steel-Slice/dp/B0001IWZGS" > £6.40 at Amazon </a>  <p>This oval fish slice is the ideal shape to slide under food stuck to your baking trays. It’s made from stainless steel, so it’s also dishwasher safe.</p>    <p><strong>ProCook </strong><strong>bamboo tongs</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.procook.co.uk/product/procook-bamboo-tongs-18cm-with-magnet" > £2 at ProCook </a>  <p>Whether you need to flip bacon or retrieve a crumpet lodged in the toaster (please switch it off at the wall first), these bamboo tongs are a handy kitchen tool. They have a built-in magnet so you can stick them to the side of your fridge or a metal kitchen appliance, saving you from endlessly fishing around in a drawer.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Wooden chopping board</h2> <p>There’s a misconception that wooden chopping boards are less hygienic than plastic, but <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288665341_Hygienic_aspects_of_using_wooden_and_plastic_cutting_boards_assessed_in_laboratory_and_small_gastronomy_units">studies have shown</a> this isn’t the case. In fact, plastic chopping boards have been confirmed as a previously overlooked <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37220346/">source of microplastics in our food</a>. So wood is by far the best choice for a chopping board. As with utensils, though, wooden chopping boards do require a bit of extra care. Wash them thoroughly with soapy water after use (but never leave them to soak), and wait for them to dry out completely before storing, to prevent mould or cracking in the wood. </p>    <p><strong>Habitat industrial wood butcher’s block</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4847874" > £25 at Argos </a>  <p>This industrial-style board is made from dark acacia wood, formed in the classic chequerboard style of a butcher’s block. It’s so pretty you’ll want to permanently display it on your countertop.</p>    <p><strong>Season </strong><strong>teak </strong><strong>end </strong><strong>grain </strong><strong>chopping </strong><strong>board</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://seasoncookshop.co.uk/products/season-teak-end-grain-chopping-board" > From £70 at Season </a>  <p>Made from sustainably sourced teak, which has natural moisture-resistant properties, this board has a groove around the edge to catch scraps of food and keep your countertops tidy. <a href="https://seasoncookshop.co.uk/products/season-chopping-board-oil">Season also sells its own oil</a> to keep it in top condition.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <h2>Metal colander</h2> <p>Opt for a more durable stainless steel colander over a flimsy plastic one. This one from Dunelm has small enough holes that it can also double as a sieve. </p>    <p><strong>Dunelm </strong><strong>Essentials </strong><strong>stainless </strong><strong>steel </strong><strong>colander</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/essentials-stainless-steel-colander-1000238136" > £5 at Dunelm </a>  <p>***</p> <h2>Measuring jug</h2> <p>It’s generally advised to avoid consuming <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/ng-interactive/2025/apr/30/microplastics-what-to-know">hot liquids that have been exposed to plastic</a>, as some plastics may shed microplastics or leak chemicals when exposed to heat. So if you’re partial to mixing up stock or measuring hot liquids in a plastic jug, it’s worth investing in an alternative. For a convenient and easy swap, go for a glass measuring jug – as these are readily available and often microwave and dishwasher safe.</p>    <p><strong>Pyrex glass measuring jug</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/pyrex-glass-measuring-jug-1l/p176002" > £6 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pyrex-Glass-Measuring-Jug-1L/dp/B000KGCOB2" > £6 at Amazon </a>  <p>This Pyrex jug has both imperial and metric measurements going up to 1L and 1 and 1/2 pints. It’s microwave, dishwasher, oven and freezer safe, making it useful for food prep and storage as well as measuring.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Measuring spoons</h2> <p>You can buy measuring spoons made of stainless steel, china, copper, wood … the list goes on. And there’s no real benefit to plastic spoons over these more eco-friendly materials (with all of them being dishwasher-safe except for wood), so swapping them out is a no-brainer.</p>    <p><strong>Yvonne Ellen </strong><strong>fine china measuring spoons</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/yvonne-ellen-fine-china-measuring-spoons-set-of-4-assorted/p6420952" > £15.40 at John Lewis </a>  <p>These cute measuring spoons come in jolly pastel colours to brighten up your baking.</p>    <p><strong>Tala stainless steel measuring spoons</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/tala-stainless-steel-measuring-spoons-set-of-5/p110452792" > £8 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tala-Measuring-Spoons-Stainless-Steel/dp/B0081K740A" > £5.95 at Amazon </a>  <p>This Tala set comes with five measuring spoons, ranging from 1/4 teaspoon to a tablespoon, and they’re made from durable stainless steel.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Washing-up bowl</h2> <p>Washing-up bowls tend to be made of plastic, and most alternatives are made from stainless steel. While a little harder to come by than plastic, it’s worth seeking one out for stainless steel’s scratch- and odour-resistant qualities.</p>    <p><strong>Buckingham stainless steel washing-up bowl</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.diy.com/departments/buckingham-multi-purpose-washing-up-bowl/5034234159369_BQ.prd" > £22.99 at B&amp;Q </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.robertdyas.co.uk/buckingham-stainless-steel-multi-45-purpose-47-washing-up-bowl-11-litre-47-39-46-5-cm" > £35.99 at Robert Dyas </a>  <p>This round washing-up bowl has a simple but sturdy design. Its 11-litre capacity means it’s suitable for cleaning larger pots and pans, too.</p>    <p><strong>Elephant Box orange stainless steel washing-up bowl</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://elephantbox.co.uk/products/orange-steel-washing-up-bowl" > £48.50 at Elephant Box </a>  <p>Elephant Box’s stainless steel washing-up bowl is big enough to fit 10in plates, and it’s bright orange so will add some cheer to your kitchen.</p>    <p><strong>ASelected rectangular stainless steel washing-up bowl</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASelected-Washing-Stainless-Rectangular-33x33x13/dp/B0BYJPYN45/" > From £19.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>This rectangular bowl is ideal for washing up, but can also be used for washing vegetables or as a mixing bowl. It comes in three sizes.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Dish brush</h2> <p>If you search for a “washing-up brush”, you’ll be met with a deluge of plastic options, with many big retailers offering minimal to no alternatives. But you can find wooden washing-up brushes that use natural fibres for scrubbing. </p>    <p><strong>Wild &amp; Stone coconut fibre dish brush</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.wildandstone.com/products/coconut-fibre-dish-brush-non-scratch-plastic-free-biodegradable" > £4.95 at Wild &amp; Stone </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wild-Stone-Coconut-Fibre-Beechwood/dp/B08L3W6VB1" > £8.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>This brush from Wild &amp; Stone is made from 100% FSC-certified beechwood and sustainably sourced coconut fibre, meaning it’s mostly biodegradable. Just don’t leave the brush sitting in hot water, as the natural glue around the head may dissolve.</p>    <p><strong>Ecoliving wooden dish brush with replaceable head</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.naturalcollection.com/shop/ecoliving-fsc-100-wooden-dish-brush-with-replaceable-head-by-ecoliving/" > £3.56 at Natural Collection </a>  <p>The bristles of this brush are made from plant fibres, and the head can be removed and replaced as needed. This saves you from having to buy a whole new brush, cutting down on waste.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Scourers</h2> <p>The scouring part of a standard kitchen sponge often includes plastic, which can shed and become a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11336334/">source of microplastics throughout our kitchens</a>. But plant-based materials such as loofah and coconut fibres are naturally coarse and up to the task of scrubbing your pots and pans.</p>    <p><strong>Seep eco sponge scourers</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://theseepcompany.com/products/12-month-plastic-free-sponge-stash-1" > £26 for 12 at Seep </a>  <p>Made from loofah and wood pulp cellulose, these sponges from Seep are safe to use on nonstick pans. A pack should last you a whole year.</p>    <p><strong>Regn coconut kitchen scourers</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.regn.co.uk/products/biodegradable-coconut-kitchen-scourers-pack-of-5" > From £3.50 for five at Regn </a>  <p>These scourers are made from coconut fibres that are tough on grime and mess but gentle on your skin. They’re also biodegradable, so you can throw them away guilt-free when they’ve run their course.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <h2>Washing-up liquid</h2> <p>There are plenty of refillable washing-up liquids out there, which help to cut down on plastic by encouraging you to reuse a single bottle. However, many of them still involve plastic packaging for the refills. Not so for Iron &amp; Velvet’s water-soluble sachets, which are delivered inside cardboard packaging. Mix these with water in a dispenser to create the washing-up liquid. There’s no dispenser provided, as you’re encouraged to use one you already own to further cut down on waste.</p>    <p><strong>Iron &amp; Velvet washing-up liquid refill</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://veo.world/product/washing-up-liquid-refill" > £3.50 for five sachets at Veo </a>  <p><strong>***</strong></p> <h2>Dish drainer</h2> <p>Wooden dish drainers can be tempting for a homespun look, but they also need to dry out completely between washes or they’ll go mouldy. Metal drainers are a more practical choice and much more aesthetically pleasing than their plastic counterparts. </p>    <p><strong>Habitat metal and bamboo dish drainer</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8092010" > £25 at Argos </a>  <p>This compact black metal drainer is the perfect size if you have a dishwasher and just want a little extra drying space between loads.</p>    <p><strong>Next two-tier drainer</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.next.co.uk/style/su755065/am1105" > £28 at Next </a>  <p>No dishwasher? This grey two-tier drainer is ideal if you need a little more space for your washing-up.</p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Storage containers</h2> <p>Having storage pots of various sizes to stash leftovers is a great way to cut down on clingfilm. Most containers on the market involve a little bit of plastic (even if it’s just in the silicone seal between the pot and lid), but here are a few made entirely of stainless steel.</p>    <p><strong>A Slice of Green stainless steel oval lunch box</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.naturalcollection.com/shop/a-slice-of-green-stainless-steel-oval-lunch-box-with-mini-container-by-a-slice-of-green/" > From £18.95 at Natural Collection </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://andkeep.com/products/a-slice-of-green-stainless-steel-extra-large-oval-lunch-box" > £24.95 at &amp;Keep </a>  <p>This stainless-steel lunchbox with closure clips is perfect for storing leftover meals or taking lunch on the go.</p>    <p><strong>ZenithCart stainless steel storage pots</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stainless-Steel-rectangle-Storage-Containers/dp/B0DQ5DR5F5" > £21.66 at Amazon </a>  <p>This trio of pots comes with three sizes, making it easy to store half a lemon or other odds and ends.</p>    <p><strong>Elephant Box leakproof food canister trio</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://plasticfreedom.co.uk/products/elephant-box-leak-proof-canister-trio" > £36 at Plastic Freedom </a>  <p>These useful canisters are leakproof, thanks to their screw-top closure – and they’re pretty cute too.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Beeswax wraps</h2> <p>Another alternative to clingfilm is beeswax wraps. They’re made by coating a piece of material in beeswax to make it pliable and able to hold its shape when wrapped around any leftover food. They’re fairly <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/how-to-make-beeswax-wraps.html">easy to make</a>, if you’re up for it, but if not, there are plenty of ready-made ones available. To maintain them, wash with washing-up liquid in cool water, to avoid melting the wax, and gently scrub to remove any residue. Once clean, lay them flat or hang them from a drainer to dry completely before storing.</p>    <p><strong>Tu-Untangle natural beeswax wraps</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1193014668/natural-beeswax-wraps-fresh-fun-and-eco" > £9.76 for three at Etsy </a>  <p>This set of wraps includes three sizes in various fun patterns. Handy for taking a sandwich into the office.</p>    <p><strong>Honey Bee Good dandelion print beeswax wraps</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://honeybeegood.co.uk/products/new-joy-collection-limited-edition-set-of-3-l-m-s-dandelions" > £14.99 for three at Honey Bee Good </a>  <p>In a pretty dandelion print, these beeswax wraps come in a set of three different sizes. The largest is big enough to cover a dinner plate for easy leftover storage.</p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Other ways to cut back on your kitchen plastic</h2> <p>***</p> <h2>Use what you have</h2> <p>Before buying new products, take a look at how you can use what you already own. Things such as jars and other resealable containers from shop-bought foods can be reused to keep leftovers fresh. If you are going to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/18/are-plastic-containers-safe-to-use-food-experts">reuse plastic packaging from takeaways or microwave meals</a>, check the labelling to ensure it is safe to use them in the freezer, microwave or dishwasher first.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <h2>Cut down on plastic bottles</h2> <p>Reduce your use of plastic bottles by having milk delivered in glass bottles from services such as <a href="https://themodernmilkman.co.uk/products/milk">the Modern Milkman</a>. And if you have a penchant for fizzy drinks, you could invest in a carbonator to make them at home. A reusable water bottle can prevent you from having to constantly buy plastic bottles of water when out and about.</p>    <p><strong>Drinkmate OmniFizz sparkling water and soda maker</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.diy.com/departments/drinkmate-omnifizz-sparkling-water-soda-maker-matt-black/0850003006635_BQ.prd" > £89.99 at B&amp;Q </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01EDNNGKK" > £89.99 at Amazon </a>      <p><strong>Chilly’s insulated drinks bottle, 500ml</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/chillys-vacuum-insulated-leak-proof-drinks-bottle-500ml/all-green/p4247240" > £24 at John Lewis </a>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.chillys.com/products/bottle-matte-all-green" > £24 at Chilly’s </a>  <p>***</p> <h2>Make your own cleaning products</h2>    <p><strong>Clean &amp; Green by Nancy Birtwhistle</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://guardianbookshop.com/clean-green-9781529049749/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=plasticfreekitchen" > £9.89 at the Guardian Bookshop </a>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Green-Hints-Tips-Eco-Friendly/dp/1529049741" > £9.85 at Amazon </a>  <p>Make your own cleaning products and put them in a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=refillable+glass+spray+bottle">reusable spray bottle</a> to cut out the plastic packaging.

So if you want your afternoon cuppa to be completely free of plastic, loose leaf is a safe bet. Get yourself a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Reinmoson-Strainers-Infuser-Stainless-Threaded/dp/B0B5ZTZL6G">metal diffuser</a>, or teapot with one built in, and enjoy.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Refill shops or subscriptions</h2> <p>Have you checked whether you have a local refill shop? Selling everything from food to cleaning products, they can be the answer to cutting down on all manner of plastic packaging. You can also buy the exact amount you need, helping to reduce waste. If you don’t have access to a local shop, there are plenty of refill subscriptions online for everything from <a href="https://smol.com/uk/products/laundry-capsules">laundry capsules</a> to <a href="https://www.oddbox.co.uk/">fruit and veg boxes</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>Check out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/27/from-beer-to-books-16-subscription-services-to-save-you-time-and-money">16 subscription services to save you time and money</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Take your lunch to work</h2>    <p><strong>Thermos stainless steel food flask</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/thermos-king-food-flask-stainless-steel-470ml/red-silver/p3777605" > £23 at John Lewis </a>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thermos-Flask-Stainless-Steel-470ml/dp/B077GZQZT8" > £17.60 at Amazon </a>  <p>Instead of picking up a plastic-wrapped supermarket meal deal or chain coffee-shop salad, take your own lunch into work in a flask or lunchbox. This can also save you money in the long run, particularly if you batch cook your lunches at the start of the week. A Thermos flask is a versatile container, ideal for keeping soup or curries hot and pasta salads cold. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/17/18-everyday-products-that-save-you-money-and-make-life-easier">Filter editor Hannah Booth is such a fan that she bought two</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>Check out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/mar/14/simple-ways-cut-down-plastic">20 simple ways to cut down on plastic (and save money)</a></strong></em></p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <h2>Library of things</h2> <p>It’s so easy to fall prey to the latest kitchen gadget, only to use it twice before it gathers dust on your countertop. Reduce waste by borrowing the kinds of appliances you’d use occasionally from a local library of things. They’re available all over the country and allow you to rent all manner of tools for as little as £1.50 a day. When browsing a few local libraries, I spotted everything from waffle makers to air fryers.</p> <p><em><strong>Have you made thoughtful, eco-friendly swaps in your kitchen?
