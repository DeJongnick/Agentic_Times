<p>If the opening night was anything to go by, it looked as if Burnley’s return to the Premier League at the first time of asking was inevitable. It was Scott Parker’s first game in charge, a tricky trip to Luton, who had dropped down with the Clarets. One team had enjoyed a summer of continuity whereas everything had changed at Turf Moor but it was Burnley who&nbsp;left with a dominant 4-1 victory.</p> <p>That warm night at Kenilworth Road was not indicative of what was to come. By the end of the month, three of the goalscorers had left – 11 first-team players departed in August – forcing Parker to almost reset after the campaign had started, but it helped mould his squad into his vision for a promotion push. It would not be done with the flair and style with which Vincent Kompany et al accrued 101 points and 87 goals to win the title two years ago but, with the potential to reach a century, the result could be the same.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/21/back-where-we-belong-leeds-and-burnley-savour-promotion-heroics">‘Back where we belong’: Leeds and Burnley savour promotion heroics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the desperate 2023-24 season in which Burnley secured only five wins as Kompany’s side dropped out of the Premier League, Parker had to rebuild. There had been obvious disappointment that Kompany left so soon but no one at the club begrudged his move to Bayern&nbsp;Munich.</p> <p>The emphasis was put on defence and organisation by Parker as he paired CJ Egan-Riley, who had spent the previous season on loan with PSV Eindhoven’s reserves, and the 22-year-old Frenchman Maxime Estève, who needed to learn quickly about the Championship. It is not a secret that the back five is the reason Burnley are heading back up but the team ethos meant everyone was working for their teammates. They have conceded 15 goals, and never twice in a match, in 44 games thanks to the work of the centre‑back pairing, combined with the right-back Connor Roberts and a combination of Lucas Pires and Bashir Humphreys on the left. Their stoicism has made James Trafford’s reputation rebuild far easier but the goalkeeper has produced inspirational performances, notably saving two penalties late on against Sunderland to secure a goalless draw.</p> <p>Monday’s 2-1 win over Sheffield United made it 31 unbeaten in the league for Burnley, a club record. It was also the 14th time this season they have won by a single goal. While the defence was being constantly praised, the Turf Moor faithful were concerned by the lack of goals. There were six goalless draws in 10 games from mid-December, leading to criticism that Burnley’s conservatism would see them fall short, but as the captain, Josh Brownhill, cheekily put it: “We’ve bored our way to the Premier League.”</p> <p>One key change in the winter window was the acquisition of Marcus Edwards on loan from Sporting. The winger was a key part of Ruben Amorim’s side in Portugal but fell out of favour, alerting English clubs. Before Edwards’ arrival, Burnley were averaging 1.2 goals a game but that has increased to 1.8.</p> <p>Parker has been bolder with his use of Hannibal Mejbri behind the central striker, Zian Flemming, in recent weeks. The former Manchester United midfielder was instrumental in the win over Sheffield United and has the ability to make a difference in the Premier&nbsp;League.</p>    <p>The question is how many of the Burnley squad can make the step up. What worked for Kompany in the second tier did not in the top flight and he was unwilling to change. Parker is far more pragmatic and will be desperate to banish previous Premier League failings. He was relegated with Fulham then sacked by Bournemouth after four games. Another top-division job, with Club Brugge, ended after 10 weeks.</p> <p>The three teams that went up last season are coming back down having invested heavily with little reward; Southampton and Ipswich spent more than £100m on signings, Leicester about £80m. Burnley will enter the market but need to be smarter than this season’s cannon fodder, who have suffered from poor recruitment and changed too much of what had worked. There will not be the folly of Southampton and Ipswich, who have tried to outplay teams; again the plan will be built on defence.</p> <p>One problem Parker may face is that he has turned Trafford and Estève into highly attractive transfer targets. Newcastle have been heavily linked with Trafford and left-sided Estève has piqued the interest of teams across the continent. Burnley will need to do everything in their power to keep their quality and maintain continuity in their strongest area.</p> <p>Flemming has spent much of the season playing as something akin to a No 9 but has rarely looked a natural fit, scoring nine in 32 appearances. Burnley’s 61 goals are six fewer than 14th-placed Norwich and if they are to threaten Premier League teams, a more prolific forward will be required. As the standards increase, the margins will become finer for Burnley; Championship defenders and strikers will be replaced by the world’s best, more goals will be conceded and fewer chances&nbsp;created.</p> <p>What Burnley will take with them is the knowledge that they, unlike Kompany’s team, had to battle for every point. Parker’s efforts may not get him a job at Bayern but, if he can keep his squad together and add some firepower, he could succeed where his predecessor failed.</p>
