<p>As a statement of intent, Ben Shelton’s opening service game on Saturday was quite something. His first serve thundered through at 145mph; on the third point, he upped it to 146mph and on the fifth, he bashed one down at 147mph. If Marton Fucsovics had picked up his rackets there and then and left the court, people would surely have understood.</p> <p>As it was, the Hungarian, ranked 105 having dropped from a high of No 31 in 2019, battled hard to compete but Shelton was a man on a mission, his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory putting him through to the last 16, equalling his previous Wimbledon best.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/05/jannik-sinner-barely-breaks-sweat-to-cruise-through-martinez-mismatch">Jannik Sinner barely breaks sweat to cruise through Martínez mismatch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A hammer of a forehand gave Shelton the first break for 3-1 in the opener and when Fucsovics had the temerity to force a break-back point in the next game, he slammed down a serve at 148mph. That would have equalled the fastest-ever serve at Wimbledon had Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard not raised it to 153mph earlier this week.</p> <p>“I had a lot of fun,” Shelton said. “It’s always special playing at Wimbledon. This is my third time playing on Court No 1. Hopefully I get a few more matches on one of these two big courts. I’m trying to make my way to Centre Court. Maybe I’ll get there one day.”</p> <p>If he keeps playing this well, that’s an inevitability. Though the second set was tight all the way through, Shelton pulled away to take the tie-break 7-4 and an early break in the third set him on his way. As his powerful all-court game flowed, he raced to a 5-1 lead and though Fucsovics got one break back, the left-hander broke again to clinch a convincing victory that sets up a clash with Lorenzo Sonego of Italy.</p> <p>“He’s a great player,” Shelton said of the Italian. “I played him tight in Australia this year, I played him tight in Roland Garros so it’s only fitting we do it in Wimbledon. Grass is a good surface for him, it’ll be difficult, but I like my chances right now, the way I’m playing, the way the crowd is helping with my energy.”</p> <p>Sonego will need to find some energy somewhere after he edged out Brandon Nakashima 6-7 (5), 7-6 (8), 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-6 (3) in five hours and four minutes, the longest match of the tournament this year. The Italian won 45 of his 76 points at the net as he matched his previous best performance here.</p>    <p>This time last year, Alex de Minaur was due to face Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals only to withdraw before the match because of a hip injury that disrupted the rest of his year. On Saturday, the Australian ensured he will get another crack at the seven-time champion as he ended the run of the unheralded Dane August Holmgren 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-3.</p> <p>“It’s funny how life works,” De Minaur said. “Here we are a year later, and I’m going to get that match-up. It is a round earlier. It was a brutal time for me last year having to deal with all of those emotions. But here we are a year later feeling good, ready to go, and I’m going to get my chance again. So I’m excited for that.”</p> <p>Bulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov captured his 100th grand slam singles win, beating Sebastian Ofner of Austria 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (0) to reach the fourth round for the third year in a row, a performance that earned him <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/05/jannik-sinner-barely-breaks-sweat-to-cruise-through-martinez-mismatch">a shot at Jannik Sinner</a>, the top seed.</p> <p>Another Italian, Flavio Cobolli, reached the last 16 of a slam for the first time thanks to a 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 win over the Czech Jakub Mensik and the veteran Croat Marin Cilic followed up his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/03/jack-draper-knocked-out-of-wimbledon-by-inspired-comeback-kid-marin-cilic">surprise win over Britain’s Jack Draper</a> by beating Jaume Munar of Spain 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 to reach the fourth round of a slam for the first time since 2022.</p>
