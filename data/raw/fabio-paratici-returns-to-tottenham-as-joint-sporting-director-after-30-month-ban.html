<p>“I have been working with Johan, Vinai and Thomas as a ­consultant for a number of months and I now look ­forward to returning to ­London and joining the team full-time,” Paratici told <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2025/october/tottenham-hotspur-unveils-new-men-s-football-leadership-structure/">the club’s website</a>. “I’m convinced that working in partner­ship with Johan we can build a special future for the club and our supporters.” </p> 
<p>Spurs said Paratici, who first joined the club in 2021, and Lange had been tasked with overseeing a structure that will “build a winning, world-class men’s team that endures”.</p> 
<p>Venkatesham talked up the appointments, saying: “By uniting two exceptional leaders in Johan and Fabio we’re setting the foundations for sustained success.” The club said they would next recruit a director of football operations. </p>
