Tensions have been rising on Nato’s eastern border since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/14/russian-drone-incursion-poland-nato-ukraine-europe">Russian drones overflew Polish territory</a> last week. Estonia’s foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, said: “Russia has already violated Estonia’s airspace four times this year, which in itself is unacceptable. But today’s incursion … is <strong>unprecedentedly brazen</strong>.” He added: “<strong>Russia’s increasingly extensive testing of boundaries and growing aggressiveness</strong> must be met with a swift increase in political and economic pressure.”</p></li> <li><p>Estonia’s defence forces said the MiG-31s were intercepted on Friday morning by Italian F-35 fighter jets based in Ämari in Estonia as part of the transatlantic defence alliance’s air policing mission over the Baltic Sea. The Russian fighters entered Estonian airspace near Vaindloo island in the Gulf of Finland, did not have flight plans, had turned their transponders off and were not communicating with air traffic control, the Estonian military said.</p></li> <li><p>Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Russia’s actions as “outrageous”</strong> as he urged allies to take “strong action” against Moscow. “<strong>These are not accidents</strong>,” he <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1969101009092813122">warned in a social media post</a>, referring to a long list of Russian violations of European airspace of Poland, Romania and Estonia, and alleged interference in electoral processes in Romania and Moldova. “<strong>It requires a systemic response</strong>,” he said. “Strong action must be taken – both collectively and individually by each nation.”</p></li> <li><p>The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister, accused Moscow of <strong>an “extremely dangerous provocation”</strong> and said the latest Russian violation of Nato’s eastern borders <strong>“further escalates tensions in the region”</strong>.</p></li> <li><p>The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> “stands with Estonia” and would “respond to every provocation with determination”. “As threats escalate, so will our pressure,” she said, <strong>calling on the EU’s 27 member states to swiftly approve the bloc’s 19th package of sanctions against Moscow</strong>.</p></li> <li><p>Nato spokesperson Allison Hart said that <strong>the North Atlantic Council will convene early next week</strong> to discuss the incident in more detail, after Estonia requested Nato open consultations under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/19/eu-sanctions-russia-oil-ukraine-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy-donald-trump-france-macron-europe-live-news?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68cdae208f08e4203c9a824c#block-68cdae208f08e4203c9a824c">Article 4</a> of the alliance’s treaty.

controversy</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>in Palermo</em></p> <p>In other news, Italian far-right deputy prime minister, <strong>Matteo Salvini</strong>, has <strong>sparked a political storm</strong> in the last 48 hours after <strong>first embracing and greeting Russia’s ambassador to Italy</strong>, then <strong>declaring in a television interview that he supports Israel’s right to defend itself.</strong></p>    <p>Despite Italy being a staunch supporter of Ukraine, Matteo Salvini on Tuesday warmly <strong>greeted Russia’s ambassador to Italy, Alexei Paramonov, during a reception at the Chinese embassy in Rome</strong> – a gesture that drew sharp criticism from opposition parties.</p> <p><strong>Davide Faraone</strong>, vice-president of Italia Viva, said:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“It’s a problem for Italy when Salvini embraces the Russian ambassador while our military is engaged in repelling Russian drones in Poland.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Salvini, <strong>who in the past was seen wearing a T-shirt featuring Vladimir Putin’s face,</strong> defended the encounter: “I met the Russian ambassador, as I have met dozens of other ambassadors,” he said.</p> <p>Less than 24 hours later, <strong>he drew more attention</strong> after he insisted in an interview with Israel’s i24News channel on Thursday that Israel “has the right to ensure a peaceful future for itself”.</p> <p>He added: “I speak as Matteo Salvini, as leader of my party and a member of the government. <strong>I cannot speak for everyone</strong>, but from my point of view, defending Israel – Israel’s right to life – means defending freedom and democracy. Therefore, Israel has every right to ensure a peaceful future.”</p> <p><strong>Salvini’s remarks come as Rome considers possible sanctions against Tel Aviv following Israel’s new offensive in Gaza</strong>, raising the risk of embarrassment for the Italian government.</p> <p>In July, Salvini received the Italy–Israel Award, with <strong>Israel’s ambassador in Rome, Jonathan Peled, praising him for having “the courage to publicly take courageous and often disruptive positions”.</strong></p> <p>“If anyone deserves recognition for his efforts to strengthen the strategic bond between Italy and Israel, it is Matteo Salvini,” Peled said at the time.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-19T13:53:52.716Z">at 2.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68cd4ef08f0816a4522be0da" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/jakub-krupa"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-19T12:43:21.319Z">1.43pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Proposed sanctions will still need to be approved by member states — snap analysis</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>On the ‘next steps’ here, it’s worth remembering that <strong>the sanctions proposed by the commission today will still need to be discuss and approved by the member states.</strong></p> <p><strong>Usually, this requires unanimity among all member states</strong>, throwing a spotlight on Hungary and Slovakia’s reactions in particular, as they have a history of blocking or delaying proposed measures.</p> <p>However, <strong>the legal basis of some individual elements of the package, such as reparation loans, is yet to be fully clarified.</strong> Most likely they will also need unanimity, but this will surely be confirmed in due course.</p> <p>But the key point here is that <strong>this is the starting point, </strong>not the final product.</p> <p>There will be a technical process of agreeing and implementing these proposals, and their final shape may still evolve.

In a war driven by innovation, cutting off Russia’s access to key technologies is crucial.
