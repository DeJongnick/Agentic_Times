<p>More than a quarter of a million jobs have been lost in Britain since Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget, official figures show, fuelling a rise in unemployment to the highest level in almost four years.</p> <p>In a blow for the chancellor on the eve of Wednesday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/spending-review-2025">highly awaited spending review</a>, the figures from HMRC show the number of workers on company payrolls fell by 109,000 in May – the largest monthly fall since the same period in 2020 during the first Covid lockdown.</p> <p>Business leaders blamed the hit to jobs on Reeves’s tax-raising October budget, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/30/a-bitter-blow-british-pubs-restaurants-and-hospitality-firms-brace-for-rise-in-nics">a £25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs)</a> affecting more than 1m companies, which came into effect in April.</p> <p>Combined with challenges for employers, including high borrowing costs and heightened uncertainty amid Donald Trump’s trade wars, the figures took the total number of jobs lost since the October budget to 276,000.</p> <p>“These shocking figures should make it abundantly clear to the government that the changes to employer NICs are inflicting more harm than good, and they should be reviewed and reversed urgently,” said Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the lobby group UKHospitality.</p> <p>“We were clear at the time that the changes to NICs were a tax on jobs, and so it is sadly proving.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/jun/10/us-china-trade-talks-resume-uk-jobs-market-weakening-payrolls-tumble-growth-economy-business-live-news">US-China trade talks to resume; UK jobs market ‘weakening’ as payrolls tumble – business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics showed Britain’s official unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in the three months to April, up from 4.5% in the previous three-month period, to reach the highest level since July 2021.</p> <p>Annual growth in regular wages slowed to 5.2% from a revised 5.5%, below City economists’ forecasts for a reading of 5.3%.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/K0eRz/1/" data-alt="UK unemployment chart"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/K0eRz/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The ONS’s figures are based on its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/23/ons-to-spend-millions-on-temp-workers-to-fix-unusable-uk-employment-data">widely criticised</a> labour force survey, which has suffered from collapsing response rates. Experts have argued this leaves policymakers “flying blind”, creating the prospect that decisions are being taken based on flawed data.</p> <p>However, economists said there was clear evidence of a slowdown in the labour market, including a 63,000 fall in the number of job vacancies posted by employers in the three months to the end of May.</p> <p>Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: “These figures suggest that the UK’s jobs market took a damaging hit from ‘Awful April’, with the tough reality of sharply rising NICs and national living wage costs pushing more employers to cut staff.</p> <p>“The UK’s labour market is in a painful period with eye-wateringly high business costs likely to mean more job losses this year, particularly if the spending review increases the odds of more tax hikes in the autumn budget.”</p> <p>Businesses in typically lower-paying sectors, including hospitality, leisure and retail, had warned jobs could be hit. Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said the increase in unemployment was “disappointing but no surprise”.</p> <p>It comes as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/20/bank-of-england-holds-interest-rates-inflation-uk-economy">Bank of England</a> monitors the jobs market for signs of weaker conditions as policymakers consider whether to cut interest rates further after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/08/uk-interest-rates-cut-bank-of-england-uk-economy-trump-tariffs">four earlier reductions in borrowing costs to 4.25%</a>.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street is widely expected to keep rates on hold next week amid heightened uncertainty over the impact of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/09/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-trade-war-no-one-will-win-but-china-is-taking-the-long-view">Donald Trump’s increasingly erratic trade wars</a> on the world economy.</p> <p>Economists said the sharper-than-expected slowdown in wage growth could encourage the Bank to cut borrowing costs by a further quarter of a percentage point at the following meeting in August. The pound fell by about 0.5% against the US dollar after the data.</p> <p>James Smith, a developed markets economist at ING, said: “The UK jobs market might be turning a corner – and not in a good way.</p> <p>“If nothing else, this should help cement another rate cut in August and further quarterly cuts in November and into 2026. We wouldn’t totally rule out the Bank moving faster, particularly because we are more upbeat about the inflation outlook.”</p> <p>Despite the rise in unemployment, separate figures showed the rate of economic inactivity – when working-age adults are neither in a job or looking for one – fell by 0.2 percentage points to 21.3%.</p> <p>Alison McGovern, the employment minister, said the government was putting in place more help for jobseekers. </p> <p>“Supporting more people into work and putting more money in the pockets of working people is at the heart of our plan for change,” she said.</p>
