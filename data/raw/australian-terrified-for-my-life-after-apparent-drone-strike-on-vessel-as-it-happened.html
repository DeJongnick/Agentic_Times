Coalition in NSW</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The koala wars are alive and well in NSW, it seems, and again look set to cause serious marital strife for the Nationals and Liberals.</p> <p>The Minns Labor government set the ball rolling on Tuesday afternoon by moving a public interest debate, patting itself on the back for finally declaring the 176,000 hectare <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/08/minns-140m-great-koala-national-park-regional-towns-coalition-nsw">Great Koala national park</a>, an election promise made in 2019 and again in 2023.</p> <p>The Nats then tried to amend the motion calling on the government to shrink the park to 37,000 hectares and protect timber worker jobs.</p> <p>In an unusual move, the Liberals just did not show for the vote on the Nationals’ amendment, which failed 11-51, or for the motion itself.</p> <p>The Liberals’ no-show has left the Nationals furious. The Nationals firebrand Wes Fang posted on X:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The gutless NSW Liberal party members didn’t turn up to the Lower house to vote in support [of] the NSW Nationals on #Forestry&amp;#Timber jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>More fallout is expected.</p> <p>In 2020, the Nationals, then led by the feisty <strong>John Barilaro</strong>, briefly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/11/nsw-nationals-ditch-threat-to-quit-coalition-as-john-barilaros-leadership-condemned-as-untenable">left the Coalition after a dispute over clearing of koala habitat on private land</a>, which the environmentally-conscious former planning minister <strong>Rob Stokes</strong> had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/11/the-nsw-deputy-premier-threatened-to-blow-up-the-coalition-was-it-really-all-about-koalas">sought to protect using the planning laws</a>.</p> <p>The split only lasted a few days, but was politically costly. Both Barilaro and Stokes have now left politics.</p> <p>With the opposition leader, <strong>Mark Speakman,</strong> under pressure over his “cut-through”, the politics of koalas may be his undoing as well.</p> <p>Or it could be the hunting bill, or support for net zero.

He spoke to AAP from Tunis hours after the explosion:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I felt the heat of a massive ball of flames. I was sleeping on the top deck as it hit … I was shocked and terrified for my life.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <strong>Global Sumud Flotilla</strong> said the main and storage decks were damaged by fire from the strike, which Tunisian authorities deny took place.</p> <p>The flotilla is part of an international effort to deliver air to Gaza through civilian boats with several high-profile celebrities joining the initiative including the environmental activist <strong>Greta Thunberg</strong>.</p> <p>Omar documented the charred aftermath of the strike showing burnt lifejackets and sooty walls, broadcasting it to his tens of thousands of social media followers. Australia’s department of foreign affairs was contacted for comment.</p> <p>An investigation into the drone attack was under way, the flotilla said.</p> <p>Tunisia’s<strong> National Guard</strong> spokesperson has said reports of a drone attack on the flotilla “have no basis in truth” and claimed an initial inspection indicated the explosion initiated inside the vessel.

It also proposed to force payment service providers, including the major banks, to cut the fees they charge businesses to take card payments.</p> <p>The RBA estimated the lower cap on those “interchange” fees would benefit nine in 10 businesses but push combined costs of $25m on to payment service providers.</p> <p>The Australian Banking Association has today said it supported the surcharge ban but warned a cap on interchange fees would hurt customers and businesses. <strong>Simon Birmingham</strong>, the ABA’s chief executive and a former Coalition government minister, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There is a risk that driving [those fees] down further would put further pressure on household budgets through higher card fees, shorter interest-free periods and diminished rewards.</p> </blockquote> <p>The ABA made its submission on behalf of the big four banks – Commonwealth, ANZ, Westpac, NAB – and 15 others. Macquarie Bank was the only ABA member to break from the proposal, instead suggesting interchange fees should be cut to support businesses but surcharges may need to stay for credit cards.</p> <p>Consumers, meanwhile, are struggling to avoid the seemingly ubiquitous surcharges. <strong>Kat George</strong> explains why in this article:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/09/i-dont-want-to-pay-a-card-fee-but-the-business-wont-accept-cash-instead-is-this-legal">I don’t want to pay a card fee but the business won’t accept cash instead.

NSW Health said the figures were a “marked increase” on the numbers normally seen in that period, with only two of the cases believed to be linked.</p> <p>In cases where blood or urine tests were taken, results showed heroin was present with the cocaine. <strong>Dr</strong> <strong>Darren Roberts</strong>, the medical director of the NSW Poisons Information Centre, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>One of the dangers of illicit drug supply is the contents and strength of the substance you are getting is uncertain and can be inconsistent. An opioid overdose could quickly result from a single line.</p> <p>Opioids such as heroin can be sold as or found in cocaine, methamphetamine and MDMA (ecstasy). You cannot always tell the difference between these drugs by appearance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Symptoms of opioid use include pin-point pupils, drowsiness, loss of consciousness, slowed breathing/snoring and skin turning blue/grey. The drugs can be life-threatening.</p> <p>NSW Health also urged those that may be around drugs or at risk of an opioid overdose to carry Naloxone, a life-saving medication that reverse the effects of opioids.

step.</p> <p>“A poorly designed policy that just taxes these emerging technologies would be a disaster for transport emissions,” she will say.</p> <p>“But based on the treasurer’s words to date, he seems fine to tax EV drivers and electric trucks while companies like BHP continue to enjoy half a billion dollars in completely tax free fuel.</p> <p>“The Greens want to see tax settings that get

squibs it on a new climate emissions reduction target for 2035.</p> <p>Labor is preparing to release its 2035 emissions reduction target this month, before the prime minister heads to the UN general assembly in New York.</p> <p>A 2035 target range of about 65% reductions on 2005 levels is expected, lower than environmental groups would be satisfied with.</p> <p>Waters, in a speech to the Smart Energy Conference in Brisbane later today, will argue that targets are “a zero sum game”.</p> <p>She will say:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Someone wins and someone loses.</p> <p>With a low Australian target, international coal and gas corporations win, their profits go up while Australians are the ones who have to pay for it in insurance premium increases, in cleaning up after floods and cyclones and in lost profits for farmers and more expensive food for us.</p> <p>Who would lose the most with high targets? Gas companies like Woodside - who also happen to be on the board of the [Business Council of Australia].</p> </blockquote>    <p>Business Council modelling released last week suggested that a 2035 target of 60% would require at least $400 billion in new capital investment.</p> <p>Waters calls that modelling “highly contested” and says the Greens will be following advice from climate scientists.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>And the science says to maintain global temperatures below 2 degrees we need to be at net zero by 2035, putting us at the forefront of a swiftly decarbonising world.</p> <p>Strong economy, clean renewable energy, reduced emissions.
