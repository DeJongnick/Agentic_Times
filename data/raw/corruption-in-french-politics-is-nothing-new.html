<p>You are right to highlight the horrific abuse being levelled at Nathalie Gavarino, the judge who presided over the trial of Nicolas Sarkozy (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/21/the-guardian-view-on-sarkozys-first-day-in-prison-no-citizen-is-above-the-law">Editorial, 22 October</a>). </p> <p>Corruption in French politics is nothing new: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/jacques-chirac-guilty-corruption">Jacques Chirac was convicted of corruption</a> while mayor of Paris in the 1970s, and Sarkozy’s own prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/01/francois-fillon-fights-save-french-presidential-election-bid-fake-jobs-scandal">François Fillon</a> (in office from 2007 to 2012) saw his presidential election campaign fall apart in 2017 over allegations of employing his family using public money. </p> <p>It is, however, the scale and egregiousness of Sarkozy’s corruption that mark his case out most starkly. Not only did Sarkozy gain the nickname “President Bling-Bling” for his ostentatious lifestyle while occupying the Élysée Palace, but his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/15/muammar-gaddafi-allegedly-gave-nicolas-sarkozy-50m-euros-2007-presidential-campaign">acceptance of funds from Muammar Gaddafi</a> was surely a new low for French politics.</p> <p>As you point out, the politician most likely to be the next president of France, the far-right leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/31/the-guardian-view-on-the-marine-le-pen-verdict-no-politician-is-above-the-law">Marine Le Pen, is herself awaiting the outcome of an appeal</a>, also related to corruption. Although it is indeed heartening to see public approval for Sarkozy’s imprisonment, the news that he will have access to two police bodyguards throughout his time in jail demonstrates that he is no ordinary prisoner.</p> <p>All this comes, of course, at a time when the French national assembly is locked in a political stalemate. Further examples of corruption are likely to undermine yet more the political system ahead of the 2027 presidential election race. French politicians must prove they can rise above this to move France forward.<br><strong>Dr David Lees</strong><br><em>University of Warwick</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
