<h2><strong>What Happened at Hiroshima</strong></h2> <p><strong>8.30pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>Eighty years after the atomic bomb attack, a flame burns in the middle of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Japan. It will only go out when all nuclear weapons are destroyed, but we are moving further and further away from that point. Jordan Dunbar meets survivors and campaigners who share how horrified they are about the state of the nuclear threat today. It is moving and pressing, but limited to just half an hour. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2><strong>Panorama: Why I Joined a Riot</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>It has been a year since the Southport attacks – in which three girls were killed – and the national riots that followed. Darragh MacIntyre, who reported on those events, returns to speak with three people who took part, as well as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/27/victims-far-right-riots-lingering-fear-uncertain-future">Ibrahim Hussein</a>, the imam of Southport mosque. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>Michael Mosley: Secrets of the Superagers</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>In the last series he recorded before his death, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jun/09/dr-michael-mosley-obituary">Michael Mosley</a> – TV’s favourite doctor – meets people keeping healthier for longer. Is gentle tai chi more beneficial than vigorous cardio? And can an 86-year-old really cycle his way to getting the immune system of a twentysomething? The doc finds the right people to ask. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>Human</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>During one of the coldest eras in history, humans entered the Americas – “a world that was magical, pristine and primal”, as Ella Al-Shamahi discovers. Here they faced colossal predators including 12ft prehistoric bears (“the stuff that nightmares are made of”). Yet as the climate changed, they adapted through innovation, eventually planting the seeds of farming – and civilisation. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2><strong>Chloe Ayling: My Unbelievable Kidnapping</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Three</strong></p>    <p>In July 2017, 20-year-old model <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/07/chloe-ayling-anything-think-free-just-got-to-do">Chloe Ayling</a> was lured from the UK to Milan for a photoshoot that became a six-day abduction ordeal. In this expansive new three-parter, Ayling reflects on her traumatic experience and the hostile reactions she subsequently received on social media. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2><strong>The Gilded Age</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Atlantic</strong><strong><br></strong>Julian Fellowes’s Yankee Downton is now on its third season, and is belatedly becoming quite the treat. This week, Larry is back from his business trip in Arizona but his father, George, has some bad news for the Russell scion. And just who is spilling the tea about the family to the press? <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p>
