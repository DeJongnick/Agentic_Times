<h2>Mutiny breaks out on Russian battleship</h2> <p>29 June 1905</p> <p>The news from Odesa yesterday is fresh proof of the utter absence of discipline in what remains of the Russian navy. The crew of the great battleship Kniaz Potemkin have mutinied and attacked the officers. Telegrams from Odesa to Washington, St Petersburg, and other places speak of the whole of the officers of the vessel as murdered. The only doubt arises from the fact that Reuters’ correspondent at Odesa does not confirm this, but mentions an unconfirmed report that several officers have been killed. As, however, the crew are apparently masters both of themselves and of the battleship, and are compelling the crews of steamers in the harbour to cease work, it seems that the majority of the officers must have been killed.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/nov/16/archive-battleship-potemkin">Battleship Potemkin on the screen: archive, 16 November 1929</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The remainder of the Black Sea Fleet is expected at Odesa. The mutineers may either take to the land and endeavour to escape, or may face the other ships of the squadron. They could offer no real resistance to the seven battleships which could be brought against them, but since the crews of the whole fleet mutinied only seven months ago it is open to doubt whether their comrades would fire on them. A solution consistent with the traditions of the Black Sea Fleet would be that the mutineers should return quietly to their duties when they think fit and the authorities punish them at some future date if they think themselves strong enough.<br><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jun/29/archive-mutiny-breaks-out-on-russian-battleship-1905">Continue reading</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jun/29/archive-mutiny-breaks-out-on-russian-battleship-1905">.</a></p>    <h2>Still at large: Potemkin in a Crimean port</h2> <p>6 July 1905</p> <p>The Kniaz Potemkin has reappeared at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Feodosiya">Theodosia</a>, in the Crimea. A proclamation to foreign powers, drawn up by the mutineers, states that a decisive struggle against the Russian government has begun, and also that foreign shipping and ports in the Black Sea will be held inviolate. Two torpedo craft, manned almost entirely by officers, are now reported to be in pursuit of the Potemkin, which will probably be able to obtain coal and provisions at Theodosia. The rebel crews are living from hand-to-mouth, but can apparently terrorise the coast towns, into supplying them with provisions; if the pursuing warships do not discover and defeat them it should soon be seen whether the threat of war against loyal Russian shipping is actually to be carried out.</p> <p>In St Petersburg the assistance of the Cossacks has been called in once more to disperse strikers; volleys have been fired, and several casualties are reported.</p> <p><strong>Potemkin at Theodosia<br></strong>The rebel battleship Kniaz Potemkin has arrived, and has asked for coal and provisions and a doctor. The mutineers have demanded from the town authorities a guarantee of their safety during their stay.</p> <p>According to the latest reports, the Kniaz Potemkin appeared off Akkerman, west of Odesa, on Monday, and sent a torpedo boat into the harbour to demand coal and provisions. The authorities refused to furnish these, whereupon the torpedo boat fired two shots, and subsequently obtained all the supplies it required.</p> <h2>Potemkin surrenders to Romania</h2> <p>10 July 1905</p> <p>The Kniaz Potemkin surrendered on Saturday to the Romanian authorities at <a href="https://www.getamap.net/maps/romania/constanta/_kustenja/#google_vignette">Kustenji</a>. Their leaders, it is stated, wished to blow up the ship, but the other mutineers were ready to accept the Romanian terms. They will be taken to the Romanian frontier and may go where they please. The Potemkin has been handed over to Admiral Kruger, who arrived at Kustenji on Saturday in pursuit of the mutineers. The torpedo boat which has accompanied the Potemkin in its wanderings declined to surrender and left Kustenji. The crew declared that they had only followed the Potemkin under compulsion. Seven officers were found to have been kept prisoners on the battleship.</p> <p>A serious outbreak is reported from some of the naval barracks in St Petersburg. The disorders in the south of Russia have been checked for the present, but from Warsaw and from the town of Makareff, which lies to the north-east of Moscow, come familiar reports of strikes and rioting and pillaging of shops.</p> <h2>A visit to the Potemkin</h2> <p>10 July 1905</p> <p><em>Kustenji<br></em>I have just paid a visit to the Kniaz Potemkin. I found everything on board in a state of wild disorder notwithstanding the efforts made since yesterday by Romanian soldiers to put things shipshape. The officers’ cabins especially have been pillaged and simply cleared of everything worth taking. There are bloodstains everywhere.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/23/russian-revolution-1905-st-petersburg">Soldiers massacre demonstrators in St Petersburg - From the Guardian archive, 23 Jan 1905</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During the last few days the Kniaz Potemkin was commanded by two of her engineers and one officer, who were compelled to navigate the ship with revolvers at their heads. There was sufficient ammunition on board to enable the mutineers to make a desperate resistance, and hold their own in a great engagement. Numerous ikons were everywhere in evidence. While I was on board an order was received from the king of Romania to hand over the ship to Admiral Kruger without raising any difficulty. After an exchange of signals the Admiral came on board to take possession. A Russian priest who was in the ship first held a religious service, and an hour later the Romanian officials formally handed over the battleship to the Russian Admiral.</p>
