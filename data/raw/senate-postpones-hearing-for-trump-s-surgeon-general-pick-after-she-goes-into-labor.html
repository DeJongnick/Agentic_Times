<p>The Senate hearing for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s nominee for surgeon general, Casey Means, has been postponed after the nominee went into labor with her first child.</p> <p>Means had planned to make history as the first nominee to appear virtually before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">Senate</a> health, education, labor and pensions committee due to her pregnancy on Thursday. The hearing was originally scheduled for two days after her due date, a person familiar with the matter told <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/casey-means-surgeon-general-hearing-delayed-labor">CNN</a>. It remains unclear when the hearing will be rescheduled.</p> <p>In a statement shared with the Guardian, Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the department of health and human services (HHS), said: “Everyone is happy for Dr Means and her family. This is one of the few times in life when it’s easy to ask to move a Senate hearing.”</p> <p>Trump nominated Means in May to serve as US surgeon general, the president’s second pick for the role often referred to as “the nation’s doctor”. Means, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/casey-means-surgeon-general-pick">wellness influencer</a> and physician with an inactive medical license, follows the abrupt withdrawal of Trump’s first nominee, Dr Janette Nesheiwat, whose confirmation hearing was canceled amid rightwing criticism and questions about her credentials.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/casey-means-surgeon-general-pick">Casey Means: influencer, RFK Jr favorite – and Trump’s pick for surgeon general</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Means, 38, is a Los Angeles-based medical entrepreneur who rose to prominence in conservative wellness circles for her critiques of mainstream medicine and her advocacy for improving the nation’s food supply.</p> <p>She is the author of the bestselling book Good Energy and a leading figure in the “Make America healthy again” (Maha) movement.
