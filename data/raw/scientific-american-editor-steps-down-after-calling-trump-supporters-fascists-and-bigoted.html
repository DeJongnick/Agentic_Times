<p>The editor in chief of Scientific American, the US’s oldest magazine, has announced her resignation after a series of online posts in which she called some Donald Trump supporters “fascists” and “bigoted”.</p> <p>In a post on Bluesky on Thursday, Laura Helmuth, who was originally appointed as the magazine’s editor in chief in 2020, said: “I’ve decided to leave Scientific American after an exciting 4.5 years as editor in chief. I’m going to take some time to think about what comes next (and go birdwatching).”</p> <p>Helmuth’s resignation comes after a series of expletive-filled posts on 5 November – election night – in which she criticized those who voted for Trump.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/election-campaign-outcome-analysis">Joy, fascism and a staggering gender gulf mark a US election like no other</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her since-deleted posts on Bluesky, Helmuth wrote: “Every four years I remember why I left Indiana (where I grew up) and remember why I respect the people who stayed and are trying to make it less racist and sexist. The moral arc of the universe isn’t going to bend itself.”</p> <p>She went on to add: “Solidarity to everybody whose meanest, dumbest, most bigoted high-school classmates are celebrating early results because fuck them to the moon and back.”</p> <p>“I apologize to younger voters that my Gen X is so full of fucking fascists,” Helmuth continued.</p> <p>Following her posts, Helmuth issued a public apology, writing on Bluesky: “I made a series of offensive and inappropriate posts on my personal Bluesky account on election night, and I am sorry. I respect and value people across the political spectrum.</p> <p>“These posts, which I have deleted, do not reflect my beliefs; they were a mistaken expression of shock and confusion about the election results. These posts of course do not reflect the position of Scientific American or my colleagues. I am committed to civil communication and editorial objectivity,” she added.</p> <p>Despite her apology, Helmuth’s posts gained traction among conservative voters online, with staunch Trump ally and X owner Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856348704514437170">accusing</a> her of being a political activist who has taken over a scientific institution.</p> <p>A week after her apology, Helmuth announced her resignation. In a statement to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/scientific-american-editor-chief-leaves-anti-trump-comments-rcna180400">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/15/nx-s1-5193258/scientific-american-editor-resigns-after-comments-about-trump-supporters-went-viral">outlets</a>, Kimberly Lau, the president of the magazine, said: “We thank Laura for her four years leading Scientific American during which time the magazine won major science communications awards and saw the establishment of a reimagined digital newsroom.”</p> <p>During Helmuth’s time as editor in chief and for the first time in 175 years, Scientific American decided to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientific-american-endorses-joe-biden1/">endorse</a> a presidential candidate – Joe Biden – in 2020. This year, the magazine endorsed Kamala Harris, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vote-for-kamala-harris-to-support-science-health-and-the-environment/">saying</a> that Trump “endangers public health and safety and rejects evidence, preferring instead nonsensical conspiracy fantasies”.</p>
