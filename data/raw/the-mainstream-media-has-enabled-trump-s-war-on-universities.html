<p>US universities are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/04/us/trump-news#trump-harvard-international-student-visas">facing</a> the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5321250-university-of-california-donald-trump-target/">Trump regime’s</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-education-department-says-columbia-university-violated-federal-anti-2025-06-04/">fury</a>. The justification given by the regime is that universities are run by leftist ideologues, who have indoctrinated students to adopt supposedly leftist ideological orientations, as well as hostility to Israel, anti-whiteness and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5333675/university-pennsylvania-upenn-trump-suspends-funding-trans-student-athletes">trans inclusivity</a>. Donald Trump and his allies believe the election gave them the mandate to crush America’s system of higher education. But what may be less clear is that it is the mainstream media’s obsession with leftists on campus that has led to the current moment.</p> <p>The US mainstream media has waged a decade-long propaganda campaign against American universities, culminating in the systematic misrepresentation of last year’s campus anti-war protests. This campaign has been the normalizing force behind the Trump administration’s attack on universities, as well as a primary cause of his multiple electoral successes. Unless the media recognizes the central role it has played, we cannot expect the attack to relent.</p> <p>It is easy to pinpoint the time that US confidence in higher education started to drastically plummet – <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646880/confidence-higher-education-closely-divided.aspx">the year was 2015</a>. For those of us who have followed this attack throughout the last decade, there is no surprise about this date. It was the year that a spate of political attacks against universities started to emerge, resurrecting the 1980s and 90s conservative panic about “political correctness on campus”, except this time in mainstream media outlets.</p> <p>In 2016, the media scholar Moira Weigel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/30/political-correctness-how-the-right-invented-phantom-enemy-donald-trump">in an article in the Guardian</a> entitled “Political correctness: how the right invented a phantom enemy”, laid out in detail how this attack, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/20/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind-review">suddenly legitimized</a> by mainstream media outlets, led to Trump’s 2016 victory. Weigel singles out an enormously influential piece in the Atlantic by Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff, “The coddling of the American mind”. In it, Haidt and Lukianoff decried the supposed trend of shielding students from “words, ideas, and people that might cause them emotional discomfort”. Haidt and Lukianoff’s goal was to suggest that younger generations were “coddled” and protected from emotional harm by college campuses, beginning a trend of infantilizing college students.</p> <p>From 2015 on, much of the mainstream media went on a crusade to vilify universities for political correctness. The Trump regime’s vicious targeting of US universities was justified and normalized by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/opinion/were-all-fascists-now.html">decade</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/12/opinion/cancel-culture-college-campus.html">panicked</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/opinion/student-mobs.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fdavid-brooks&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion%C2%AEion=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection">op-eds</a> about leftists on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/opinion/harvard-claudine-gay-resignation.html">campus</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/30/opinion/campus-free-speech-duncan.html">in</a> the New York Times, which included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/opinion/university-campus-diveristy-inclusion-free-speech.html">laying the basis</a> for the administration’s cynical attack on DEI (to understand the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/opinion/campus-speech-cancel-culture.html">staggering</a> number of concern-trolling op-eds about leftists on campus the New York Times has published over the last decade, consider this <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/david-brooks-times-conservatives.html">article in Slate</a>, by Ben Mathis-Lilly, about this exact topic; it was published in 2018.)</p> <p>There have always been excesses of what was<em> </em>called “political correctness” and now is called “wokeness”. During times of moral panic, excesses are held up as paradigms. One might single out attempts to de-platform speakers as one such excess. To judge by the mainstream media, there have been a wave of such attempts. The organization that counts them, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire), has recorded 1,740 attempts to de-platform speakers at colleges and universities over the last two decades or so. That sounds like a lot. However, <a href="https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/campus-deplatforming-database-methodology">the methodology</a> for counting a “de-platforming attempt” includes petitions calling for the speaker’s invitation to be canceled or withdrawn – so if a dozen people sign a petition to revoke a speaker’s invitation, it counts as an “de-platforming attempt”, even when (as is often the case) nothing comes of it. Even in the case of successful de-platforming attempts, a speaker whose talk is postponed or who is reinvited counts as a case, as is when a venue has to be switched from one on-campus auditorium to another (say, for safety concerns). This methodology blatantly inflates the prevalence of problematic cancellations of speakers (given that de-platforming attempts can count towards evaluating a university’s position on Fire’s influential “Campus Free Speech Rankings”, this methodology also distorts public conversation about the topic). Fire unquestionably does good things. But its very existence depends on fanning the flames of moral panic about universities.</p> <p>More generally, in many <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/09/08/professor-suspended-saying-chinese-word-sounds-english-slur">cases</a> of university actions that can legitimately be regarded as problematic, the fault was not “political correctness” or “wokeness”, but a corporate and legalistic environment at universities that requires the investigation of every complaint, no matter how overblown. We college professors are fairly uniformly opposed to this culture. But it is hardly the fault of leftists.</p> <p>Finally, no one should mistake an <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/evergreen-professor-at-center-of-protests-resigns-college-will-pay-500000/">epidemic</a> of faculty members <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/28/sussex-professor-kathleen-stock-resigns-after-transgender-rights-row">performatively quitting</a> their jobs with an epidemic of firings. When a university fires an academic for their speech, that is a crisis. When a faculty member chooses to resign rather than face student opprobrium, that is just life.</p> <p>It may surprise the reader to learn that during the last decade, the main “chill” at universities has not been “leftists on campus”. It has instead been a relentless attack on college professors and students by rightwing outlets. In 2016, Turning Point USA introduced its “<a href="https://www.professorwatchlist.org/">Professor Watchlist</a>”, targeting supposedly radical professors on campus. <a href="https://www.campusreform.org/">Campus Reform</a> is an outlet devoted to reporting on liberal professors for their speech – for example, by student reports, social media usage or academic publications. For around a decade, Rod Dreher used his position as a senior editor at the American Conservative to target leftist academics, often to <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/tommy-curry-whose-remarks-on-race-made-him-a-target-is-leaving-the-u-s-for-scotland/">devastating effect</a>. And <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/410125/canary-mission-the-pro-israel-group-taking-credit-for-student-deportation-explained">Canary Mission</a> has steadily and for many years targeted professors for their advocacy for the Palestinian cause. These are hardly the only, or even the most powerful, outlets involved in this long assault (I have not even mentioned Fox News). University professors are terrified of being targeted by these organizations.</p> <p>Major mainstream media outlets have consistently failed to report on the rightwing media assault on college professors over the last two decades. This exacerbated the effects of these attacks. In 2016, when Dreher <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/swinburne-jason-stanley-homosexuality/">targeted</a> <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/jason-stanley-spirals-ever-downward/">me</a> in several posts for an offhand comment I made on a private Facebook post, I was inundated by hate mail and phone calls to my office. This was my first experience with such an attack; it deeply destabilized me. In the meantime, my colleagues assured me that Dreher was simply a worried liberal with the sorts of concerns about free speech on campus they had been reading about in the liberal media they consumed (Dreher has since moved to Budapest, Hungary, where he is a fellow at the Danube Institute, a thinktank funded by Viktor Orbán autocratic government).</p> <p>Finally, last year, the media committed its worst error yet, for months erasing the participation of sizable numbers of Jewish students in the protests on college campuses in support of divesting from US military support for Israel, including as movement leaders. In truth, there is a generational conflict about Israel among American Jews. As many American Jews under 40 <a href="https://www.jewishelectorateinstitute.org/p6971">believe</a> that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza as believe this claim to be antisemitic (about one-third). The media’s complete erasure of the large group of American Jews, especially younger American Jews, critical of Israel’s actions in Gaza, has allowed the Trump regime to conduct its dismantling of the US higher education system under the pretext of fighting antisemitism.</p> <p>None of this is to deny the obvious fact that college professors skew heavily Democratic. In some disciplines, there are clear reasons for this. Sociology has few Republican voters, because rightwing ideology since the 1980s has generally rejected its metaphysical presuppositions – such as the <a href="https://newlearningonline.com/new-learning/chapter-4/neoliberalism-more-recent-times/margaret-thatcher-theres-no-such-thing-as-society">existence and importance of societies</a>. Women and gender studies, Middle Eastern studies, and African American studies are disciplines whose very existence is directly and regularly attacked by Republican politicians. But the fact is that the partisan tilt of universities has basically nothing to do with these departments.</p> <p><a href="https://buckleyinstitute.com/content/uploads/2024/09/Faculty-Research-Report-2024_compressed.pdf">A study of my university</a> by a conservative campus group found that out of 23 professors in the chemistry department whose political affiliation could be identified, 19 were Democrats and one was a Republican. Astronomy, Earth and planetary sciences, economics, molecular biophysics and biochemistry were all departments with zero professors with Republican affiliations. According to this study, biology and biomedical sciences at Yale had 229 professors with Democratic party affiliations, and eight with Republican party affiliations. None of these are areas in which it makes sense to speak of political bias. As the “asymmetric polarization” of the Republican party has accelerated over the last decade, is it any wonder that there are fewer and fewer professors who vote for Trump’s Republican party? Why would academics vote for a party that is now bent on dismantling the US system of higher education? </p> <p>Unfortunately, instead of debunking the media-driven moral panic about leftists on campus, universities have largely accepted the premises of the drivers of this panic – that there is a problem on campus exemplified by the fact that few professors support Trump (“intellectual diversity”), and that protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza (with large representations of Jewish students) were antisemitic. Even universities that are challenging the Trump regime’s assault seem to accept its nonsensical premises that college students have been overly protected from controversial speech, and, simultaneously, that Jewish students must be shielded to the maximum extent of the law from criticism of Israel’s actions.</p> <p>In the meantime, the media has elevated some of the very academics most responsible for the moral panic, such as Steven Pinker, who has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/sep/28/steven-pinker-celebrity-scientist-at-the-centre-of-the-culture-wars">described universities</a> as having a “suffocating leftwing monoculture”, into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/opinion/harvard-university-trump-administration.html">spokespersons</a> for universities, and continues to trumpet the propaganda that led to this moment. For example, the New York Times columnist Thomas Edsall, who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/opinion/democrats-republicans-wokeness-cancel-culture.html">long</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/opinion/us-elites-populism.html">promoted</a> the moral panic about “wokeness” that fuels the Maga movement, still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/opinion/harvard-trump-vance.html">simply pre-supposes</a> that “ideological conformity and past failures to restrain antisemitism” are “vulnerabilities” of the current US higher education system.</p> <p>According to the agents of the moral panic, the blame for Trump’s all-out assault on the American system of higher education falls squarely on supposed “leftists on campus” whose actions supposedly undermined trust in these institutions. But the fault, instead, lies squarely with those responsible for <em>driving</em> this moral panic. The mainstream media has delivered the Republicans a win in a multidecade long propaganda war against academia, one that began with William F Buckley in the 1950s. Within the university, powerful actors are superficially standing against the Trump regime’s attack, while <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/4/30/Harvard-Fights-Retreats/?fbclid=IwY2xjawKFq89leHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFhVU8yblhoRGxTMHBneVhFAR5XHba-n4NCqnQrAl5zJRvJrY0J3nmrKhSUNE5CbmNpn9lw8VQLV6oAtU9YQA_aem_QjH_ZDOSVyEqxSA5wGNOow">implementing its agenda themselves</a> (giving the lie to the absurd pre-supposition that universities are run by gender studies departments).</p> <p>The “war on woke” is the calling card of the global fascist right. Orbán’s attack on Central European University for “gender ideology” began his destruction of Hungarian democracy. Putin justified his full-scale invasion of Ukraine by appealing to the supposed dangers Ukraine’s liberal democracy poses for traditional gender roles. Americans should hold mainstream media’s Trump enablers responsible for Trump and his actions, and not let them pretend otherwise. As we witness the entire research apparatus of the US being taken down in the name of attacking DEI, trans rights and antisemitism, the mainstream media must halt its absurd fantasy that leftists control universities, and focus instead on the problem it has spent the last decade enabling – namely, fascism.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jason Stanley is Jacob Urowsky professor of philosophy at Yale University.
