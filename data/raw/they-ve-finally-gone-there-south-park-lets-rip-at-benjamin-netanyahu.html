<p>In the three weeks since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/south-park">South Park</a> last aired, things have changed. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">assassination</a> of rightwing pundit Charlie Kirk exploded already fiery political tensions, with the Trump administration and its base embarking on a campaign of retribution the likes of which haven’t been seen since the McCarthy era, and stating, without sufficient evidence, that Kirk’s murder was the result of a wide-ranging leftist plot. Scores of people in the public and private sectors have been punished for commenting on the situation, most notably late-night host <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/24/jimmy-kimmel-says-trump-tried-his-best-to-cancel-him-as-his-show-returns-to-air-after-suspension">Jimmy Kimmel</a>, whose show was briefly pulled off air after the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/18/brendan-carr-fcc-jimmy-kimmel">Brendan Carr</a>, put parent company Disney under pressure to do so.</p> <p>Suffice to say, the situation is far too dire to worry about where a cartoon sitcom fits into it all, but South Park is a special case. The first episode of season 27 revolved around the politically motivated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/18/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-to-end-in-2026-as-cbs-cancels-show">cancellation</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, another late-night talkshow host critical of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, while the second directly lampooned Kirk.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/04/donald-trump-is-having-a-lovechild-with-satan-south-park-sets-up-future-chaos">Donald Trump is having a lovechild with Satan: South Park sets up future chaos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many on the right have declared South Park morally complicit in Kirk’s murder, despite the fact that Kirk himself <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/07/south-park-anti-deportation-episode-ice">celebrated</a> the parody (going so far as to use its caricature of him as his X profile picture). Repeats of that episode were pulled from Comedy Central, although it remains available to stream on Paramount+. Then, a week to the day after Kirk’s death, it was announced that the new episode of South Park would be postponed. This sparked speculation of censorship, although showrunners Matt Stone and Trey Parker roundly denied this, claiming it was simply a matter of a blown deadline (the result of their famously tight schedule).</p>    <p>While that seems like an all too convenient excuse, Parker and Stone have never backed down from controversy before. Then again, said controversy has never been this furious before, nor hit so close to home for them. The big question ahead of the newest episode was: what would South Park have to say about all this?</p> <p>The answer is … not much.</p> <p>The latest instalment, provocatively titled Conflict of Interest, makes no mention of Kirk, although it does tackle the aftermath in a roundabout way. In one of the two main storylines, Trump, upset over the impending birth of his unholy lovechild with Satan, sets a series of convoluted traps to force an abortion, only for Carr to continually wander into them. By the end of the episode, Carr, badly injured and hosting a brain parasite as a result of toxoplasmosis from being buried in a mountain of cat poo, is at risk of “losing his freedom of speech”.</p>    <p>Despite avoiding one of the touchiest subjects of the day, South Park steered headlong into another, finally addressing the genocide in Palestine by way of prediction market apps. A bet on one of the platforms – “Will Kyle’s mom strike Gaza and destroy a Palestinian hospital?” – grows so large that Kyle’s mom ends up flying to Israel to put a stop to it.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/10/south-park-simpsons-its-like-theyre-trying-to-get-prosecuted-when-cartoons-try-to-take-down-governments">‘It’s like they’re trying to get prosecuted’: when cartoons try to take down governments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For most of the episode, the outrage is directed at all sides, with Kyle angrily yelling: “Jews and Palestinians are not football teams that you bet on”, and his mother proclaiming: “It’s not Jews versus Palestine, it’s Israel versus Palestine!”</p> <p>However, that outrage is ultimately aimed at a specific party, with Kyle’s mom barging into the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and letting rip: “Just who do you think you are, killing thousands and flattening neighbourhoods, then wrapping yourself in Judaism like it’s some shield from criticism!” If Netanyahu’s comeuppance isn’t as scatologically extreme as Carr’s, it still provides a fleeting moment of catharsis.</p> <p>While not the most outrageous episode of the season, this may be the funniest, with the Looney Tunes-like gags and the prevalence of JD Vance’s impish caricature both earning huge laughs. And if this week’s South Park didn’t quite meet the moment head-on, neither did it back down. It’s good to know that it will continue to go after Trump and his cronies no matter how hot the political temperature grows.</p> <ul> <li><p>South Park is on Paramount+</p></li> </ul>
