<p>Low birthrates in Australia’s biggest cities deepened in 2024 amid sustained cost-of-living pressures, dragging the national rate to a near-record low. </p> <p>Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane each saw further declines in the number of children born per woman from 2023 to 2024, according to KPMG’s preliminary analysis of Australian Bureau of Statistics population data, barely offset by increases in Perth and in regional Australia.</p> <p>The analysis also found outer-suburban and regional Australians grew increasingly likely to have higher numbers of children per person than their inner-city neighbours.</p> <p>Overall the country’s fertility rate, or children born per woman, was 1.51 in 2024, statistically similar to the 1.5 observed in 2023 and well below the rate of 1.8 observed a decade beforehand.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Young families <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/11/global-birthrates-dropping">continued to delay or give up on having children</a> in the face of elevated living costs over the year, according to Amanda Davies, professor of demography at the University of Western Australia.</p> <p>“Not much has changed for people who are looking at having a family or thinking about extending their family; they are really struggling,” Davies said.</p> <p>“There’s a feeling they need to have secure housing before starting a family, and that extreme housing crisis that’s being faced in all parts of Australia is [related] to that declining fertility rate.”</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframeable/2019/03/choropleth_map_maker/v2/html/index.html?location=docsdata&amp;key=1-rJlWmIJzpUDDfbYv8sMeN8mDvX28vB3L-Lx9bykIvE" data-alt="Map"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframeable/2019/03/choropleth_map_maker/v2/html/index.html?location=docsdata&key=1-rJlWmIJzpUDDfbYv8sMeN8mDvX28vB3L-Lx9bykIvE">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Falling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/11/global-birthrates-dropping">confidence in the future</a> and changing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/18/slow-the-growth-save-the-world-why-declining-birth-rates-need-not-mean-an-end-to-prosperity">cultural expectations</a> have also contributed to a long-term decline in Australia’s fertility rates which has accelerated since the 2000s, according to economist Ashton De Silva.</p> <p>Inner-urban rates have fallen particularly far, with families pushed out of crowded capital cities by soaring costs for multi-bedroom homes, schools and hospitals.</p> <p>“Children are becoming more and more expensive,” said De Silva, a professor at RMIT University.</p> <p>“Unless something drastic changes, I would probably continue to expect to see that families are going to be located on the urban fringes.”</p> <p>Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane each saw fertility rates fall further in 2024, with the Victorian capital the lowest at 1.4, compared with 1.71 in 2014.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/15/homelessness-is-a-driver-of-poor-health-in-australia-so-why-not-make-housing-part-of-healthcare">Homelessness is a driver of poor health in Australia – so why not make housing part of healthcare?
