<p>Donald Trump has sent mixed signals about potential US intervention in Venezuela, playing down concerns of imminent war against the South American nation but saying its leader Nicolás Maduro’s days were numbered.</p> <p>The president’s remarks, made during a CBS interview released on Sunday, come as the US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/01/trump-maduro-venezuela-coups">amasses military units in the Caribbean</a> and has conducted multiple strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/rand-paul-trump-military-airstrikes-venezuela">killing dozens</a>.</p> <p>Asked during the 60 Minutes program if the US was going to war against Venezuela, Trump said: “I doubt it. I don’t think so.” However, when asked if Maduro’s days as president were numbered, he replied: “I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-venezuela-strikes-regime-change">Why is Trump, the self-proclaimed ‘president of peace’, aiming to topple the Venezuelan regime?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maduro, who faces indictment on drug charges in the US, has accused Washington of using drug trafficking as a pretext for “imposing regime change” in Caracas to seize Venezuelan oil.</p> <p>More than 15 US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific have killed at least 65 people in recent weeks, with the latest taking place on Saturday, prompting criticism from governments in the region.<br></p> <p>Washington has yet to make public any evidence that its targets were smuggling narcotics or posed a threat to the US.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/us-night-stalkers-caribbean-fears-regime-change-venezuela-nicolas-maduro">US ‘Night Stalkers’ seen in Caribbean as fears of regime change rise in Venezuela</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the same interview, Trump alleged countries including Russia and China had conducted underground nuclear tests unknown to the public, and that the US would test “like other countries do”.</p> <p>“Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it,” he told 60 Minutes.</p> <p>“I don’t want to be the only country that doesn’t test,” he said, adding North Korea and Pakistan to the list of nations allegedly testing their arsenals.</p> <p>Confusion has surrounded Trump’s order that the US begin testing, particularly if he meant conducting the country’s first nuclear explosion since 1992.</p> <p>Trump first made his surprise announcement in a social media post on Thursday, minutes before entering a summit with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, in South Korea, saying he had “instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis”.</p> <p>The announcement came after Russia said it had tested a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Burevestnik, and a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable underwater drone.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/trump-pentagon-us-nuclear-weapons">Trump directs Pentagon to match Russia and China in nuclear weapons testing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked directly if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than three decades, Trump told CBS: “I’m saying that we’re going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.”</p> <p>No country other than North Korea is known to have conducted a nuclear detonation for decades. Russia and China have not carried out such tests since 1990 and 1996, respectively.</p> <p>Pressed on the topic, Trump said: “They test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening with the test. You feel a little bit of a vibration.”</p> <p>However, Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, on Sunday downplayed any possible tests by the US, telling Fox News on Sunday: “I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions.”</p> <p>The US has been a signatory since 1996 to the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p> <p>Other topics addressed in the interview included:</p> <ul> <li><p>Trump said he “won’t be extorted” by Democrats to reopen the government, making clear that he has no plans to negotiate as the government shutdown will soon enter its sixth week.</p></li> <li><p>Asked to clarify whether he would try to run for a third term, which is barred by the constitution, Trump said: “I don’t even think about it,”</p></li> <li><p>Trump said immigration enforcement officials hadn’t gone far enough in deporting people who were in the country without legal authorisation.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>With Agence France-Presse</em></p>
