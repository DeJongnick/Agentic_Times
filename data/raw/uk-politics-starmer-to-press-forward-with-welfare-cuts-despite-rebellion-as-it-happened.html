  <p>You can keep up to date with the Guardian’s UK politics coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics">here</a>.</p> 
  <p>Here is a summary from today’s blog:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Prime minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/24/keir-starmer-disability-benefit-reforms-rebellion-by-mps">Keir Starmer said he would “press forward” with welfare cuts despite a looming rebellion from Labour MPs</a>. The move against the government’s ​benefit cuts included an amendment that could kill its ​welfare bill, spearheaded by senior select committee chairs. The amendment has been signed by 108 MPs. </strong>Asked whether he would consider pausing his plans in light of the rebellion, The prime minister told the Cabinet meeting this morning that the government “will reform welfare”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden has defended the government’s handling of a rebellion by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> MPs over welfare reform changes, and said the vote of the bill will go ahead as planned next week.</strong> McFadden said “We will see the vote next week. We will keep talking to people between now and the vote, but there is no escaping the need for reform of the welfare system.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Keir Starmer has defended Donald Trump’s actions in the Middle East, saying the US had alleviated a threat to the Iranians’ nuclear weaponry and brought about a ceasefire.</strong> The comments came after shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel criticised the government for being reluctant to give public support to US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Trump insisted in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday afternoon that the ceasefire he had brokered between the Middle East foes was “in effect”, after saying earlier that both Israel and Iran had violated the agreement.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Britain will commit to spending 5% of its GDP on defence by 2035, to which <strong>McFadden said the country was “not starting from zero”.</strong> The UK’s pledge aligns with Nato’s new spending targets – but at a slower pace than key allies including Poland. Britain pushed for and secured a later date.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Foreign secretary David Lammy said the government will invest £600m in its intelligence services, after an audit of relations with China. </strong>He said: “We are updating our state threat legislation following general review. We are strengthening our response to transnational repression.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer has confirmed that a second British evacuation flight will leave Israel today. </strong>He told the Commons the first RAF flight took place on Monday “and I can confirm to the House now that we will fly another today”.</p></li>

  <p>Shadow foreign secretary <strong>Priti Patel</strong> has accused Labour of going “cap in hand” to China to bail out the British economy and said the audit fails to set out a proper strategic framework.</p> 
  <p>She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>It has taken the Government a year to produce this audit, which seemingly fails to set out any kind of serious strategic framework.</em></p> 
   <p><em>I think it’s fair to say we know why: because the Government - and in fact the Foreign Secretary has touched on this - has gone cap in hand to China to bail out its terrible handling of the British economy.</em></p> 
   <p><em>It is setting up its closer economic ties with China while knowing very well that British businesses here are struggling, not just when it comes to competing against China, but actually struggling to absorb the weight of Labour’s own regulatory costs in this country.</em></p> 
   <p><em>So, can I ask the foreign secretary, and so far we have not seen it in this statement, whether or not he can name a single area where a measurable, tangible progress has been made in advancing critical British interests with China, whether it’s on national security, economic practices, on climate or on human rights?</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer praises US for 'bringing about a ceasefire in the early hours of today'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Keir Starmer has defended Donald Trump’s actions in the Middle East, saying the US had alleviated a threat to the Iranians’ nuclear weaponry and brought about a ceasefire.</strong></p> 
  <p>Asked whether he felt safer with the US president in charge, the prime minister told Channel 5 News:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Look, I think what we’ve seen over the last few days is the Americans alleviating a threat to nuclear weaponry by the Iranians and bringing about a ceasefire in the early hours of today.</em></p> 
   <p><em>I think now what needs to happen is that ceasefire needs to be maintained, and that will be the focus of our attention, our engagement, our discussions, because that ceasefire provides the space for the negotiations that need to take place.</em></p> 
   <p><em>It will have to be negotiations … to ensure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon capability and that is very important for safety and security, not just in the region, but more widely.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p> Trump insisted in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday afternoon that the ceasefire he had brokered between the Middle East foes was “in effect”, after saying earlier that both Israel and Iran had violated the agreement.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The Downing Street spokesperson has said that prime minister Keir Starmer told the Cabinet meeting this morning that the government “will reform welfare”.</strong></p> 
  <p>PA Media reports the spokesperson said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The prime minister opened Cabinet by setting out that the government has a clear mission to rebuild Britain, fix what is broken and restore hope, and that requires hard, honest choices.</p> 
   <p>He said nowhere is that clearer than in the welfare system the government inherited. He said the system is currently failing people, trapping millions, telling them the only way to get help is to declare they will never work again, and then abandoning them without hope and opportunity.</p> 
   <p>The prime minister underlined that the government does not accept that.</p> 
   <p>We will reform welfare to provide one-to-one support to help people try work safely, protect people with lifelong conditions from endless reassessments and increase the basic level of support for low-income families.</p> 
   <p>That means the government will always protect those who can’t work, will provide real opportunity for those who can and will build a welfare system that’s fair, strong and there for the people who need it for years to come.</p> 
   <p>He underlined this is a part of the government’s plan for change to make life better for working people. That includes building new council homes, expanding mental health support, raising the minimum wage, delivering more free school meals and creating good jobs across Britain.</p> 
   <p>The Work and Pensions Secretary [Lik Kendall] said these reforms are about creating a society rooted in fairness with strong safeguards to protect the most vulnerable. She said there is nothing responsible about denying disabled people who want to work the opportunity and support to do so.</p>

   <p>First, protect security at home, and we will do that by defending our territory, controlling our borders and making the UK a harder target for our enemies, one that is stronger and more resilient to future threats.</p> 
   <p>Secondly, promote strength abroad. This means bolstering our collective security, renewing and refreshing our key alliances, and developing new partnerships in strategic locations across the world. It also means a clear eyed view of how we engage with major powers like China.</p>

  <p>Foreign secretary <strong>David Lammy</strong> and shadow foreign secretary <strong>Priti Patel</strong> have had an exchange over the dispatch box about the conflict in the Middle East, and she specifically questioned him over the government’s plans for evacuations of British nationals in Israel.</p> 
  <p>Patel asked Lammy “Given the clear threat Iran poses to the UK, our allies and to the Middle East, does the foreign secretary support the actions undertaken by the US to degrade Iran’s nuclear weapons? And he will also have heard that President Trump has said that Iran’s nuclear capabilities are gone. Does he welcome this?”</p> 
  <p>Lammy side-stepped offering direct support for the strikes, saying “It was important to be alongside secretary of state Rubio last week in DC. We continue to work closely with president Trump, and the prime minister spoke to him just two days ago. And of course, the initial assessments of those attacks in Iran are coming in, and we will assess that in due course.”</p> 
  <p>Patel followed up by saying “given the situation that has emerged in the Middle East and the fact that deescalation has not taken place in recent hours, can the foreign secretary outline what is now effectively going to be quite an urgent situation in terms of measures that he’s overseeing to bring back 4,000 British nationals now stranded in Israel?”</p> 
  <p>The foreign secretary replied “we will do all we can to work with the Israeli government to open airspace and to continue flights. We have a ceasefire – I have seen, of course, that that ceasefire has been violated – and I urge all partners to keep to that cease fire so airspace can open up and commercial flights can resume.”</p>

  <p><strong>Colum Eastwood</strong>, who is SDLP MP for Foyle, has posted to social media to say he has added his name to the Reasoned Amendment to wreck Labour’s welfare bill. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’ve co-signed the Reasoned Amendment to decline a second reading to the Welfare and Pip Bill alongside more than 100 other MPs. The bill is a cruel and unconscionable attack on vulnerable people. We’ve tried to raise concerns, including directly with the prime minister. These plans are worse than the Tory welfare system. It will have a devastating impact on communities like Derry where we have 17,000 people on Pip because they need additional support to manage their disabilities. We have to do everything we can to fight these brutal cuts.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Former transport secretary <strong>Louise Haigh</strong> has also posted a message about the amendment this morning, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Disabled people have not been consulted and we have not given enough time for the government’s reforms on employment support to work. In the middle of a cost of living crisis, we cannot risk a rushed Bill taking money off disabled people.</p>

  <p><em>Frances Ryan reports for the Guardian:</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Downing Street’s disability cuts will have a “devastating” impact on women’s health and dignity and could breach equality law, the government has been warned.</strong></p> 
  <p>Charities and disabled people’s organisations including Scope, Spinal Injuries Association, Inclusion London, ME Association and WinVisible told the Guardian that tightening eligibility for personal independence payments (PIP) would mean disabled women being discriminated against, due to their higher personal care needs compared with men.</p> 
  <p>Under the new rules, to be voted on by MPs next week, a claimant must receive four points in a single daily living category to qualify for the payment.</p> 
  <p>Washing below the waist will score just two – half the number given to needing assistance between the shoulders and waist. It means the new four-point rule won’t take into account menstruation or some women’s extra toilet requirements, such as incontinence from pregnancy, unless they have additional needs.</p> 
  <p>More than 100 Labour MPs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/23/labour-mps-launch-major-rebellion-to-stop-benefits-cuts-bill">have signed a Commons bid to halt the cuts in their tracks</a>, enough to threaten Keir Starmer’s majority. Some 108 MPs’ signatures appear on an amendment declining to give the welfare reform bill a second reading when it returns to the Commons on 1 July. The rebellion, the prime minister’s largest yet, would be enough to defeat the government’s plans if opposition MPs joined the Labour rebels.</p>

  <p><em>Jamie Grierson has this write up of Pat McFadden’s appearance on the morning media round defending the government’s plans for welfare reform:</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Pat McFadden, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the government would “keep talking to people” after more than 100 Labour MPs signed up to a Commons bid to stop reforms to Pip.</strong></p> 
  <p>Pip was introduced by the coalition government in 2013 and is designed to help working-age people 16 and over with the extra costs of living with a health condition or a disability. It is available in England, Wales and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland">Northern Ireland</a>.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> government wants to tighten the eligibility for Pip as part of a wider package of changes aimed at saving £5bn a year.</p> 
  <p>An amendment put forward to the government’s welfare bill that declines to pass the government’s welfare changes and calls for a pause has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/23/labour-mps-launch-major-rebellion-to-stop-benefits-cuts-bill">signed by more than 100 Labour MPs</a>.</p> 
  <p>Rebel MPs aim to pass a so-called reasoned amendment, which halts the passage of a bill. It means the welfare bill would not pass its second reading, and says that provisions “have not been subject to a formal consultation with disabled people, or co-produced with them, or their carers”.</p> 
  <p>The amendment would need to be selected by the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and gain the support of opposition parties to pass, and there is no guarantee of either. But the symbolism of so many MPs signing the amendment would make taking the bill forward problematic for Keir Starmer.</p>

  <p><strong>Plaid Cymru have called for Wales to hold a national inquiry into maternity units, after health secretary Wes Streeting yesterday announced that England would hold one.</strong></p> 
  <p>Plaid Cymru health spokesperson, <strong>Mabon ap Gwynfor</strong>, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Wales has had the highest stillbirth rates in the UK since 2014, and while both England and Scotland experienced a decline in neonatal mortality rates between 2010 and 2022, they increased in Wales over this period.</p> 
   <p>In light of significant and well-publicised issues over recent years at several Welsh health boards, we have similar concerns as to the quality of maternity care here in Wales. Indeed, across several metrics, there is reason to believe that maternity services in Wales are currently in a worse state than those in England.</p> 
   <p>As was shown by the latest Llais report into the Singleton hospital maternity unit, a lack of institutional accountability is compounding clinical failures. Undertaking an investigation of this nature would go a long way towards rebuilding the trust of the public after years of deteriorating standards.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel has criticised the government for being reluctant to give public support to US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.</strong></p> 
  <p>In an appearance on GB News, she told viewers “the British government did not even come out to give a view, to give a view as to whether or not they supported American strikes on that Iranian nuclear facility. And that is not right. It is wrong. The British people need to know that.”</p> 
  <p>Patel also claimed that the actions of Iran “are affecting us every single day in this country,” saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have Iranian spies in our country. Iranian dissidents in our country. They’ve been active, and they’ve been undermining our national interests.</p> 
   <p>Yes, it is about the nuclear facilities in Iran. They must never have a nuclear weapon. Yes, it is about their ballistic missiles. Obviously, they’ve been stockpiling them. They’ve been hurting European countries on European soil, such as Ukraine, and they’ve been operating in our country.</p> 
   <p>That’s why we need a government that is going to invest in our defence and security and actually make sure that we are kept safe. Yes, abroad, when it comes to our bases and British nationals abroad, but also here in this country.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Yesterday several ministers declined to say whether they thought the US strikes were legal, with former foreign secretary <strong>James Cleverly</strong> describing current foreign secretary <strong>David Lammy</strong>’s interview on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme as “excrutiating”.</p> 
  <p>In 2017 Patel was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/08/priti-patel-forced-to-resign-over-unofficial-meetings-with-israelis">forced to resign from Theresa May’s government</a> after it emerged she had been holding about 14 unofficial meetings with Israeli ministers, businesspeople and a senior lobbyist.</p>

  <p>The UK government earlier cautiously welcomed the announcement of a ceasefire betweeen Israel and Iran. Speaking on BBC radio, senior minister <strong>Pat McFadden</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are living in a very unpredictable world. If this ceasefire holds, I think everyone will welcome that. But I think given the exchange of missiles in various directions over the last ten days or so, people will welcome it with caution, because it is a fragile situation.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In a separate appearance on BBC Breakfast, McFadden said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A number of people have been killed overnight in missile strikes, but I think the whole world will hope that the ceasefire will hold and that Iran will come forward with a credible plan that shows that it will not pursue the development of a nuclear weapon.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">UK government minister: 'not starting from zero' with increased spending on defence</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>A senior minister in the UK government has said the country is “not starting from zero” when it comes to raising defence spending to 5% of GDP.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking on the BBC, <strong>Pat McFadden</strong> said one of the earliest actions of his party, which came to power of 2024, was to increase defence expenditure to 2.5% of GDP over the next couple of years.</p> 
  <p>“It was not an easy decision,” he said, “but we said how we would pay for that, and similarly, as we increase beyond that over the next decade, in future spending reviews, will set out how it will be paid for.”</p> 
  <p>McFadden was keen to stress that the 5% figure of GDP was not just what he called “an out of date concept of defence and national security” that saw it “purely as the budget for the armed forces.”</p> 
  <p>He told listeners “Critical as that budget is and those capabilities are, you have to look after your broader security. Our cyber systems, for example, are under attack every day, sometimes by state actors, sometimes by non-state actors.</p> 
  <p>“That is why things like your telecoms infrastructure and other things that help to make our society work are a really important part of our security.”</p> 
  <p>He criticised the previous UK government, saying that under Rishi Sunak the Conservative party had a spending target of 2.5% but “no credible plan to reach it.”</p>

  <p>He continued:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>She has been central to the development of these reforms.</p> 
   <p>She has argued for them, not as a difficult choice, but as the right choice, because she believes in a welfare state that should be there for people.</p> 
   <p>Because she’s not comfortable about 1,000 people a day signing on for Pip and us just watching that number grow.</p> 
   <p>And because she’s absolutely passionate about getting more help and support to long term sick and disabled people who could work if they had that extra help and support, and right now, under the unreformed system, they don’t have that.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster <strong>Pat McFadden</strong> has defended the government’s handling of a rebellion by Labour MPs over welfare reform changes, and said the vote of the bill will go ahead as planned next week.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, McFadden said “We will see the vote next week. We will keep talking to people between now and the vote, but there is no escaping the need for reform of the welfare system.”</p> 
  <p>He said the UK faced “a decade which is set to see the number of people on long term sickness and disability benefits double,” claiming that “1,000 people a day go on to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pip">Pip</a>” which he said was the equivalent of “a city the size of, for example, Leicester” every year. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are an outlier in terms of the proportion of people in work in the UK compared to other countries, when you look back at what it was before Covid.</p> 
   <p>And so the set of reforms that we brought forward are aimed at ensuring the welfare state is there for people who need it.</p> 
   <p>It should always be there for people who need it in the future, but also making sure that, as the party of labour, as the party of work, we have support in place for that proportion of people on long term sickness and disability benefits who could work if they were given support.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>On the rebel MPs, McFadden said “Of course, we’ll engage with people … we’ll always have a dialogue with people … you know, welfare reform is not an easy issue, and to govern is sometimes to have to grasp issues that aren’t easy.”</p>
