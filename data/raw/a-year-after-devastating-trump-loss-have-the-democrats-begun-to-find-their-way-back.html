<p>It has been a year of soul-searching, hand-wringing, and self-flagellation for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> after a ballot-box rejection so thorough that some had come to believe that the party had lost not only the White House and Congress but <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5183075/did-democrats-lose-on-the-economy-or-the-culture-wars-three-strategists-weigh-in">the culture itself</a>.</p> <p>Shell-shocked, Democrats entered Donald Trump’s second term in a political stupor – unsure of who they were or what they stood for. Their base had lost faith in its aging leadership class, and their brand, in Democrats’ own words, had become “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/us/politics/newsom-democrats-toxic.html">toxic</a>”: a party increasingly confined to coastal states, big cities and college towns. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/politics/presidential-election-2024-red-shift.html">even there</a>, warning signs were flashing.</p> <p>Then came Tuesday night – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/democrat-election-wins-across-america-caution-around-hope-mamdani-spanberger">a coast-to-coast romp</a> in the first major elections of Trump’s turbulent return to the White House that exceeded even the party’s most optimistic projections.</p> <p>“What a night for the Democratic party,” California governor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom </a>marveled, after news networks projected the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result"> redistricting ballot measure</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/gavin-newsom-prop-50-democrats-hope">he spearheaded</a> had passed so decisively that some voters were still in line to cast ballots. “A party that is in its ascendancy,” he continued, “a party that’s on its toes, no longer on its heels.”</p> <p>Abigail Spanberger, a congresswoman and former CIA agent, stormed to victory in Virginia, becoming the first woman elected governor of the state, an office currently held by a Republican. In New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill, another congresswoman and former Navy pilot, turned what was expected to be a close race into a rout. And in New York, Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist, made history by vanquishing the former three-term Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo to become the city’s first Muslim mayor, in a race that drew the highest turnout in decades.</p> <p>“Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship,” Spanberger proclaimed in her victory speech, while in New York, Mamdani celebrated “a new era of leadership” and declared that “no longer will we have to open a history book for proof that Democrats can dare to be great”.</p> <p>Their wins did little to resolve the big, existential questions of whether Democrats’ future lay in a full-throated adoption of leftwing populism or a tactical turn to pragmatic centrism. The night offered ammunition for either path, or perhaps both.</p> <p>Yet a year after Kamala Harris’s concession to Trump, Democrats have repeatedly found success not by picking a single ideological lane, but by embracing the forces of disruption that have dominated Trump-era politics. Their victories, while strikingly different in style and approach, point to a party less bound by orthodoxy and old notions of decorum – a recognition that the times have changed, and so must they.</p> <p>“This is not your grandfather’s Democratic party,” Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said the next morning. “We are not going to play with one hand behind our back. We’re not going to roll over. We’re going to meet you, fire with fire.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>For much of the past decade, Democrats cast themselves as guardians of the system – defenders of the democratic institutions under siege by a “wrecking ball” former builder who bulldozed his way into the White House and then clawed his way back.</p> <p>After the tumult of Trump’s first term, Democrats turned to Joe Biden, a consensus-builder and institutionalist who <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bidens-legacy-bookended-by-two-trump-victories/">once predicted </a>that history would view his adversary “as an aberrant moment in time”. In office, Biden dedicated his presidency to restoring domestic political norms while preserving the liberal international order abroad. But with his legacy now framed by Trump’s re-election, many Democrats have abandoned Biden’s return-to-normalcy appeal, seeing it as ill-suited to the politcal moment. </p> <p>Instead, as Trump moves aggressively to consolidate power and tilt the electoral map in his favor, the party’s instincts have shifted sharply away from caution, yet many progressives felt they had been too slow to adapt. Shortly before the 2024 election, a survey found that the overwhelming majority of voters <a href="https://data.blueroseresearch.org/hubfs/2024%20Blue%20Rose%20Research%20Retrospective.pdf">valued</a> a candidate who could deliver “change that improves people’s lives” rather than one who was committed to preserving institutions.</p> <p>Tensions built earlier this year, when angry Democrats began calling on their leaders in Washington and in state capitols around the country to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/05/democrats-healthcare-government-shutdown">do something</a> – anything – to stop Trump’s attacks on the federal government, the rule of law and his political opponents. Those fears grew into the No Kings protest movement, which saw an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/no-kings-protest-trump-what-next">estimated 7 million people</a> in all 50 states take <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/20/no-kings-protests-trump-democrats">to the streets</a> last month.</p> <p>Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible, argued that Tuesday’s wins, following mass days of protest, were proof that a more combative and less deferential politics was the way to defeat Trumpism. “The No Kings era is here to stay,” he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ezralevin.bsky.social/post/3m4u4tnr2b222">wrote</a>.</p> <p>That assertive posture extended to Capitol Hill, where Senate Democrats are refusing to lend the votes needed to reopen the government – now the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/government-shutdown-longest-history"> longest federal shutdown in US history </a>- unless Republicans extend healthcare subsidies: a bare-knuckle approach they had resisted as recently as few months ago.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the redistricting battles unfolding across the states, party leaders and longtime champions of fair maps including Barack Obama campaigned for California’s retaliatory gerrymander, as Newsom called on other Democratic governors to follow suit.</p>    <p>“Politics has changed. The world has changed,” Newsom, a likely 2028 presidential contender, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHYojjPCY34&amp;themeRefresh=1">told</a> NBC earlier this month. “The rules of the game have changed.”</p> <p>In nearly every election held this year, Democrats improved on their 2024 showing. Exit polls in Virginia and New Jersey show that both governors-elect not only held their base but<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/upshot/election-turnout-trump-hispanics.html"> peeled off</a> Trump voters, while re-engaging young men and Latino voters who defected in 2024. In New York, Mamdani saw enormous youth turnout for his candidacy.</p> <p>“On Tuesday night, we saw a lot of different kinds of Democrats win – and that’s kind of the point,” said Rebecca Katz, a veteran political strategist whose political firm, Fight, worked for Mamdani’s campaign. “To win big, we need a big tent.”</p> <p>Voters, she said, sent a clear message that a<strong> </strong>back-to-basics formula – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/republicans-election-losses-affordability-trump">a relentless focus on improving affordability</a> and a campaign built around authentic and visible candidates – resonates.</p> <p>Katz, who also advised the successful swing-state Senate campaigns of John Fetterman in 2022 and Ruben Gallego in 2024, argued that the central divide in the party was no longer where a candidate falls on the moderate to liberal spectrum but a choice between boldness and caution: “Playing it safe is the riskiest thing Democrats could do right now.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Winning has given the wounded party a much-needed morale boost. In a fundraising appeal this week, Democrats told supporters to “remember this feeling”. Yet beneath the celebration, the old fault lines – over age, ideology, tactics, and style – still run deep.</p> <p>Several seasoned House Democrats are facing contentious primary challenges, fueled by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/nancy-pelosi-retire-congress">generational impatience</a> and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/23/new-generation-democrats-congress-elections">desire for the party</a> to take a more combative approach to Trump. Democrats’ prospects in 2026 may hinge on whether progressives and moderates can unite behind a message that addresses both economic anxiety and the fears of Trump’s presidency.</p> <p>In 2028, Democrats say they need a nominee who can articulate a vision beyond their opposition to Trump, the glue that has held together a Bernie Sanders-to-Liz Cheney coalition.</p> <p>Appearing at a live taping of the podcast Pod Save America this week, Obama said it was exhilarating to see progressives “get off the mat”. But, he added, “we’ve got a lot of work to do” and cautioned progressives in the audience against pushing ideological “litmus tests”.</p> <p>“We had Abigail Spanberger win and we had Zohran Mamdani win,” the former president said, “and they are all part of a vision for the future.”</p> <p>Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator who campaigned for Mamdani, told reporters this week that ideological divisions in the party were “no great secret”.</p> <p>But he sensed a party-wide shift: “I think there is a growing understanding that leadership and defending the status quo and the inequalities that exist in America is not where the American people are.”</p> <p>Republicans have sought to downplay Democrats’ string of victories this year. Since 2016, Democrats have tended to perform better when Trump was not on the ballot, their coalition proving more reliable in off-year and special elections.</p> <p>“They say that I wasn’t on the ballot and was the biggest factor,” Trump <a href="https://vimeo.com/1133860683?fl=pl&amp;fe=sh">said</a> this week. “I don’t know about that. But I was honored that they said that.”</p> <p>Historically, the party out of power typically fares well in the midterm elections. But redistricting efforts are expected to tilt the 2026 House map toward Republicans. In the Senate, the task is even more daunting for Democrats, who will have to win in states Trump carried by double digits. While Trump’s plunging popularity has Republicans worried, Americans hold markedly <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/10/30/how-americans-feel-about-the-republican-and-democratic-parties/">negative views</a> of the Democratic party as well.</p> <p>Still, Democrats see momentum building in parts of the country where they haven’t been competitive for years.</p> <p>This summer, Catelin Drey, a Democrat and first-time candidate, won a special election for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/25/iowa-state-senate-race">a state senate seat </a>in Iowa, breaking the Republican supermajority by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/catelin-drey-democrat-wins-iowa-state-senate-election">flipping a district</a> that backed Trump in the 2024 election. It was a consequential victory and one that gave Democrats a jolt of hope.</p> <p>For weeks after her election, she kept getting the same question: how did she pull it off?</p> <p>“I knocked on thousands of doors,” said Drey, 38, a mother whose campaign centered on affordability, especially the rising cost of childcare. “I had people tell me, ‘I’ve never had a candidate come to my door before,’” she said. “Seeing that kind of work ethic – having someone show up and say, ‘Yeah, life is really tough right now. What’s the hardest thing for you? How can I help? What would make things better?’ That type of attention is not what we’re seeing across the board right now.”</p> <p>Since Harris’s defeat last November, Democrats have produced a glut of election postmortems, polling memos and policy white papers offering theories about why they lost — and how to win again. Drey thinks the answer might be surprisingly simple.</p> <p>“Show up and work for the people you serve,” she said. “It’s not rocket science.”</p>
