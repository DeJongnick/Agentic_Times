<p>The role of mental health issues and disability in youth unemployment will be examined by the former Labour health secretary Alan Milburn as part of a review looking into rising inactivity among Britain’s young people.</p> <p>Nearly a million people aged 16 to 24 are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/07/dudley-uk-epicentre-youth-jobs-crisis-unemployment">not in education, employment or training</a>, often described with the acronym Neets. Milburn will look at ways to avoid people becoming trapped as Neets and the findings will be published in the summer.</p> <p>The government announced the review four days after publishing the findings of another <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/02/young-people-job-training-jobless-britain-problem">review</a>, by the former John Lewis boss Charlie Mayfield, which said “young adults” aged 16 to 34 were one of the key cohorts affected by an “economic inactivity crisis”.</p> <p>The number of 16- to 34-year-olds with a mental health condition who are economically inactive due to long-term sickness rose by three-quarters, or 190,000, between 2019 and 2024, Mayfield’s review found.</p> <p>While a series of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/youth-review-summary-findings-and-government-response/youth-review-summary-findings-and-government-response">reviews</a>, <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/causes-of-youth-unemployment-lords-committee-report/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">reports</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/get-britain-working-white-paper/get-britain-working-white-paper">white papers</a> have diagnosed the problems, successive Conservative and Labour governments have struggled to arrest the increase in Neets.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/02/young-people-job-training-jobless-britain-problem"> A million young people aren’t in a job or training. Britain has a problem | Richard Partington</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is expected to announce funding in this month’s budget for a “youth guarantee” to offer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/29/rachel-reeves-warns-labour-figures-against-ditching-idea-relaxing-fiscal-rules">guaranteed paid work</a> to every eligible young person who has been on universal credit for 18 months without earning or learning.</p> <p>Pat McFadden, the secretary of state for work and pensions, said: “The rising number of young people who are not in education, employment or training is a crisis of opportunity that demands more action to give them the chance to learn or earn. We cannot afford to lose a generation of young people to a life on benefits, with no work prospects and not enough hope.”</p> <p>The Department for Work and Pensions said Milburn’s review would “make practical recommendations to help young people with health conditions access work, training or education – ensuring they are supported to thrive, not sidelined”.</p> <p>It said the findings would complement yet another review, the Timms review, which is looking at the personal independence payment, which covers the extra costs of physical and mental disabilities.</p> <p>Milburn was health secretary from 1999 to 2003 under Tony Blair, and was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/15/alan-milburn-to-be-given-lead-role-in-labours-health-ministry">appointed last year</a> as the lead non-executive director of the Department of Health and Social Care.</p> <p>He said he would be “uncompromising in exposing failures in employment support, education, skills, health and welfare and will produce far-reaching recommendations for change to enhance opportunities for young people to learn and earn”.</p>
