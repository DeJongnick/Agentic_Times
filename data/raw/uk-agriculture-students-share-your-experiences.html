<p>Agricultural colleges across the UK have seen a significant increase in applications for land management courses, <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/education/article/clarksons-farm-boosts-agricultural-college-applications-x9l270s07">according to the Times</a>. Applications for the Royal Agricultural University’s three-year rural land management BSc course, for example, have risen 11 per cent compared to 2024. The rise is part of a wider increase in applications to study farming-related courses at UK universities in recent years.</p> <p>We would like to hear from agriculture students about their reasons for enrolling. What influenced your decision? Are you the first in your family to work in the industry? Or have members of your family worked in agriculture?</p> <h2>This Community callout closed on 23 October 2025.</h2> <p>• You can contribute to open Community callouts <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-community-team">here</a> or Share a story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/sep/02/guardianwitness-send-us-a-story">here</a>.</strong></p>
