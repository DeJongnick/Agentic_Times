The three-month hearing that opened at London’s high court on Monday will focus on vehicles sold by five manufacturers - Mercedes, Ford, Renault, Nissan and Peugeot/Citroen - from 2009. In “real-world” conditions, when driven on the road, lawyers argue, the cars produced much higher levels of emissions.</p> <p>The judgment on the five lead defendants will also bind other manufacturers including <strong>Jaguar Land Rover</strong>, <strong>Vauxhall/Opel</strong>, <strong>Volkswagen/Porsche</strong>, <strong>BMW</strong>, <strong>FCA/Suzuki</strong>, <strong>Volvo</strong>, <strong>Hyundai-Kia</strong>, <strong>Toyota</strong> and <strong>Mazda</strong>, whose cases are not being heard to reduce the case time and costs.</p> <p>Lawyers for the defendants will make opening statements later this week.
