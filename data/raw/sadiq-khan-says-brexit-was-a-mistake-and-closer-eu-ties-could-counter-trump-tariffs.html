<p>Sadiq Khan has told EU diplomats Brexit was a mistake and called on the UK government to be bold as it looks to strengthen ties with the bloc, arguing this would act as a counterweight to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/13/trump-tariffs">tariffs threatened by Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>The mayor of London told the EU ambassador and the UK ambassadors to the 27 member states at a meeting on Tuesday that Britain’s departure from the union “continues to have a negative impact” on the country and its capital city, and vowed he would make the case for closer alignment.</p> <p>Five years after Brexit, Keir Starmer’s government has described <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/05/keir-starmer-uk-european-union-brexit-reset">resetting relations with the EU</a> as a priority, but it has ruled out a return to the single market, rejoining the customs union or allowing freedom of movement.</p> <p>It has also resisted proposals from Brussels for a new scheme to allow under-30s from the bloc to live, study and work in the UK and vice versa.</p> <p>Khan told the ambassadors he supported the government’s push for closer relations, and that he was strongly in favour of a new youth mobility scheme.</p> <p>“This would help to aid economic growth across Europe, but also give young Londoners and EU citizens important life experiences - like the opportunity to work abroad and learn more about our respective languages and cultures,” he said.</p> <p>“As part of this, I’m keen for us to look at how we can make it easier for schoolchildren from the EU to visit the UK and learn more about our shared ties and history.”</p> <p>Describing himself as a proud European, Khan urged allies on the continent to come together to tackle a series of shared challenges including “the rise of an intolerant and anti-democratic populism” and “tariffs posing a real threat to international affairs”.</p> <p>Amid the prospect of trade wars and tariffs from Donald Trump’s administration, Khan said a strengthened UK-EU relationship could act as a counterweight.</p> <p>His comments come after the Labour government publicly rebuked him over his earlier warnings of “resurgent fascism” under a new Trump presidency.</p> <p>Sonny Leong, who as a Lords whip holds the same constitutional position as a minister, said he disagreed with Khan and that Trump “has a mandate and we have to work with him”. “Sometimes I would say a period of silence would be most welcome,” he said.</p> <p>Khan highlighted the AfD party in Germany, the National Rally in France and Trump in the US and called them “opportunists who seek to divide people for personal and political gain” in an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/18/sadiq-khan-far-right-billionaire-bullies">article for the Observer</a> in January<em>.</em></p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to resetting the relationship with the EU to improve the British people’s security, safety and prosperity. But we have been clear there will be no return to freedom of movement, the customs union or the single market.”</p>
