<p>Donald Trump’s approval rating has fallen to one of its lowest points, with only 37% of Americans expressing approval of his performance as president.</p> <p>The new CNN/SSRS<a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26211915/cnn-poll-trump-midterms-east-wing-parties.pdf"> survey</a> released on Monday shows a sharp decline in Trump’s approval ratings compared with the early days after he began his second term in January, when his approval<a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26211915/cnn-poll-trump-midterms-east-wing-parties.pdf"> stood at</a> 47% by mid-February.</p> <p>The latest survey, conducted among 1,245 adults from 27 to 30 October, shows a 63% disapproval rating, just a percentage point higher than his lowest mark ever recorded by CNN, which came in the week following the January 6 Capitol Hill riot in 2021.</p> <p>When asked how things are going in the US, today, a majority of Americans, 68%, said “pretty/very badly”, while 32% said “very/fairly well”.</p> <p>The survey, conducted as the federal government appears to enter what will be the longest shutdown in American history, also found that 47% of Americans view the economy and cost of living as the most important issue facing the country.</p> <p>Coming in second is the state of American democracy, indicated by 26% of Americans. By comparison, only 10% cited immigration as a top concern, even though the issue continues to be a major focus of Trump’s administration, marked by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/trump-ice-leadership-deportations">intensified ICE raids</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-refugee-restrictions-white-south-africans">steep cuts</a> to refugee admissions and ongoing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/19/trump-immigration-cuba-asylum-seeker">immigration</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/02/judge-blocks-trump-birthright-citizenship">battles </a>in federal courts.</p> <p>Other issues lower on the list include crime and safety, cited as a concern by only 7% of Americans, despite Trump’s vow to rid major American cities – which he has called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/trump-jail-brandon-johnson-jb-pritzker-chicago-illinois">“hellhole” </a>and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/19/portland-oregon-residents-trump-housing-drugs">“war-ravaged” </a>– of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/trump-washington-dc-crime-los-angeles">“crime, bloodshed, bedlam”</a>.</p> <p>Among those surveyed, only 27% said they believe Trump’s policies improved the nation’s economic conditions. In contrast, 61% think his policies made the economy worse while 12% believe they had no effect. The survey comes amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/02/trump-economic-agenda-republican-heartland-tariffs">growing concern</a> in rural Republican towns where Trump’s tariffs have driven factory layoffs and production slowdowns across various industries.</p> <p>In regards to foreign policy, 32% said they believe Trump’s decisions helped the US’s global standing. By contrast, 56% believe that he hurt the US’s standing in the world while 12% said he made no difference at all. These results follow repeated White House <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/466269/trump-peace-deals-ended-wars">claims</a> that Trump has ended eight wars in eight months of his presidency.</p> <p>Moreover, the survey found that a majority of Americans, 61%, believe Trump has gone too far in using his presidential powers. Meanwhile, 31% say his use of power has been about right, and 9% believe he has not gone far enough.</p> <p>Since taking office in January, Trump’s expansion of his presidential authority – through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/06/trump-expansion-of-presidential-powers">actions</a> including authorizing international strikes without congressional approval, deploying national guard troops despite opposition from state officials, and issuing executive orders that make independent regulators answerable to the White House – has raised <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/trump-authoritarianism-warning">widespread concern</a>.</p> <p>The survey’s findings on public attitudes toward Trump’s presidential power also come as experts warn that his investigations into political opponents risk turning the justice department into his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/04/trump-justice-department">“personal weapon”</a>.</p> <p>With the midterm elections coming up next November, 41% of Americans said that if they were voting for Congress today, their vote would be a way to show opposition to Trump. Meanwhile, 21% said their vote would signal support for Trump and 38% said their vote would not be about sending any message to him.</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted the White House for comment.</p>
