 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The United Nations voiced grave concerns on Wednesday about food and other supplies running out in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people were already experiencing famine, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> closed the only crossing there last week. </strong>Israel began its long-expected ground assault on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> City in the north on Tuesday and is stepping up efforts to empty the city of civilians by opening an additional route southwards.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>At least 50 people were killed by Israeli strikes and gunfire across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including 39 in Gaza City, local health authorities said. </strong>They said the latest fatalities took the Palestinian death toll from the two-year war between Israel and Hamas past 65,000.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has described the Gaza Strip as a “real estate bonanza” and said he is in talks with the US about dividing it up after the war, The Times of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> reports. </strong>Speaking at a real estate conference in Tel Aviv, Smotrich said the destruction in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> is “the first stage in the city’s renewal”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The<strong> Gaza</strong> <strong>health ministry</strong> said an <strong>Israeli</strong> drone had dropped grenades on one floor of the <strong>Rantissi children’s hospital</strong> on Wednesday. No casualties were reported but the ministry said 40 families took their children away, reports Reuters.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> on Wednesday condemned “in the strongest terms” the <strong>Israeli</strong> ground operation in <strong>Gaza City</strong>, a day after <strong>Israel</strong> unleashed a long-threatened ground assault on the territory. The kingdom also urged members of the <strong>UN security council</strong> to act to halt what it described as Israel’s killing, starvation and forced displacement of <strong>Palestinians</strong>, the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The <strong>International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)</strong> has been in touch to share an update on the situation from <strong>Gaza</strong> via a <strong>Palestinian</strong> staff member in the territory. Writing on Wednesday, <strong>Ahmed Al Waheidi</strong> said those fleeing the north for the south face “congested, damaged and dangerous” roads, with journeys taking “hours”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A Catholic priest in Gaza city has vowed to stay in his church compound to help look after 450 people who have taken refugee there in the face of the ground assault launched by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>. </strong>Carlos Ferrero told RTÉ they were “scared” and many of them felt that even if they did follow Israeli instructions and evacuate to the south of the City they were in peril.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The European Commission has proposed <strong>suspending some of the trade parts of the EU-Israel association agreement</strong>, 18 months after Ireland and Spain asked the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to review the agreement in light of the war in Gaza. Following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/ursula-von-der-leyen-suspension-eu-trade-israel">her state of the union speech last week indicating a shift at the top of the EU</a>, the commission’s presented a proposal today.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The <strong>World Health Organization (WHO</strong>) said that it had supported the medical evacuations of 10 “critical” children from <strong>Gaza</strong> to the <strong>UK</strong>. These children were evacuated with 50 companions, the WHO said. The PA news agency reports that the UK government said that it is working to make sure families receive “appropriate support” during their stay. More children are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The <strong>Israeli</strong> army said it has struck more than 150 targets in <strong>Gaza</strong> <strong>City</strong> since launching a major ground offensive on the <strong>Gaza</strong> <strong>Strip</strong>’s main urban hub early on Tuesday. “Over the past two days, the [Israeli air force] and artillery corps troops struck over 150 terror targets throughout <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> City in support of the manoeuvring troops in the area,” the military said in a statement issued on Wednesday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>China</strong> said on Wednesday it “firmly opposes” the escalation of military operations in <strong>Gaza</strong> after <strong>Israel</strong> launched a major ground assault on <strong>Gaza City</strong>. “China firmly opposes Israel’s escalation of military operations in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> and condemns all acts that harm civilians and violate international law,” foreign ministry spokesperson <strong>Lin Jian</strong> said of the massive bombardment of Gaza City, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Pope Leo XVI</strong> expressed solidarity with the population of <strong>Gaza</strong> on Wednesday, saying that civilians had been “once again” forced from their land and were living in “unacceptable conditions”, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “I express my deep solidarity with the Palestinian people in Gaza who continue to live in fear and survive in unacceptable conditions, being forcibly displaced once again from their lands,” said the 70-year-old pope after his general audience.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">UN warns on supplies for famine-stricken north Gaza after Israel shuts crossing</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The United Nations voiced grave concerns on Wednesday about food and other supplies running out in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people were already experiencing famine, after Israel closed the only crossing there last week.</strong></p> 
  <p>Israel began its long-expected ground assault on Gaza City in the north on Tuesday and is stepping up efforts to empty the city of civilians by opening an additional route southwards.</p> 
  <p>Hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering in the city and many are reluctant to follow Israel’s orders to move because of the dangers along the way, dire conditions, a lack of food in the southern area, and fear of permanent displacement.</p> 
  <p>“There are grave concerns over fuel and food stock depletion in a matter of days as there are now no direct aid entry points into northern Gaza and resupply from south to north is increasingly challenging due to mounting road congestion and insecurity,” the UN humanitarian office (OCHA) said in a statement.</p> 
  <p>The Zikim Crossing was shut on 12 September and no aid groups have been able to import supplies since, it said.</p>

  <p>The <strong>UK</strong>’s <strong>Green party</strong> leader <strong>Zack Polanski</strong> said he would be “standing up to the bully Donald Trump and his poodle, Nigel Farage” before joining protesters in <strong>London</strong> later on Wednesday. He also accused Trump of seeking to “whitewash his own complicity in the genocide unfolding in Gaza”.</p> 
  <p>Polanski, who is in the lineup for a rally on <strong>Parliament Square</strong> organised by the <strong>Stop Trump Coalition</strong>, said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Donald Trump comes to Britain seeking credibility and to whitewash his own complicity in the genocide unfolding in Gaza. </p> 
   <p>While the vast majority unite against Trump and everything he stands for, there will be one man who wants us to welcome him with open arms: Nigel Farage. Farage pretends to be a man of the people, but he’s really just a man of the super rich. Like Trump he seeks power, influence and money over all else. </p> 
   <p>Our country has a proud tradition of standing up for the underdog. Today, that means standing alongside every child in Gaza; with all those in detention camps on the borders of the United States and with each and every one of those growing up in poverty here in Britain. And standing up to the bully Donald Trump and his poodle, Nigel Farage.</p>

  <p>Today’s proposal by the European Commission to suspend trade parts of the EU Israeli association <strong>would not mean Israeli goods disappearing from European supermarkets</strong>, factories, or hospitals.</p> 
  <p>If adopted by the member states, who need to agree to it under qualified majority vote system (QMV), <strong>it would merely mean goods would no longer be duty free and subject to tariffs that apply to all non-EU countries</strong> that do not have a trade agreement with the bloc.</p> 
  <p>The EU is responsible for 32% of Israel’s total trade in goods with the world, selling some €16bn in 2024.</p> 
  <p>Israeli exports include everything from jet engines to pharmaceuticals including those from Teva. However, <strong>not all goods are exported under tariffs,</strong> as they are for example not imposed on pharmaceuticals under a longstanding World Trade Organization agreement.</p> 
  <p>Under the QMV system <strong>two conditions have to be met.</strong> 55% of member states need to back to the move. This means 15 out of 27 member states, but the bigger barrier is that the proposal must be supported by member states representing 65% of the total EU population.</p> 
  <p>Germany represents 18% of the EU population, France 15% and Italy 11%.</p> 
  <p><strong>Maroš Šefčovič</strong>, the trade commissioner, admitted that <strong>the impact of the removal of free trade access, would be “modest”,</strong> as he told reporters that their suggestions that tariffs would amount to an additional cost of just €227m a year were “correct”.</p> 
  <p>Whatever its economic consequences, <strong>it can be seen as a hugely symbolic move.</strong></p> 
  <p>“I would say <strong>the whole context of the decision was very political</strong>. … I think there was strong expectations that European Union have to use the tools at its disposal to address the humanitarian crisis,” he said.</p> 
  <p>EU’s top diplomat, <strong>Kaja Kallas</strong>, was also asked about whether she was confident about getting the suspension approved by the member states.</p> 
  <p>She said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“You know very well, how is the situation the council, although we see that … <strong>the public opinion in member states is really shifting because the suffering in Gaza and people really want to see [this stopped].</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>I think we will have the discussions after these proposals are made, but I think the political lines are very much in the place where they have been so far.”</em></p>

  <p>Writing on Wednesday, <strong>Ahmed Al Waheidi</strong> said those fleeing the north for the south face “congested, damaged and dangerous” roads, with journeys taking “hours”.</p> 
  <p>In his update, he wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I left my wife and children in the north yesterday and travelled six hours to come and look for somewhere we could stay in Deir al-Balah. I want to call them every five minutes and check that they are OK or not – it is a constant fear knowing the hostilities are so close to them. The other day, a building was damaged within only fifty metres of them. The constant sound of explosions is terrifying for them, and they can feel the blast impacts – shaking walls and shock waves of dust – from hundreds of meters away. This is what it’s like every day for people. Many wake thinking the situation cannot get worse, but it continues to deteriorate. </p> 
   <p>When I find somewhere, I will go back and get my family, but we don’t know yet how we will move our belongings down here. There are not enough trucks for people to use, and it’s too expensive for many people. Hundreds of families are losing their homes every day, and the vast majority cannot afford the cost of being displaced and moving to the south, so they are sleeping in the streets. </p> 
   <p>My wife’s nephew was severely injured recently, and we are his last remaining family. I don’t know how we will move him from the north down to here. My mind is overwhelmed with all the decisions we have to make and the lack of choices for any of them. </p> 
   <p>The roads are congested, damaged, and dangerous, with the few working vehicles in poor condition. Journeys take hours, often on foot, with no clear destination. Elderly or sick family members arrive exhausted in the south, where even here, many are left to sleep along the roads until they can find shelter.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the press conference, <strong>Kallas rejected suggestions that the EU has not done enough to put pressure on Israel</strong> and <strong>insisted the public opinion has shifted on this in recent months</strong>, as reflected by the proposed measures.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>The proposals [are] now on the table to put more pressure on Israeli government</strong> … now it’s up to the member states to discuss [them] in the council, which is problematic, as we know of the lines.</em></p> 
   <p><em>But <strong>what it shows, really, it shows that the public opinion in all the member states has, has really shifted.</strong> And when we have the discussions, all the member states or representatives, foreign ministers, agree that the situation is untenable.</em></p> 
   <p><em>So if we all agree on this, then <strong>the question is, what do we do about this; what are the tools in our hands?</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>And that’s why we have proposed, then from our commission, to go with these proposals. If these do not fly, then we can find other things, if we all agree that we need to do additional steps in order to have really change on the ground.”</em></p>

  <blockquote class="quoted">

  <p>Following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/ursula-von-der-leyen-suspension-eu-trade-israel">her state of the union speech last week indicating a shift at the top of the EU</a>, the commission’s presented a proposal today.</p> 
  <p>In addition it has announced it had put <strong>bilateral support for Israel on hold</strong> with the exception of contributions to support civil society and the Yad Vashem holocaust museum.</p> 
  <p>And it has <strong>proposed sanctions on Hamas, extremist ministers and violent settlers</strong>.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, the EU said the proposal on the trade agreement follows a review of Article 2 of the deal following “the blockade of humanitarian aid, the intensifying of military operations and the decision of the Israeli authorities to advance the settlement plan in the so-called E1 area of the West Bank”.</p> 
  <p>The proposed suspension must be ratified by member states who are already blocking a European Commission proposal to suspend Israel from part of the Horizon European science research programme.</p>

  <p><strong>Sally Rooney</strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/deborah-levy">Deborah Levy</a></strong>, <strong>Nobel</strong> laureate <strong>Annie Ernaux</strong> and <strong>Pulitzer</strong> winner <strong>Viet Thanh Nguyen</strong> are among 20 authors urging <strong>French</strong> president <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> to resume a “lifeline” programme for evacuating <strong>Palestinian</strong> writers, scholars and artists from <strong>Gaza</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The <strong><a href="https://www.programmepause.fr/en/">Pause</a> programme</strong> for writers and artists in emergency situations, as well as a student evacuation programme, were abruptly suspended by the French government at the beginning of August over a Palestinian student’s allegedly antisemitic online remarks, a decision that the letter-writing authors said amounted to a “collective punishment”.</p> 
  <p>“As writers, we urge you to restore this lifeline as soon as possible, and to call on other heads of state to create similar programmes”, says the letter, which was sent to Macron’s office on Friday.</p> 
  <p>Further signatories include Nobel laureates <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/abdulrazak-gurnah">Abdulrazak Gurnah</a></strong> and <strong>JMG Le Clézio</strong> along with <strong>Anne Enright</strong>, <strong>Leïla Slimani</strong>, <strong>Madeleine Thien</strong>, <strong>Édouard Louis</strong>, <strong>Isabella Hammad</strong>, <strong>Didier Eribon</strong>, <strong>Naomi Klein</strong>, <strong>Max Porter</strong>, <strong>Alain Damasio</strong>, <strong>Mathias Énard</strong>, <strong>Kapka Kassabova</strong>, <strong>Karim Kattan</strong> and <strong>Rashid Khalidi</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The Pause programme was set up by the French government and the <strong>Collège de France</strong> in 2017 to help foreign researchers, scientists, intellectuals and artists who find themselves in emergency situations. It has since been used to offer French talent visas and give practical support for people from <strong>Ukraine</strong>, <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong> and other countries.</p> 
  <p>Since the start of the war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> in October 2023, a total of 31 Palestinian artists, writers and academics and their families have been sheltered in France through Pause and France’s student evacuation programme.</p> 
  <p>However, on 1 August, foreign minister <strong>Jean-Noël Barrot</strong> announced that “no evacuation of any kind” would continue while authorities were investigating allegedly antisemitic statements shared by a female student who had arrived in France from Gaza in July and was due to start attending classes at <strong>Sciences Po Lille University</strong> in the autumn.</p> 
  <p>“This suspension of evacuation programmes on the basis of one case of a racist social media post is a form of collective punishment at a time when all signatories to the Genocide Conventions should be doing their utmost to save Palestinians from annihilation and should refuse to be complicit in crimes against humanity”, the appeal to the president says.</p>

  <p>The <strong>World Health Organization (WHO</strong>) said that it had supported the medical evacuations of 10 “critical” children from <strong>Gaza</strong> to the <strong>UK</strong>. These children were evacuated with 50 companions, the WHO said. </p> 
  <p>The PA news agency reports that the UK government said that it is working to make sure families receive “appropriate support” during their stay. More children are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.</p> 
  <p>On Monday it was reported that two children and their families arrived in <strong>Scotland</strong> from Gaza for treatment. </p> 
  <p>A small number of children have already been brought to the UK for specialist medical care via an initiative by <strong>Project Pure Hope,</strong> and they are being treated privately. </p> 
  <p>In the UK, a cross-government taskforce has been working over recent weeks to coordinate the evacuation of these children, with officials describing it as a “complex humanitarian operation”. </p> 
  <p>Officials said that the children and their immediate family members were evacuated from Gaza to <strong>Jordan</strong>, where they were supported by <strong>British embassy</strong> staff and “robust” security checks were undertaken prior to their arrival into the UK. It comes as the UK government said that it is pushing Israel to ensure better protection for healthcare workers and medical infrastructure in Gaza. </p> 
  <p>UK foreign secretary <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong> said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>As we welcome the first group of children to the UK for urgent treatment, their arrival reflects our determined commitment to humanitarian action and the power of international cooperation. </p>

  <p>The decision on Israel’s inclusion will be made by the contest’s governing body in December, but SBS told the Guardian on Tuesday it intended to participate in the 2026 event in <strong>Vienna</strong>, regardless of December’s decision.</p> 
  <p>The deadline for broadcasters to file their applications for participation was initially to expire on Monday, followed by a 28-day grace period during which a country could subsequently withdraw its application without incurring a financial penalty.</p> 
  <p>But earlier this month the <strong>European Broadcasting Union (EBU)</strong> announced the Eurovision song contest reference group had decided to extend the deadline to mid-December, with the event’s director, <strong>Martin Green</strong>, issuing a statement saying he wanted to provide “additional flexibility and clarity” while the group undertook consultation with member broadcasters about country participation in next year’s event.</p> 
  <p><strong>Ireland</strong>, <strong>Slovenia</strong>, <strong>Spain</strong>, <strong>the Netherlands</strong> and <strong>Iceland</strong> have already signalled they are unwilling to participate if the EBU permits Israel to compete, as the humanitarian crisis in <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a></strong> continues to intensify.</p> 
  <p>The EBU excluded <strong>Russia</strong> from the competition shortly after its invasion of <strong>Ukraine</strong> in 2022.</p>

  <p>The bombardment of <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> City</strong> has been growing louder and more deadly for weeks, but in the early hours of Tuesday it felt like an earthquake that would never stop.</p> 
  <p>“Even when the bombings are not right next to us, we can clearly hear them, and the ground shakes beneath us with the intensity of the explosions,” said <strong>Fatima al-Zahra Sahweil</strong>, 40.</p> 
  <p>Sahweil, a media researcher, said the dead and wounded from the night’s barrage had been taken to <strong>al-Shifa medical complex</strong>, where she heard the situation was “catastrophic”.</p> 
  <p>She had lost track of the latest news, however, as she tried to make the near-impossible decision of what to do to best protect her four children.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Rashid coast road</strong>, the Israeli-designated “escape” route to the south, was jammed with the exhausted and desperate. Anyway, the cost of a ride was too high.</p> 
  <p>“On top of that, I don’t own a tent to give us shelter, and they are too expensive to buy. I would not be able to take all of the belongings and supplies I have already bought several times before,” Sahweil said. “Then there is the suffering we would face in searching for water and the lack of empty spaces to stay in. So if I leave, I would simply be going into the unknown.”</p> 
  <p>Like more than 90% of people in <strong>Gaza</strong>, the family has been displaced by the war. An overwhelming majority have been forced to move numerous times. Sahweil and her family have already been displaced 19 times.</p> 
  <p>Now, with the launch of a ground offensive, the <strong>Israeli</strong> army is calling on the estimated 1 million people sheltering in Gaza City to move south once more.

 <h2 class="block-title">Israel announces ‘temporary’ route for residents to flee Gaza City</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Israel</strong> announced on Wednesday a “temporary” new route for residents to flee <strong>Gaza City</strong>, as it launched an intense ground offensive after massive bombardment of the <strong>Palestinian</strong> territory’s main city.</p> 
  <p>The Israeli military “announces the opening of a temporary transportation route via Salah al-Din street”, spokesperson <strong>Avichay Adraee</strong> said in a statement, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Adraee added that “the route will be open for 48 hours only”.</p> 
  <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-launches-ground-offensive-deep-inside-gaza-city">Israel unleashed its long-threatened ground offensive in Gaza City</a>, sending tanks and remote-controlled armoured cars packed with explosives into its streets, in defiance of international criticism and the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-committed-genocide-in-gaza-says-un-inquiry"> findings of a </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-committed-genocide-in-gaza-says-un-inquiry">UN</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-committed-genocide-in-gaza-says-un-inquiry"> commission that it was committing genocide in the Palestinian territory</a>. <strong>Israel’s</strong> <strong>foreign ministry</strong> rejected the commission’s report as “distorted and false”.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s military said that it expects its Gaza City offensive to take “several months” to complete, marking the first timeline it has given for its plan to take control of the territory’s largest population centre.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s prime minister, <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></strong>, said the goals of the offensive were “defeating the enemy and evacuating the population”, omitting any mention of the freeing of the remaining Israeli hostages, which was been a constantly stated war aim until now. Hostage families and their supporters protested near Netanyahu’s <strong>Jerusalem</strong> residence on Tuesday, accusing him of abandoning their loved ones.</p> 
  <p>The UN secretary general, <strong>António Guterres</strong>, said it was clear that Israel had no interest in a peaceful outcome.</p> 
  <p>“Israel is determined to go up to the end and [is] not open to a serious negotiation for a ceasefire, with dramatic consequences from Israel’s point of view,” Guterres said.</p> 
  <p>More on this story in a moment. Here are other recent developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The health ministry in Gaza reported on Tuesday afternoon that 59 people had been killed and 386 wounded in the previous 24 hours, bringing the official toll of Palestinians from nearly two years of war to almost 65,000.</strong> The actual number is feared to be significantly higher.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>On Wednesday, the European Commission is due to present a plan to member states to impose “measures to pressure the Israeli government to change course over the war in Gaza”, said the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.</strong>“Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza will make an already desperate situation even worse,” Kallas said, adding: “It will mean more death, more destruction [and] more displacement.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iranian authorities hanged a man on Wednesday after convicting him of spying for Israel’s the Mossad intelligence agency since 2022, the judiciary said. </strong>“Babak Shahbazi … was executed by hanging this morning following due legal process and the confirmation of his sentence by the supreme court,” the judiciary’s Mizan Online news website said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Australian broadcaster SBS has indicated it will not follow the lead of a growing number of European Union countries and boycott next year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eurovision">Eurovision</a> song contest if Israel is permitted to compete. </strong>The decision on Israel’s inclusion will be made by the contest’s governing body in December, but SBS told the Guardian on Tuesday it intended to participate in the 2026 event in Vienna, regardless of December’s decision.</p></li>
