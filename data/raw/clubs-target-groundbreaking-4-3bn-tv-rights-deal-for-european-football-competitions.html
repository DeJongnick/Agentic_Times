<p>Europe’s top clubs are aiming to secure at least €5bn (£4.3bn) annually from the sale of television rights to Champions League, Europa League and Conference League games in the next cycle, potentially sealing a 10% increase on their existing value.</p> 
<p>The first media rights tenders for the period between 2027 and 2033 will be launched this month. In a groundbreaking move, one game in each matchweek could be streamed globally by the same provider, which would have the first pick from that round of games. It leaves open the possibility that Disney or Netflix could screen men’s Champions League games.</p>

<p>Champions League clubs take about 75% of rights earnings, which stand at £2.9bn across the current cycle. The rights for Europe’s five major markets – England, France, Italy, Germany and Spain – will go to tender at once, leaving open the opportunity for one broadcaster to but them for all five countries rather than their being sold piecemeal.</p> 
<p>It will be the first major challenge for UC3, the joint venture created between Uefa and European Football Clubs. The latter was known as the European Club Association until a glitzy relaunch at its general assembly in Rome this week. Relevent Sports, the American events promoter, was appointed this year as UC3’s global marketing and sales partner.</p> 
<p>On Wednesday the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, addressed delegates in Rome and, without referring explicitly to the rights tenders, acknowledged the need to innovate in broadcast deals.</p> 
<p>“Together we are building something unique with ambition, to deliver the most engaging football, the most innovative and the most accessible, to expand our core revenue streams,” Ceferin said.</p>

    <p>Footballers should respect the money they make and their employers, Serie A's chief executive, Luigi De Siervo, said on Wednesday in response to the Milan midfielder Adrien Rabiot's concerns over his club's planned league match against Como in Perth, Australia, in February.</p>
    <p>Rabiot called the decision crazy when he spoke to the French newspaper Le Figaro on Tuesday.&nbsp;"I was surprised when I learned that AC Milan will be playing a Serie A match against Como ... in Australia," Rabiot said.&nbsp;"It's completely crazy. But these are financial agreements to give visibility to the league, things that are beyond us.</p>
    <p>There's a lot of talk about schedules and player health, but this all seems truly absurd. It's crazy to travel so many miles for a match between two Italian teams in Australia. We have to adapt, as always."</p>
    <p>De Siervo was asked about Rabiot's remarks that these decisions are taken without the input of players.&nbsp;"He's right, but Rabiot forgets, like all footballers who earn millions of euros, that they are paid to carry out an activity, to play football," De Siervo told reporters.</p>
    <p>"He should have respect for the money he earns, complying with the wishes of his employer, Milan, who accepted and pushed for this match to be played abroad." <b>Reuters</b></p>
