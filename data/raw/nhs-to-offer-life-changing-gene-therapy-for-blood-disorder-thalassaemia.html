<p>People living with a rare genetic blood disorder in England will be offered a “life-changing” new treatment on the NHS, in what has been described as a historic moment.</p> <p>Casgevy, which is a one-off gene therapy, has been approved for use on the NHS in England for people living with a severe form of thalassaemia.</p> <p>The treatment was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) on Wednesday, meaning that about 460 patients currently living with transfusion-dependent beta thalassaemia could be eligible for the treatment.</p> <p>Thalassaemia is the name for a group of inherited blood disorders in which too little haemoglobin is produced by the body. It affects about 2,300 people in the UK, who are mainly from a Mediterranean, Asian, or Middle Eastern background. Many people with beta thalassaemia are not expected to live beyond their 50s.</p> <p>Casgevy works by editing a gene in a recipient’s bone marrow stem cells so that the body produces functioning haemoglobin.</p> <p>The therapy is hoped to be a lifetime cure. In international clinical trials, 93% of patients with beta thalassaemia did not need a blood transfusion for at least a year after having the treatment.</p> <p>Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of the NHS, said: “This is a historic moment for people living with beta thalassaemia, with a potential cure for those facing this debilitating disorder now available on the NHS.</p> <p>“Ordinarily, patients experience painful side effects and undergo regular transfusions, which severely impact their quality of life, but this therapy offers people a life free from that, as well as the hope of living longer, which is truly amazing news.</p> <p>“This is the latest in a series of revolutionary gene therapies to be secured by NHS England over the past five years, bringing significant benefit for patients – and thanks to funding through our Innovative Medicines Fund, this one-off therapy will be fast-tracked to patients who could benefit from the new lease of life it promises.”</p> <p>Prof Bola Owolabi, the director of the National Healthcare Inequalities Improvement Programme at NHS England, said: “This is an incredibly exciting step forward in the treatment of thalassaemia and could drastically change the lives of those living with what can be an extremely painful condition.</p> <p>“We are committed to reducing healthcare inequalities by rolling out new and pioneering treatments on the NHS for conditions, such as thalassaemia, which disproportionally affects people from some minority ethnic backgrounds.”</p> <p>Romaine Maharaj, the executive director of the UK Thalassaemia Society, said:<strong> </strong>“With Nice’s approval of gene therapy for transfusion-dependent thalassaemia under the NHS managed access scheme, we stand on the brink of a revolutionary breakthrough.</p> <p>“This transformative treatment offers patients a life-changing opportunity, enabling them to repair their own cells and embrace a future free from the challenges of their condition.</p> <p>“It is a beacon of hope that underscores the power of innovation in medicine, paving the way for curative options that can truly enhance the quality of life for everyone affected.”</p>
