<p>Independent and organic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-farm-workers">farmers</a> say chaos created by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s cuts has hurt their businesses, even as the US health secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, praises small farms and regenerative agriculture.</p> <p>The split-screen for small and organic farms – which one farmer described as the administration “talking out of both sides of their mouth” – comes on the heels of the release of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/22/rfk-maha-health-report-children">“Maha” report</a>. The White House document mentions farms, farmers and farming 21 times, and argues conventional agriculture has led to more ultra-processed foods.</p> <p>“Reading that report, it’s like a small-scale organic farmer’s dream,” said Seth Kroeck as he slammed the door on his 1993 F350 truck. Kroeck owns the organic Crystal Spring Farm, 331 acres (135 hectares) in Brunswick, Maine. “But then at the same time, [secretary of agriculture] Brooke Rollins’s name is on this – she’s proposing to cut two-thirds of the agriculture budget.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/23/trump-farmers-policy">Trump vowed to help US farmers. These four say his policies are ‘wreaking havoc’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kroeck had just finished planting 2,500 brussels sprouts and one-10th of an acre of specialty peppers. He still needed to fix a flat on a piece of farm equipment that day. He said small-scale farmers have promoted local, organic and whole foods for decades.</p> <p>While Kroeck is presumably the kind of farmer Kennedy would laud, all he finds is frustration with the administration, and actions that will “undoubtedly” make food more expensive.</p> <p>“We’re dealing with two personalities with our government,” said Kroeck.</p> <p>As conventional farmers <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jr-plans-may-face-gop-opposition/story?id=116285082">decry</a> the Maha report’s criticism of agricultural chemicals such as atrazine and glyphosate (the active ingredient in RoundUp), some <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/2025/03/chaos-and-panic-as-us-slashes-funds-for-small-farmers-and-food-assistance/">organic and independent farmers</a> have found that the meager government support they depend on has been upended by an administration that claims it wants to support them.</p> <p>“Farmers are the backbone of America – and the most innovative and productive in the world,” the report, led by Kennedy, argued. “We continue to feed the world as the largest food exporter. The greatest step the United States can take to reverse childhood chronic disease is to put whole foods produced by American farmers and ranchers at the center of healthcare.”</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Reading that report, it’s like a small-scale organic farmer's dream.

For instance, they cut a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tribal-food-grant-cuts-trump-rfk-jr">program</a> that helped tribal food banks provide healthy food and ended a <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/trump-admin-cuts-program-that-brought-local-food-to-school-cafeterias/2025/03">$660m program</a> that brought <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/19/farm-to-school-meals-funding-cut">fresh local foods to school cafeterias</a>. In just one example of impact, the cut quickly ended <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/22/us-news/nyc-cans-fresh-fruit-in-schools-amid-federal-cuts-a-shame/">fruit and vegetable</a> snacks in New York City schools.</p> <p>“This is a huge deal for small farmers,” Ellee Igoe told the <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/2025/03/chaos-and-panic-as-us-slashes-funds-for-small-farmers-and-food-assistance/">New Lede</a> publication in March. Igoe is a co-owner of <a href="https://www.solidarityfarmsd.com/">Solidarity Farm</a> in southern California. “We’re growing healthy food and providing it to local communities. And they are cancelling contracts without real reason. Out here, it feels like it is very politically motivated.”</p> <p>In just one example of direct impact to Kroeck, the Trump administration fired most of the staffers at Kroeck’s local Natural Resources Conservation Service <a href="https://thisistopeka.com/2025/02/the-nrcs-layoffs-understanding-the-cuts-and-the-misconceptions-about-conservation/">(NRCS) office</a>, an arm of the US Department of Agriculture that provides technical assistance to farmers, including on-site visits. The staff shrank from six to one – only the director remains.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/28/farmworkers-h-2a-trump-agriculture">Trump has no plan for who will grow US food: ‘There is just flat out nobody to work’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“In my book, she’s a superwoman, but how long is that going to last?” said Kroeck. “And what farmer is going to want to take on new contracts when it’s going to take her months and months and months just to return a call?”</p> <p>Kroeck also criticized the Maha report for including apparently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/29/rfk-jr-maha-health-report-studies">invented scientific references</a>.</p> <p>“The citations in the report seem to be made up by ChatGPT – this is crazy,” said Kroeck, who said he’s not a cheerleader for occupants of ivory towers, but “we do have to have some standards”.</p> <p>Groups such as the <a href="https://ota.com/news-center/message-our-members-health-begins-farm-otas-response-maha-report">Organic Trade Association</a> have largely echoed Kroeck’s sentiments, noting that this is what the organic movement has been saying all along and they need money.</p> <p>“We’ve long known that health begins on the farm and encourage the administration to invest in meaningful policies that expand access to organic for consumers,” said co-CEO Matthew Dillon in a statement to the Guardian.</p> <p>While some organic farmers say their relationship with the government has always been tenuous, small farmers say chaos has only worsened that relationship. Coastal wild blueberry farmer Nicolas Lindholm said at least a portion of the funding he was expecting for the year – to mulch his blueberries with wood chips – was “dead in the water”.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>We had applied for three different funding programs ... as of February all three of them were basically frozen</p> <footer> <cite>Nicolas Lindholm, blueberry farmer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“My wife and I have an organic wild blueberry farm here on the coast of Maine,” said Lindholm.</p> <p>“Over the past five months, we had applied for three different funding programs – all different – and finalized them through December and into January – and as of February all three of them were basically frozen.” Like many farmers, Lindholm’s needs were time-sensitive: blueberries can only be mulched every two years because of their growing cycle.</p> <p>In addition to direct cuts by the administration, congressional Republicans proposed cuts to food programs that indirectly benefit farmers. House Republicans passed a bill proposing <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/house-reconciliation-bill-proposes-deepest-snap-cut-in-history-would-take">$300bn in cuts</a> to food stamps, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), to fund tax cuts. They have also proposed cuts to a food program that helps <a href="https://www.nwica.org/press-releases/food-and-nutrition-organizations-speak-out-against-trumps-proposed-cuts-to-wics-fruit-and-vegetable-benefit">new mothers and babies</a> buy fruits and vegetables.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/30/farmers-trump-tariffs">Bleak outlook for US farmers – and Trump tariffs could make it worse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The panic within conventional agriculture communities has also been pronounced – with pointed criticism of the report coming before it was even published. Corn and soybeans dominate American cash crops, accounting for $131.9bn in <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/chart-detail?chartId=76946">receipts in 2023</a>, versus just $54.8bn in all<em> </em>fruits, vegetables and nuts combined.</p> <p>“It’s no secret you were involved in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/climate/atrazine-manosphere-maha-kennedy.html">pesticide litigation</a> before you became secretary,” said Cindy Hyde-Smith, a Republican senator for Mississippi, to Kennedy, leading into a question about the need for glyphosate (the active ingredient in RoundUp), and asking whether Kennedy could be impartial.</p> <p>Kennedy, who went on to pledge he would not put “a single farmer” out of business, said: “There’s nobody that has a greater commitment to the American farmer than we do – the Maha movement collapses if we can’t partner with the American farmer.”</p>
