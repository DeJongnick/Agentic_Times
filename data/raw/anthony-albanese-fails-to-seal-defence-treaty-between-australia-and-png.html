<p>Anthony Albanese’s strategy of pushing back against China in the Pacific has been dealt another blow, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/16/australia-png-papua-new-guinea-military-defence-treaty-agreement-as-china-pacific-influence-grows">a major defence treaty</a> with Papua New Guinea delayed amid concerns about sovereignty.</p> <p>A deal was expected with the former Australian colony this week but the prime minister is set to leave Port Moresby without signing the so-called Pukpuk mutual defence treaty with his counterpart, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/papua-new-guinea-independence-50th-anniversary-png-world-leaders">James Marape</a>, on Wednesday.</p> <p>Albanese downplayed the delay earlier this week, suggesting cabinet deliberations had been held up due to commemorations of PNG’s independence. Instead the two governments signed a joint communique and pledged to continue negotiations on the wider defence pact.</p> <p>It is the second such delay in as many weeks for Albanese.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Before this month’s Pacific Islands Forum, Vanuatu’s government paused the signing of a joint agreement with Australia, saying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/09/albanese-went-to-vanuatu-to-sign-a-500m-agreement-but-leaves-empty-handed-thanks-to-concerns-about-china">more work was needed</a> on the question of critical minerals funding from China.</p> <p>The PNG deal is expected to lock the two countries into joint defence arrangements in the event of a military attack, and to allow citizens of both countries to serve in the defence forces of the other.</p> <p>Joint training exercises, better technical interoperability and new cooperation on cybersecurity preparedness are all envisaged.</p> <p>Albanese has pushed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/12/explainer-inside-png-nrl-deal-how-the-licence-was-won-and-what-comes-next">deal for PNG to enter the NRL in 2028</a>, part of the $600m agreement which has served as a major diplomatic sweetener.

There is no downside in this whatsoever. This is all upside for Australia and upside for Papua New Guinea.”</p> <p>Marape said PNG’s defence capability was not sufficient to defend the country and its people, making shared security settings with Australia necessary.</p> <p>He stressed that the new treaty was PNG’s proposal, not Australia’s, and that it would not affect PNG’s sovereignty.</p> <p>“A security treaty for Papua New Guinea would be the highest, in terms of secure relations we have given to any country,” he said.</p> <p>“The threats that face us are exposed to Australia. Threats that face Australia are exposed to Papua New Guinea.”</p> <p>But retired major general Jerry Singirok, the Papua New Guinea defence force commander in the 1990s, accused Albanese of trying to “ambush” Marape and the PNG cabinet. </p> <p>“If the constitution is not amended it violates our constitution. Australia’s threat is not ours,” he told Guardian Australia. </p> <p>“Why can’t they recruit their own? If Papua New Guineans want to join ADF, they should give up PNG citizenship and become Australian.” </p> <p>PNG’s foreign minister, Justin Tkatchenko, called the deal “a work in progress”, indicating it was yet to be signed off by cabinet. Ministers are due to meet again next week.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, accused the government of rushing for photo opportunities, instead of carefully executing foreign policy. </p> <p>“Anthony Albanese failed his own test,” she said. “He has failed to plan for the risks in our region. </p> <p>“This is a serious foreign policy embarrassment on his watch.” </p> <p> The Nakamal agreement with Vanuatu had been expected to be signed earlier this month. That deal would see Australia spend up to $500m over a decade <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/09/albanese-went-to-vanuatu-to-sign-a-500m-agreement-but-leaves-empty-handed-thanks-to-concerns-about-china">on climate change resilience, security services and the economy</a>.</p> <p>Labor believes both agreements can still be signed in coming months.</p> <p>China has used infrastructure funding and loan agreements to build influence with Pacific Island countries, undercutting Australia’s ties with the region and testing the country’s diplomatic reach.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
