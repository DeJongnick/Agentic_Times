<p>The conservative news outlet Newsmax agreed to pay the voting equipment company Smartmatic $40m last year as part of a settlement in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/defamation-law">defamation</a> suit over Newsmax’s decision to broadcast false claims about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020">2020 election</a>, a new filing revealed.</p> <p>The parties did not reveal details of the settlement when it was reached in September, but Newsmax disclosed the settlement amount in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2026478/000121390025021989/ea0233655-253g1_newsmax.htm">a public 7 March financial filing</a>. The news outlet said it had also offered Smartmatic the option to buy stock in the company and that it had paid $20m of the settlement amount so far.</p> <p>A Newsmax spokesperson declined to comment beyond <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/us/newsmax-smartmatic-case/2024/11/30/id/1189881/">the statement</a> the company issued after the settlement last year.</p> <p>Smartmatic voting equipment was only used in one jurisdiction in the United States during the 2020 election. Nonetheless, allies of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and other conservative outlets repeated false claims that the company hacked votes and sent them overseas.</p> <p>Smartmatic sued Newsmax, the far-right network One America News and Fox for defamation, claiming they broadcast false claims about the company after the 2020 election. It previously settled with One America News and the case against Fox is ongoing. In January, A New York appellate judge said the company’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/10/nx-s1-5256432/smartmatic-fox-news-trial-defamation-election-2020-trump">$2.7bn suit against Fox could proceed</a>.</p> <p>Fox agreed to pay Dominion voting systems, another voting equipment company, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/18/fox-dominion-settle-us-defamation-lawsuit">$787.5m to settle</a> a defamation suit over election claims in 2023.</p> <p>All of the cases are being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/election-lies-misinformation-media">closely watched</a> by first amendment scholars as tests of whether libel law could be an effective tool for curbing misinformation. In the case between Dominion and Fox, for example, the legal process made public internal Fox messages showing prominent hosts and key personnel were aware the information about the company was false.</p>
