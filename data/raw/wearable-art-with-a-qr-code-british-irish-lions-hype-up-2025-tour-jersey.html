<p>Seldom in the history of sports kit has more breathless hype surrounded the launch of a humble rugby jersey. “A masterpiece” and “a wearable piece of art” were among the gushing tributes paid to the shirt the players will wear on next year’s men’s British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, which does admittedly look slightly different to its predecessors.</p> <p>In a “seamless tapestry” the emblems of all four home nations have been woven into the fabric and there is even a tag on the garment which, if scanned, allows supporters to tap into an app containing extra rugby-related digital content.</p> <p>Described as a “bold yet classic look” the design also incorporates “a grandad collar” and is a slightly deeper shade of red, as well as being slightly simpler for bulkier forwards to remove than some skin-tight jerseys have been in the past, with the former Ireland and Lions winger Tommy Bowe recalling that it once took four players to prise the shirt off the back of their ex-Ireland teammate Mike Ross.</p> <p>While they are now familiar with the jersey they will wear, however, the 2025 Lions are still not entirely sure about the identity of every team they will be playing. Following the demise of the Melbourne Rebels, there is still no firm confirmation of the opposition Andy Farrell’s touring side will face in their scheduled fixture in Melbourne on 22 July, four days before the second Test in the same city.</p> <p>Ieuan Evans, the Lions chair, has stressed, however, that he expects the Wallabies to provide a sterner challenge in the three-Test series than some currently envisage. “I fully expect significant improvement under Joe Schmidt,” said Evans. “They’re a proud sporting and rugby nation and it’s 12 years since they last faced the Lions. Their focus will be on producing a formidable team to oppose us in the Test series. I fully expect them to be in a strong position come the tour.”</p>
