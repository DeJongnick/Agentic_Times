<p> Limited action on gambling reform and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/05/nsw-gamblers-losing-24m-to-poker-machines-every-day-analysis-shows-ntwnfb">record levels of harm</a> have prompted “an unholy alliance” between the Greens and the Australian Christian Lobby (ACL), which has pledged to rally support for the progressive party’s legislation.</p> <p>The offer of support came shortly after NSW Greens MLC Cate Faehrmann announced a bill to force the closure of all poker machine venues from 2am to 10am and remove exemptions for more than 650 pubs and clubs that can operate within this period.</p> <p>The exemptions – which have been provided to about 20% poker machine venues – were<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/22/nsw-anonymous-gambling-laws-pokies-poker-machines-2028-leaked-report-ntwnfb"> criticised by the government’s independent expert panel</a> advising on policy reform.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/12/nsw-government-failing-to-measure-or-reduce-gambling-harm-damning-audit-finds"> A subsequent audit report</a> also called for them to be reviewed.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The ACL wrote to Faehrmann’s office with congratulations last month and an offer to support the bill however it could. A spokesperson told the Greens they were horrified that some venues were able to operate when gambling harm was highest.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/17/chris-minns-accused-of-misrepresenting-cashless-gaming-trial-after-labelling-it-ineffective">Chris Minns accused of misrepresenting cashless gaming trial after labelling it ‘ineffective’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While initially being told to wait until November for more information, the ACL pressed for as much detail as possible so it could rally support behind the bill in a public campaign later this month. It also flagged the involvement of churches and prayer groups.</p> <p>The ACL’s chief executive officer, Michelle Pearse, said the lobby group would not drop its criticism of the Greens on other policy differences, but would work constructively on gambling reform.</p> <p>“We support good bills wherever they come from and we applaud the Greens for addressing this important social issue,” Pearse said.</p> <p>“The fact that these exemptions have not been reviewed in 20 years is unacceptable when you think about the social cost. A number of reforms are needed. We also support a cashless gaming card and a complete ban on all gambling advertising.”</p> <p>Pearse said the ACL was also<strong> </strong>willing to work with the Greens in Victoria, which has criticised the state Labor government’s reforms as “insufficient”. She agreed the ACL’s willingness to work with the Greens highlighted a change of strategy.</p> <p>Faehrmann said the ACL’s approach reflected bipartisan concern about the state <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/12/nsw-government-failing-to-measure-or-reduce-gambling-harm-damning-audit-finds">Labor government’s record on poker machines</a>.</p> <p>“The Greens and the Australian Christian Lobby don’t often see eye to eye on things,” Faehrmann said. “In fact, until now we’ve pretty much been polar opposites of any debate.</p> <p>“We can’t afford to play politics on this issue. Poker machines are designed to addict and exploit people and the longer [premier] Chris Minns refuses to act, the more lives will be destroyed. If it takes a so-called unholy alliance to change that, then so be it.”</p> <p>The Greens and the ACL have been bitter political rivals for two decades. Last year, <a href="https://www.acl.org.au/media/tired-greens-continue-to-express-their-hate-for-faith/">the ACL referred to the Greens as a “hardcore Marxist party”</a>. It has also accused the Greens of demonstrating a “hate for faith”, which it denies. Greens politicians have also accused the ACL of <a href="https://greens.org.au/sa/news/media-release/speech-senator-robert-simms-calls-out-tony-abbott-speaking-adf-event-us">spreading homophobia and hate speech</a>, a charge the group denies.</p> <p>The state’s gaming minister, David Harris, has rejected claims the government has not acted on poker machines.</p> <p>On multiple occasions in recent months, Harris has said the government “takes harm minimisation seriously and has implemented a number of initiatives”.</p> <p>These initiatives include reducing the cash limit on new machines from $5,000 to $500, banning external signage at venues, putting more responsible gaming officers in venues, and investing $100m in a gambling harm minimisation fund.</p> <p>But Wesley Mission, which also works with the ACL on calls for gambling reform, argued the government has introduced “limited reforms” that are “clearly not having an impact”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/05/nsw-gamblers-losing-24m-to-poker-machines-every-day-analysis-shows-ntwnfb">NSW gamblers losing $24m to poker machines every day, analysis shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NSW government has not yet responded to the independent panel’s recommendations.</p> <p>The Alliance for Gambling Reform’s chief advocate, Tim Costello, congratulated the Greens and the ACL for setting aside their disputes to campaign on poker machines.</p> <p>“Who would have thought that in such a polarised society, the pain of pokies could have brought such inimical foes on to a unity ticket?” Costello said.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In Australia, <a href="https://www.gamblinghelponline.org.au/">Gambling Help Online</a> is available on 1800 858 858 and the National Debt Helpline is at 1800 007 007.
