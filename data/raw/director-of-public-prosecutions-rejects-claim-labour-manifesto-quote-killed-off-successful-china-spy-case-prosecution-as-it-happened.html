   <li><p><strong>Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, has rejected claims that the inclusion of a line about Labour’s policy towards China, quoting from its manifesto, killed off the prospect of the alleged China spies being prosecuted.</strong> (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/27/asylum-hotel-report-steve-reed-wes-streeting-epping-offender-prison-news-updates-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-68ffad808f089e9cb2a087d5#block-68ffad808f089e9cb2a087d5">5.42pm</a>.) The ‘Labour manifesto quote’ in one of the witness statements has been cited by Tories as evidence to support their claim that the government intervened to collapse the trial. In evidence to a parliamentary committee, Parkinson and other witnesses did not say anything to substantiate these allegations. Instead, they backed the government’s argument that the case collapsed because espionage legislation had not been updated and because it was the previous government’s policy not to call China a national security threat.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">DNSA says he does not think there are 'huge differences' between Tories' China policy and Labour's</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Collins</strong> told the committee that he did not think there were “huge differences” between the Conservative government’s policy towards China and Labour.</p> 
  <p>Asked why he included a line about Labour’s policy in his final witness statement, Collins said he was asked to include that by counter-terrorism police. They wanted current government policy mentioned.</p> 
  <p>He said he was not consciously quoting the Labour manifesto. He had taken the line about the government wanting to cooperate where it could, compete where it needed to and challenging where it had from a parliamentary statement.</p> 
  <p><em>UPDATE:</em> <strong>Collins</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I was asked to include a reference to the new government’s policy by Counter Terrorism Police (CTP), for fear that there would be a wedge driven between my witness statements and the new Government’s policy. I did that.</p> 
   <p>Just as a point of fact, I drew from an answer to a parliamentary question, rather than the Labour party manifesto.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">DNSA suggests he was not aware trial would collapse when he told CPS he would not say China posed national security theat</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Collins</strong> says, when he draw up his first witness statement, he had not discussed that with the CPS. It was discussed with counter-terrorism police, who were investigating, and with his own legal team.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: In your follow-up witness statements, why could you not describe China as a threat to national security?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Collins</strong> says he set out the various ways China did pose a threat.</p> 
  <p>But he says he did not describe China as an overall threat in generic terms.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: Why did you do that? Was that your judgment?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Collins</strong> says he was reflecting government policy at the time. At the time the government did not describe China as a threat in a generic sense. He was describing the way China posed threats that the UK needed to protect itself from. He accepts this is a “very fine distinction”.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: Did anyone tell you to say that China was not a threat?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Collins</strong> says his legal team, and counter-terrorism police, were involved in the first witness statement. And that was shared with the PM.</p> 
  <p>After that, he was told he could not share witnesses statement. So further witnesses statements were just drawn up with his small team, and with counter-terrorism policy.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: When did you find out that the trial might collapse because of the limits of what you were saying in your evidence?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Collins</strong> says the first time he became aware the case might collapse was on 3 September, when he was told this at a meeting with the DPP.</p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/49917/documents/268446/default/">his letter</a>, Parkinson said the key meeting where Collins said that he would not state in court that China was a threat to national security at the relevant time, and that he would accept, if asked, that China was not an enemy, took place on 14 August. This was Collins failing to answer the “million dollar question”, as Little put it. (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/27/asylum-hotel-report-steve-reed-wes-streeting-epping-offender-prison-news-updates-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-68ffa2e28f0869992d333a2e#block-68ffa2e28f0869992d333a2e"> 4.56pm</a>.)</p> 
  <p>But, on the basis of what Collins is saying, he did not realise he was collapsing the case when he said that.</p>

  <p>The chair, <strong>Matt Western</strong>, asks Collins how he feels about the collapse of this case.</p> 
  <p><strong>Collins</strong> replies: “Disappointed.”</p> 
  <p>He says he wanted to see this succeed. He knew a lot of people had put a lot of work into this.</p> 
  <p>But he knew that the Official Secrets Act 1911 would have made things difficult.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: We have heard a lot about Labour’s “cooperate, compete, challenge” mantra. Was that the policy at the time these alleged offences were committed?</em></p> 
  <p>No, says <strong>Collins</strong>. But he says the relevant evidence was about the government’s policy at the time.</p>

  <p><em>Q: In the final witness statement, the DNSA quotes from Labour’s manifesto when describing the government’s China policy. (It said the government’s policy was cooperating where it could, competing where it needed to, and challenging where it had to).</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Mark Sedwill</strong>, the former cabinet secretary and former national security adviser, who now sits in the Lords as a crossbench peer, goes next.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: Why did you just ask for security evidence from the deputy national security adviser (DSNA)?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Parkinson</strong> says the choice was made by those investigating the allegations (counter-terrorism police).</p> 
  <p>He says Matthew Collins, the DSNA, seemed a suitable expert witness.</p> 
  <p>If they had called another witness, that might have undermined the case.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sedwill</strong> says the CPS could have found other witnesses to say China is an national security threat – even if the government chooses not to use that language for its own reasons. Why didn’t you do that?</p> 
  <p><strong>Parkinson</strong> said if other witnesses had been called, that would have undermined Parkinson, who they had to call.</p> 
  <p>He says Collins is there to represent the government’s view. He quoted from the integreted reviews of defence and security. And those referred to China as a challenge.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sedwill</strong> says the integreted reviews were statements of policy, not statements of fact.</p> 
  <p>He says government policy documents are drafted with various objectives in mind.</p> 
  <p>He says China is a national security threat and an economic opportunity. Various governments have tried to reconcile that tension for decades.</p> 
  <p>Sedwill says the CPS should have gone to other sources to get a statement of fact.</p> 
  <p><strong>Little</strong> says it would not have been possible to call a witness to undermine what another of his witnesses was saying.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Judge would have thrown out China spy case before it even went to jury, DPP claims, given lack of key security evidence</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, a barrister and chair of the foreign affairs committee, is asking the questions now.</p> 
  <p>She suggests that the evidence should have persuaded a jury that China was an enemy.</p> 
  <p><strong>Parkinson</strong> says that may have been the case when they charged. But the case law changed as a result of the Roussev case (a Bulgarian/Russian spy trial).</p> 
  <p>He says Roussev meant the CPS had to show that the totality of the threats meant China was a threat to national security.</p> 
  <p>So the CPS asked for more. They asked for a statement from the DNSA.</p> 
  <p>But it turned out this was not just “a sticking point”, but a “critical difference”.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: But the court of appeal said they were not redefining the word enemy, and they were going to apply the word enemy in “a common sense way”. That means leaving it up to the jury, doesn’t it? The Roussev judgment was not imposing a restrictive definition.</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Parkinson</strong> disputes this. The CPS felt it had to act within the ambit of the court of appeal ruling.</p> 
  <p><strong>Thornberry</strong> repeats her point – that the CPS should have put this to a jury.</p> 
  <p><strong>Parkinson</strong> says the CPS’s assessment was that this would never get to a jury.</p> 
  <p>He says their only witness was not willing to say China was an active threat.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Tom Little</strong> KC, first senior Treasury counsel and the barrister instructed to prosecute the case, said he realised they have to drop the case when the deputy national security adviser told them that he was not willing to say in evidence that China posed a risk to national security at the relevant time.</p> 
  <p><strong>Parkinson</strong> said, on the basis of that, the CPS concluded that the judge would not have allowed the case to go before the jury.</p> 
  <p><em>UPDATE:</em> <strong>Little</strong> said the DNSA “was clear to me that he would not say that China posed an active threat to national security at the material time”. He went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That was in answer to what I regard as the million dollar question in the case, and once he had said that the current prosecution for those charges was effectively unsustainable, that’s my carefully reflected position.</p> 
   <p>I didn’t jump to that immediately. I advised on 22 August, having reflected over it. As far as those charges were concerned.</p> 
   <p>There was other discussion then about alternative charges.</p> 
   <p>But I don’t think anyone should misunderstand the effect of what the witness had said, that would have been disclosable, and it brought this case effectively to a crashing halt as far as that was concerned with that witness, who is the deputy national security adviser to the cabinet, it’s very different to the position of giving away a witness who witnesses a criminal incident on the street for reasons that I hope are obvious, but we did give very careful consideration as to whether this was remediable, and I concluded, but more importantly, we concluded, that is the entire prosecution team, that it was not.</p>

  <p>The joint committee on the national security strategy is about to start a hearing on the collapse of the China spy case.</p> 
  <p>The Conservatives have been attacking the govenrment over this for weeks now, at first implying the government deliberately lent on the Crown Prosecution Service to get the prosecution dropped, before settling on the claim that the government sabotaged the prosecution by instead withholding the evidence that the CPS needed.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Reeves suggests that spending cuts, as well as tax rises, could be needed to ensure budget sums add up</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> will reportedly have to find at least £20bn to make her sums add up in the budget next month. Much of the coverage about her budget options has assumed that she will use tax rises to fill the gap. But she has at least once suggested the spending cuts could play a part and, in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9v1r7zeekro">an interview with the BBC </a>today, she has again suggested that spending cuts could be part of the mix. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are looking, of course, at tax and spending to ensure that we both have resilience against future shocks by ensuring we’ve got sufficient headroom, and also just ensuring that those fiscal rules are adhered to.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Farage’s suggestion calling for the grooming gangs inquiry to be scrapped and replaced by a parliamentary inquiry is certainly an interesting idea, but one that would only work if there was political consensus and that looks doubtful at the moment.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Though the snap verdict is one of Welsh voters rejecting Reform, the underlying figures suggests this is another strong result for the rising force of the right. Farage’s various parties of the radical right - Ukip, the Brexit party and Reform - have stood nine times in Welsh byelections since Ukip first appeared on the ballot in the contest to replace Neil Kinnock in Islwyn in 1995. The best previous vote share is Ukip’s 15.4% in Ogmore in 2016, while the biggest rise was UKIP’s 14.3 point rise from a standing start in Ynys Mon in 2013. Reforms’s 36% vote share and 34 point rise in Caerphilly smash both these records. Reform also registered a major advance on the 20% the party won in the equivalent Westminster seat last July, and their 16 point gain last week is roughly in line with their rise in GB-wide opinion polls.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer condemns Farage for failing to take action over Sarah Pochin's 'racism'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> has also said that the Reform UK MP Sarah Pochin was being “racist” when she said “it drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people”.</p> 
  <p>In an interview with the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg yesterday, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, repeatedly refused to describe Pochin’s comments as racist – although he did do so in an interview later in the day.</p> 
  <p>Asked if Pochin was being racist in what she said, Starmer told broadcasters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Yes, she was.</p> 
   <p>It’s shocking racism and it’s the sort of thing that will tear our country apart, and it tells you everything about Reform.</p> 
   <p>Nigel Farage has got some questions to answer, because either he doesn’t consider it racist, which in my view is shocking in itself, or he does think it’s racist and he’s shown absolutely no leadership.</p> 
   <p>I’m the prime minister of the whole of our country, our reasonable, tolerant, diverse country, and I want to serve the whole country.</p> 
   <p>He can’t even call out racism.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked whether she should have the whip removed, he said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>[Farage] needs to take action, it’s not a question of just the whip, this is shocking racism, it has to be dealt with and it should be rooted out of his party.</p> 
   <p>And the question for Nigel Farage is, why has he shown absolutely no leadership on this?</p>

   <p>We’re processing the claims much more quickly. And where people have got no right to be in our country, we’re removing them at a higher rate than the best part of a decade.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Two suspended <em>Reform</em> <em>UK</em> councillors have now been expelled from the party via email, PA Media reports. PA says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Kent county councillors Bill Barrett and Robert Ford have been kicked out by email from <em>Reform</em> HQ which said they had “undermined” the interests of the party and brought it into “disrepute”.</p> 
   <p>Their removal comes after a leaked video of a <em>Reform</em> meeting saw council leader Linden Kemkaran telling members to “fucking suck it up” when they disagreed on big decisions.</p> 
   <p>With a budget of more than £2.5bn, Kemkaran also called the council a “shop window” for what <em>Reform</em> could do if it ran the country.</p> 
   <p>Barrett, representing Ashford, had been critical of the council hierarchy and was one of four councillors suspended following the leaked video.</p> 
   <p>Ford, for Maidstone Rural West, was suspended after allegations of misconduct from an “unofficial complaint” from several female members of Kent county council (KCC) staff.</p> 
   <p>A <em><strong>Reform</strong></em><strong> spokesperson</strong> said: “Councillors Barrett and Ford have been expelled as their conduct undermined the interests of the party and brought <em>Reform</em> <em>UK</em> into disrepute.”</p> 
   <p>There have also been allegations of bullying from both members, which <em>Reform</em> has denied.</p> 
   <p>It said: “The party takes claims of bullying seriously.</p> 
   <p>“If there was any credible evidence of this we would not have hesitated to take action.”</p> 
   <p>Opposition KCC leader, Liberal Democrat <strong>Antony Hook</strong>, said that <em>Reform</em> were offering “chaos” and “secrecy” to the public in Kent.</p> 
   <p>He said: “<em>Reform’s</em> chaos at KCC continues, we know that Ford has been suspended after reported complaints by female staff, which is very serious.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Downing Street has described <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/26/epping-sex-offender-back-in-custody-after-being-released-from-prison-in-error">the accidental release</a> of the Epping sex offender, Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, as evidence that the last government left the prison system in crisis.</p> 
  <p>At the No 10 lobby briefing, the <strong>PM’s spokesperson</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Prison release errors are never acceptable, and this is another symptom of the justice system crisis inherited by this government, having suffered cuts to staffing, the failure to build prison places and chronic underinvestment, meaning more errors like this happened.</p> 
   <p>Mistakes are always more likely to happen when you’re in prison crisis that demands early releases.</p> 
   <p>But that’s why we’re fixing the system, building 14,000 more prison places and overhauling sentences so we never again have a system that demands emergency releases.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The spokesperson said there were 800 mistaken prison releases under the last government. That was “symptomatic of a justice system creaking at the seams”, he said.</p> 
  <p>He said David Lammy, the justice secretary, would be setting out in his Commons statement later today what methods are being put in place to deal with this.</p> 
  <p>When it was put to him that there 262 prisoners were released in error in the year to March 2025, a 128% increase on 115 in the previous 12 months, the spokesperson said those figures were evidence of “the scale of the justice system crisis that this government has been confronted with”.</p> 
  <p>The spokesperson also said Kebatu, who is Ethiopian, would be deported “imminently”.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, is holding a press conference at 2pm. In an open letter to him released this morning, <strong>Anna Turley</strong>, the Labour chair, has challenged him to remove the whip from the Reform MP <strong>Sarah Pochin</strong> after she said “it drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people”.</p> 
  <p>In her letter, <strong>Turley</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>At the time of writing you have made no public comment about Sarah Pochin’s remarks, which is uncharacteristically reticent of you. I am writing to you to urgently clarity Reform’s official position:</p> 
   <p> -Do you endorse Sarah Pochin’s comments? And can you confirm if her views on race are welcome in Reform UK?</p> 
   <p>-Will you withdraw the Reform UK whip from Sarah Pochin?</p> 
   <p> Sarah Pochin’s comments were a disgrace. And your silence is deafening.<br><br>Saying that seeing black and Asian people in TV adverts “drives me mad” is racist. You have the power to withdraw the Reform UK whip from Sarah Pochin. You should do it today.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In his First Edition briefing today, <strong>Archie Bland</strong> cites Pochin’s comment as just one of many examples of how racist language that once would have been restricted to extremists like the BNP is becoming increasingly normalised.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Labour's decision to cut time refugees get to find alternative housing 'extremely disappointing', committee says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>But the <strong>Commons home affairs committee</strong>’s <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/49900/documents/268016/default/">report </a>is also critical of some aspects of what the Home Office has been doing on asylum hotels since Labour took power. Here are some of the points it makes about Labour’s record on this issue.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The committee expresses concerns about the government’s plan to move asylum seekers out of hotels and place them in “large sites” instead, such as former military bases.</strong> (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/27/asylum-hotel-report-steve-reed-wes-streeting-epping-offender-prison-news-updates-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-68ff25898f0837a8ea394310#block-68ff25898f0837a8ea394310"> 9.23am</a>.) It says:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The [Home Office] is considering the use of large sites in its approach to asylum accommodation, having previously said it would move away from their use. In principle, large sites can provide suitable temporary accommodation. However, they have generally proved more costly to deliver than hotel accommodation and will not enable the department to drive down costs in the same way as expanding dispersal accommodation. If the department chooses to pursue large sites, it needs to fully understand and accept this trade off. It must learn the lessons from its previous mistakes in rushing to deliver short-term solutions that later unravel.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>It says the government has still not set out a “clear strategy” for asylum accommodation.</strong> </p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The government has committed to reducing the cost of the asylum system and ending the use of hotels by 2029. This is a stated Government priority, but making promises to appeal to popular sentiment without setting out a clear and fully articulated plan for securing alternative accommodation risks under-delivery and consequently undermining public trust still further. The Home Office has failed to share a clear strategy for the long-term delivery of asylum accommodation.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>It says the number of asylum seekers in hotels went up during Labour’s first 12 months in office.</strong> It says:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The number of asylum seekers in hotels is currently significantly lower than during the peak of hotel use—32,059 people as of June 2025, compared to 56,042 in September 2023—although the number of asylum seekers accommodated in hotels was 8% higher in June 2025 compared to June 2024.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>It says it is “extremely disappointing” that the Home Office abandoned a pilot programme giving refugees 56 days to find alternative accommodation if they have to leave Home Office housing (like a hotel) because their asylum application has been accepted. </strong>The Home Office has reverted to 28 days’ notice, even though the 56 days’s notice system was said to reduce the number or refugees finding themselves homeless. It says:</p></li> 
  </ul>

 <h2 class="block-title">What Commons home affairs committee said about Home Office's 'chaotic' asylum hotels policy under Tories</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Commons home affairs committee</strong> has a Labour majority (like all Commons select committees) but it is chaired by a former Tory culture secretary, Karen Bradley. Party loyalty has not stopped her producing <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/49900/documents/268016/default/">a report</a> that is quite damning about the record of the last government.</p> 
  <p>Here are extracts from the report’s summary commenting on the Conservatives’ record.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Over the past six years, the Home Office has presided over an increasingly expensive asylum accommodation system. The expected cost of the Home Office’s asylum accommodation contracts for the ten years between 2019–29 has more than tripled, from £4.5bn to £15.3bn. External factors – the Covid-19 pandemic and the dramatic increase in small boat arrivals – and decisions by the previous government – such as pausing asylum decision-making while it pursued the Rwanda scheme – have meant that the Home Office has had to accommodate a growing number of people for longer periods of time. At the end of 2018 around 47,500 asylum seekers were accommodated by the Home Office. As of June 2025, the Home Office was responsible for accommodating around 103,000 people …</p> 
   <p>We heard powerful evidence that during the 2019–2024 parliament the Home Office focused on pursuing high-risk, poorly planned policy solutions. Failures of leadership at a senior level, shifting priorities, and political and operational pressure for quick results meant that the department was incapable of getting a grip on the situation, and allowed costs to spiral.</p> 
   <p>The Home Office has become heavily reliant on the costly use of hotels for asylum accommodation – which are unpopular with local communities and largely unsuitable for accommodating asylum seekers. It has used large scale contracts with private providers to deliver asylum accommodation, but these contracts have provided few levers to control costs and ensure that providers are delivering the accommodation required. The Home Office seems to have neglected the day-to-day management of these contracts, failing to protect value for money for the taxpayer. Two accommodation providers owe millions to the Home Office in excess profits, but the Home Office only appears to have started the process for recouping these profits in 2024 and has yet to reclaim these profits from providers. This money should be supporting the delivery of public services, not sitting in the bank accounts of private businesses.</p> 
   <p>The Home Office has undoubtedly been operating in an extremely challenging environment, but its chaotic response has demonstrated that it has not been up to the challenge.</p>

They can act now to relieve pressure on hotels by making better quality and faster asylum decisions, including swiftly granting status to people from countries where they are almost always recognised as refugees like Syria and Sudan. </p>

  <p>The average person saw “no meaningful improvement in their life” over Labour’s first year in power, a survey of thousands of Britons has suggested. In its report on the findings of <a href="https://carnegieuk.org/publication/life-in-the-uk-2025/">a survey</a> by <strong>Carnegie UK</strong>, a wellbeing charity, PA Media says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>An annual “Life in the UK” survey of 7,000 people carried out by charity <em>Carnegie</em> UK found stagnating wellbeing and persistent economic hardship for millions since 2023.</p> 
   <p>Sarah Davidson, the charity’s chief executive, said the survey “shows that between May 2024 and May 2025, the average person in the UK saw no meaningful improvement in their life”.</p> 
   <p>She added: “Public services and systems are barely working for too many households, and our research shows that poorer people, larger families and people in social housing are still getting left behind.”</p> 
   <p>Davidson acknowledged that there were “some emerging signs of hope”, with people finding it more affordable to heat their homes and “slight improvements” in mental and physical health.</p> 
   <p>But she warned that these improvements were not evenly distributed, with older, wealthier homeowners reporting much higher wellbeing than younger, poorer people in less secure housing.</p> 
   <p>She said: “Underlying all these results is the inescapable fact that significant and damaging inequalities persist across all parts of the UK.”</p> 
   <p>The Life in the UK survey asked a range of questions on economic, social, environmental and democratic topics to come up with an overall “wellbeing score” out of 100.</p> 
   <p>This year’s survey reported an overall wellbeing score of 62, one point higher than last year and the same score as 2023.</p>

  <p>These findings help to corroborate (at least a bit) what Wes Streeting was going on about yesterday.

 <h2 class="block-title">Green party calls for Home Office to be broken up, saying seperate department should handle migration</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Green party has called for the Home Office to be broken up in the light of today’s report about asylum hotels. It has put out this statement from <strong>Rachel Millward</strong>, the party’s co-deputy leader.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>‘Failed, chaotic and expensive’ – these are the words used by today’s report to describe the government’s asylum accommodation system, but they apply just as fittingly to the Home Office as a whole which has spent decades wasting taxpayer money in a destructive pursuit of the most hostile migration system possible. </p> 
   <p>This is just one in a litany of reports which lays bare the Home Office’s dysfunction – in this case, allowing private companies to make obscene profits while vulnerable people are put at risk and community tensions are ratcheted up to breaking point. </p> 
   <p>If we are to have a functional and fair migration system, the Home Office must be broken up so that migration can be dealt with by a department designed to make the system work, not simply project a hardline stance to the public no matter the cost to the taxpayer or the impact on migrants.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Governors warned it would add to the workloads of already-overstretched staff and questioned whether it would solve a problem that has yet to be identified by any investigation. The new checks could take as long as 45 minutes per prisoner, one source said.</p> 
   <p>One senior governor said: “I understand the government is very eager to prevent this from happening again, but there’s an investigation which has only just been commissioned.</p> 
   <p>“Until that’s under way, the <a href="https://archive.is/o/vQs5Q/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/prisons/">prison service</a> won’t know what went wrong or whether the proposed checks are what are needed to prevent it happening again.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Minister says government committed to getting all asylum seekers out of hotels after report says system 'chaotic'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning. When Jimmy Carter was US president, he gave<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/carter-crisis/"> a famous address</a> in 1979 saying the country was suffering a crisis of confidence. It became known as the malaise speech, and now it is widely regarded as a mistake, because it was unduly pessimistic and because, in the presidential election the following year, voters turned to the much more upbeat Ronald Reagaan.</p> 
  <p>Yesterday <strong>Wes Streeting</strong>, the health secretary, had his own Jimmy Carter moment on Sky News, saying Britons are in despair. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I am battling cultural challenges in the NHS too, whether that’s people abdicating responsibility, not listening to patients, covering things up when things go wrong.</p> 
   <p>And all of those things undermine public trust and confidence, not just in the NHS, but in the ability of government, by which I mean any government, to be able to effect change.</p> 
   <p>And there is a deep disillusionment in this country at the moment, and I would say a growing sense of despair, about whether anyone is capable of turning this country around.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Streeting also said that he was an optimist, and that he could see “green shoots of recovery”, but it is the “growing sense of despair” line that has stuck.</p> 
  <p>And today Westminster is full of news that goes some way to reinforcing Streeting’s point. This morning the media are debating a report saying asylum hotels have been a disaster, and this afternoon there will be a statement in the Commons about a farcical prisoner release. We’ve also got a press conference from Reform UK (a party that thrives by fomenting despair), and then towards the end of the day a select commitee about a botched spy prosecution that also implies the British state has a default failure setting.</p> 
  <p>Here is <strong>Diane Taylor</strong>’s story about the report on asylum hotels.</p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> 
   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/27/home-office-squandered-billions-on-failed-and-chaotic-asylum-accommodation">Home Office squandered billions on ‘failed and chaotic’ asylum accommodation</a> </p> 
  </aside> 
  <p>And here is the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/49900/documents/268016/default/">full report</a> from the home affairs select committee.</p> 
  <p><strong>Steve Reed</strong>, the housing secretary, was defending the government on the airwaves this morning. He pointed out that the contracts criticised by the committee were signed by the last government. And he insisted that the government would get all asylum seekers out of hotels, by using purpose-built accommodation on sites like ex military bases instead. He told the Today programme the tovernment was looking at “modular” forms of building to ensure sites could go up quickly.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>You can use modular forms of building. That means it can go up much faster than would normally be the case, and there are planning processes that we can use in these circumstances to make sure that the planning system itself isn’t delayed.</p> 
   <p>I’m expecting announcements to come on that within weeks, so we just have to wait and see.</p> 
   <p>It would be foolish to come on your show and announce things where the detail hasn’t been fully worked out, because you’d pick holes in it, quite rightly so.</p> 
   <p>So we want to get it right, but the intention is to get those former military bases is one example of it, where we could use big sites and get people on there and end the use of hotels entirely. That’s where we want to get to.</p>
