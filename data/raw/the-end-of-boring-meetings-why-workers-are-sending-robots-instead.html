<p><strong>Name:</strong> Meeting bots.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Relatively new.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Soulless drones attending your monthly planning meeting.</p> <p><strong>That sounds like everyone who attends our monthly </strong><strong>meetings. </strong>Exactly – they fit in so well that often nobody notices.</p> <p><strong>Notices what? </strong>That they are not people, they are AI-powered entities.</p> <p><strong>You mean robot spies? </strong>It’s more of a virtual workspace tool – a bot assistant that accompanies you to your online meeting.</p> <p><strong>What’s the point of that? </strong>The bot takes notes so you don’t have to, and if you are late to the meeting it will catch you up on the discussion so far.</p> <p><strong>That sounds creepy, but sort of handy. </strong>You can also expect a critique of your behaviour afterwards.</p> <p><strong>From whom? </strong>From the bot. The latest AI post-meeting reports offer tips on improving your speaking style and will gently reprimand you for going on too long or interrupting too much.</p> <p><strong>If the bot thinks it knows so much about meetings, it can go </strong><strong>on its own. </strong>They often do. Increasingly, managers are skipping meetings and relying on the bots for a summary of who was there and what was said, including a run-down of the gossip.</p> <p><strong>In the future only </strong><strong>bots will go to meetings. </strong>The future is here. Marketing director Colin Dougherty recently found himself the sole human in a virtual meeting, the only others present being robot notetakers. “It was like, super-dystopian,” he told the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p><strong>It sounds </strong><strong>perfect to me</strong><strong>, Colin’s only mistake was turning up. </strong>He might never have known. Bots are usually labelled as “so-and-so’s notetaker”, but their senders sometimes blur the lines by giving them humanoid profiles.</p> <p><strong>How do you recognise a bot in a meeting – any tips? </strong>They tend to turn up on time.</p> <p><strong>What a giveaway. Still, I’d be sort of relieved to find out some manager was actually a faceless robot with no feelings. </strong>That is perhaps the thinking behind Ms Bailey.</p> <p><strong>Who is Ms Bailey? </strong>She’s the new principal headteacher at Cottesmore school in West Sussex.</p> <p><strong>And she’s a fan of AI? </strong>Abigail Bailey <em>is</em> AI – an algorithmic tool designed to offer advice to students.</p> <p><strong>How very forward-thinking. </strong>Cottesmore was the first school in the country to hire its own head of AI.</p> <p><strong>Oh yeah? Who did they get? </strong>Jamie Rainer.</p> <p><strong>Never heard of him. Is he some sort of industry expert with a background in digital … Oh wait, he’s a robot too, isn’t he? </strong>You guessed it.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Don’t mind me, I’m just here to listen. And remember.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “So if there are no humans present, now might be a good time to have that chat about taking over the planet.”</p>
