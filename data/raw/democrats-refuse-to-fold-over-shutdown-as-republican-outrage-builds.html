<p>When he sat down to talk about the US government shutdown with reporters from a closely read political newsletter this week, Chuck Schumer sounded as if he were relishing his standoff with the Republicans.</p> <p>“Every day gets better for us,” he told Punchbowl News. As the shutdown got under way, Schumer explained, the Republicans believed that Democrats would quickly fold and vote to reopen the government, but instead they had stuck to their guns for a week and a half, demanding an array of concessions on healthcare and other issues.</p> <p>Outrage followed from Republicans, who printed out the Senate minority leader’s remark on posters and condemned it before press conferences. The shutdown has prompted federal agencies to close or curtail operations nationwide, and forced hundreds of thousands of employees to stay home without immediate pay. Schumer, Republicans argued, was being callous.</p> <p>“I’ve been asked many times in interviews the last couple days: ‘You seem angry – you don’t get angry a lot.’ I don’t, but this is beyond the pale,” the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, said at a press conference on Friday morning, the 10th day of the shutdown. “What Chuck Schumer is doing right now, it’s sickening.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/federal-workers-pay-government-shutdown">White House announces federal worker layoffs as shutdown nears third week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hours later, the White House took it upon itself to increase the misery for government employees when Russ Vought, the director of the office of management and budget, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/federal-workers-pay-government-shutdown">began following</a> through on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/trump-administration-government-shutdown">his threat</a> to carry out layoffs. The budget office said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/federal-workers-pay-government-shutdown">more than</a> 4,000 federal workers were being fired from a variety of agencies that had already shrunk in the second Trump administration, and the funding situation was “fluid and rapidly evolving”. Legal challenges are likely to follow, but still, now it was the Democrats’ turn to accuse the GOP of brutality.</p> <p>“Let’s be blunt: nobody’s forcing Trump and Vought to do this,” Schumer said in a statement. “They don’t have to do it; they want to. They’re callously choosing to hurt people – the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.”</p> <p>It was the latest salvo in a battle that began when government funding lapsed on 1 October and has since degenerated into legislative trench warfare. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/09/senate-deadlock-government-shutdown">Seven Senate votes</a> have resulted in no breakthroughs, with lawmakers from both parties preventing the other’s proposals from reaching the 60-vote threshold needed to advance.</p> <p>Democrats are maximizing the leverage they have in the upper chamber by refusing to reopen the government until <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/30/government-shutdown-healthcare-medicaid">premium tax credits</a> for Affordable Care Act health plans are extended into next year. They also want cuts to the Medicaid program for poor and disabled Americans reversed, funding to public media outlets such as PBS and NPR restored and Donald Trump’s use of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-pocket-rescission-foreign-aid-funding">pocket rescissions</a>” to slash spending curbed.</p> <p>Most of those are non-starters for Republicans, who insist government funding be restarted before negotiations take place. They’ve ascribed a variety of motivations to Democrats’ intransigence, from the rise of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/07/we-have-the-people-bernie-sanders-campaigns-with-zohran-mamdani-as-new-york-mayoral-race-enters-final-stretch">Zohran Mamdani</a> as the Democratic nominee for New York mayor to the influence of a “far-left base” that has the party’s leaders in their thrall.</p> <p>On Friday, Johnson posited that Democratic senators were holding out because they were concerned about a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/no-kings-protests-trump-military-parade">“No Kings” protest</a> planned for 18 October – which he called a “hate America rally” and where attendees might target party leaders if they decided to end the shutdown.</p> <p>“It is an outrageous gathering for outrageous purposes, but the Democrats in the Senate have shown that they’re afraid of that crowd,” Johnson said, alleging that “the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/what-is-antifa-meaning-trump">antifa</a> crowd, and the pro-Hamas crowd and the Marxists” would be in attendance.</p> <p>“They’re willing to hold the American people hostage so that they don’t have to face an angry mob – that’s a big chunk of their base,” he said.</p> <p>There are indeed outside influences pressuring Democrats to stand firm on their demands, and so far they are happy with the results.</p> <p>“The Democrats, I think, have taken in the blowback, have understood where their folks want them to go, and are actually taking it and fighting back. And it’s a sight to see. It’s a welcome strategic shift,” Ezra Levin, co-executive director of progressive organizing group Indivisible, said.</p> <p>In March, Schumer opted to work with Republicans on keeping the government open, prompting Indivisible to call for him to step aside as minority leader. Months later, Levin says his group is coordinating with Schumer’s office on actions to support Democratic lawmakers as the shutdown wears on, and believes the party should not compromise on its demands.</p> <p>Not only are Democrats’ demands “wildly popular”, Republicans are not to be trusted to honor any agreement, he said. Trump and his allies in Congress have made clear their interest in rescissions packages, which can be passed on a party-line vote, to cut spending approved with bipartisan support. After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/17/house-republicans-rescissions">passing one</a> in July that clawed back $9bn in funding for public media and foreign aid, Johnson said he is considering putting together another.</p> <p>“This regime is treating the federal budget like a personal bank account for Donald Trump, and we should stop that,” Levin said. “No deal is a real deal unless you have rescission and payment language.</p> <p>“We’ve got the goods. We are fighting for popular things. The Republicans are closing rural hospitals, increasing costs and giving a lawless administration more power to do what it wants. That’s a losing hand, and we want to see Democrats fight back.”</p>
