<h1>The ghost of Ronald Reagan has spooked Trump over tariffs</h1>

<p>Halloween came early for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>. Ronald Reagan spooked him. Trump had a startled reaction to the TV ad that appeared during the first game of the World Series, placed by the provincial government of Ontario, featuring excerpts from President Reagan’s radio talk in April 1987 in which he explained the danger of trade wars. “Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/25/g-s1-95116/trump-canada-anti-tariffs-ad-import-tax">Trump posted</a>. It was, he falsely claimed, a “serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act”. In retaliation, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan">he slapped an additional 10% tariff</a> on Canada.</p> <p>Trump was apparently horrified at the sudden presence of the ghost of conservatism past, who had kept the outlandish bounder at arm’s length and whom Trump regarded warily if not nervously. Reagan was the original, bigger and more successful performer, whose appeal was as the harbinger of morning in America, not the grim reaper of a zombie nightfall. Canada is being punished for Trump’s fright.</p> <p>Trump seemingly fears Reagan’s image might be taken as a warning to the supreme court to rule against him in the impending case of Trump v VOS, in which the basis of his tariff regime is at stake. “Canada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115428874684902595">Trump claimed</a>.</p> <p>Two courts have already ruled against Trump for his invocation of national security under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on whomever he wishes without the approval of the Congress. In late May, the US court of international trade held that most of Trump’s tariffs were “contrary to law”. He appealed to the US court of appeals for the federal circuit, which on 29 August <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trumps-global-tariffs-unlawful-appeals-court/story?id=125110624">affirmed the CIT ruling</a>. The appeals court observed that “tariffs are a core Congressional power”. The IEEPA does not explicitly grant the president the authority to impose tariffs. Even if the IEEPA were interpreted to allow tariffs, it would represent an unconstitutional delegation of Congress’s power to the president.</p> <p>Twice rebuffed, Trump has appealed to the supreme court. The argument is scheduled for 5 November. Trump’s hair-trigger response to the sudden appearance of Reagan’s shade revealed his deep unease with how the court might rule. Even though the court has permitted many of his policies to proceed temporarily without legal justification through the “shadow docket”, he seems to know he might be on shaky ground here. In the tariff case, the amicus briefs against Trump were filed by some of the leading lights of the conservative legal world. Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/federal-court-trump-power-impose-tariffs-unilaterally/story?id=122290881">accused the appeals court judges</a> of “hatred” and called Leonard Leo, the co-chair of the Federalist Society, which provided Trump with the lists of nominees for judgeships, a “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/29/trump-goes-after-leonard-leo-and-the-federalist-society-in-fury-over-court-ruling-00375813">sleazebag</a>”. Trump is clearly afraid.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>Everything is a zero-sum game for Trump, not just international trade</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 15 October Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/trump-supreme-court-tariffs-trade.html">announced that he might attend the oral arguments</a> in person, to become the first sitting president ever to witness a supreme court case. Trump apparently has no concern about tainting the perception of the court’s objectivity or legitimacy. Either the court works for him or it does not; the justices fall in line or they are among the enemies within. To Trump, the Republican court should be no different from the Department of Justice under his thumb. He evidently views the separation of powers as a personal affront, unfairly stealing from him. Everything is a zero-sum game, not just international trade. “I’m the speaker and the president,” Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/us/politics/mike-johnson-speaker-congress.html">has joked</a>, according to the New York Times.</p> <p>Trump’s appearance in the sanctum of the court would let them know who’s the real chief. Just as the <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/dems-warn-emil-bove-hearing-shows-blurring-line-between-trump-and-courts/">attorney general, Pam Bondi, and her deputy, Todd Blanche, sat behind</a> Emil Bove, Trump’s henchman and nominee for the federal appeals bench, as Bove faced the senators at his confirmation hearing, Trump could sit behind his solicitor general, D John Sauer, to glower at the black-robed justices. His presence would threaten to strip away the veneer of the court’s independence as well as show his distrust for his own lawyer’s ability to prevail on the merits. Whether he wins or loses the case, he has personalized it. Winning would be interpreted as a victory for intimidation; losing would be flouting him rather than ruling on the merits. Either way, he would be poison and the decision would be, as it is said in the law, the fruit of the poisonous tree.</p> <p>Trump has been losing his case so far because of his transparently weak and sham argument, part economic illiteracy and part glaring cynicism, though there is a blurred line with Trump. Granting Trump his boneheaded economics, assuming he’s just a crude real estate operator who does not know the most basic things about international trade, may lend his primitivism a patina of dumb clumsy earnestness. Contrary to Trump’s stubborn ignorance, however, trade deficits are not a mercantilist zero-sum game and tariffs are not a tax on foreign countries. His complementary point that he must be able to impose universal tariffs by fiat whenever he likes without congressional authority, the <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/how-unprecedented-are-trumps-emergency-tariffs">only president ever</a> to grab power for himself unilaterally under the statute in its 50-year history, because of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/">non sequitur of fentanyl trafficking</a>, is so ridiculously phoney that it colors his whole case as typically dishonest.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/24/donald-trump-has-built-a-regime-of-retribution-and-reward">Donald Trump has built a regime of retribution and reward | Sidney Blumenthal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump’s snap imposition of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-brazilian-products-tariffs-bolsonaro-rcna222534">50% tariffs on Brazil</a> for its supreme court’s judgment convicting his ally the former president Jair Bolsonaro of an attempted coup and Trump’s additional 10% tariff on Canada in his fit of pique at the Reagan TV ad may only serve to undermine his already tenuous argument that he is compelled to usurp sole power based on the IEEPA in the interest of national security. His tantrums are gifts to the opposing attorney, who may well hold them up as obvious refutations of his claims.</p> <p>In advance of Trump’s date with the court, he has raced around Asia tossing concessions which he hails as victories. Dropping the tariff rates for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-asia-tour-tokyo-japanese-prime-minister-meeting-sanae-takaichi/">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly4jz9zr50o">South Korea</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-china-deal-means-rare-earths-soybean-farmers/story?id=127028309">China</a>, while Beijing lifted its retaliatory threats to withhold rare earth minerals and stop purchasing American soybeans, he has to that extent reduced the harm he alone has been responsible for inflicting.</p> <p>The previously perfectly submissive Republican Congress has begun to crack up in reaction to the stress that Trump’s policies have placed on the rural Republican base. In symbolic votes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/politics/senate-vote-trump-brazil-tariffs.html">five GOP senators</a> joined Democrats to oppose Trump’s tariffs on Brazil and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5580167-senate-vote-trump-canada-tariffs/">four voted against</a> his tariffs on Canada. The <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/gop-lawmakers-push-back-trump-admin-plan-import-argentinian-beef">Republicans are in an uproar</a>, following American ranchers, over his <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/argentina-milei-trump-bailout-economy-rcna240781">approval of importation of more Argentinian beef</a>, apparently as a favor to his rightwing ally Javier Milei, to whom he has also authorized the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-trump-is-giving-argentina-a-20-billion-lifeline-to-help-its-flailing-economy">payment of $20bn</a> in support of the waning Argentinian currency. While Trump has grudgingly acknowledged that he cannot run for a third term, the Republican members of the Congress still have to face the music.</p> <p>The illegality of his tariffs aside, Trump’s retreat reveals the lasting damage he has already done to the US economy, his enhancement of Chinese power and his alienation of our allies, and it exposes his performance as a pantomime strongman on the world stage. Though some of his tariffs will be reduced, even those that remain stand at an unprecedented level in living memory.</p> <p>“Consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate of 17.9%, the highest since 1934,” the <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-26-2025">Yale Budget Lab</a> reports. For small businesses, which account for one-third of US trade, <a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/b4559992/files/uploaded/Economic_Whiplash_Stirs_Small_Business_Alarm.pdf">78% expect higher costs</a>, and, unable to absorb them, 71% anticipate needing to pass them on as price increases. The Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oecd-us-economic-forecast-trump-tariffs-2025-2026/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20administration's%20policies%2C%20which,and%20large%20financial%20market%20corrections.%22">projects</a> that as a result of Trump’s tariffs the US Gross Domestic Product growth rate will fall from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.5% in 2026 – a decline of nearly half.</p> <p>Trump’s atavistic return to the Republican protectionism of the 1930s, which deepened the Great Depression, rejects the lessons that Ronald Reagan sought to teach. “The memory of all this occurring back in the 30s made me determined when I came to Washington to spare the American people the protectionist legislation that destroys prosperity,” Reagan, the former New Dealer, said in the speech that enraged Trump enough to punish Canada for reviving it.</p> <p>Reagan’s <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-free-and-fair-trade-6">talk</a> was a prophetic warning of the peril of Trump’s tariffs: “You see, at first, when someone says, ‘Let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports,’ it looks like they’re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes for a short while it works – but only for a short time … High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars … Then the worst happens: markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs.”</p> <p>Trump’s relationship with Reagan was always uneasy. Throughout the 1980s, he sought Reagan’s imprimatur. In 1983, Reagan was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2016/06/22/daily-202-reagan-white-house-viewed-trump-and-his-large-ego-warily/5769f9e3981b92a22d278fa5/">asked</a> to send a congratulatory telegram on the opening of Trump Tower. A few years later, Trump invited the president to attend a LaToya Jackson concert at his Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino at Atlantic City. Several attempts to edge close to Reagan were rejected, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2016/06/22/daily-202-reagan-white-house-viewed-trump-and-his-large-ego-warily/5769f9e3981b92a22d278fa5/">Washington Post</a>. The White House counsel’s office wrote “NO” on the telegram request. Offering advice on calling Trump, Reagan’s political director advised, “He has a large ego” – “large” was underlined.</p> <p>Nancy and Ronald Reagan lavished attention on the wealthy, but Trump was apparently too vulgar. It seems not even Trump’s lawyer, Roy Cohn, who was close to Nancy Reagan, could gain him access. Finally, Trump got himself invited to a social event at the White House, stood in the photo line and took a standard picture shaking hands with the president, and received the signed picture. Unfortunately, it was signed from “Reagan Reagan”. A corrected photo was sent, but Trump featured the original image as a token of his significance in The Art of the Deal.</p> <p>In that book, published in 1987, Trump suggested that Reagan was a hollow construct, “so smooth, so effective a performer” that “only now, seven years later, are people beginning to question whether there’s anything beneath that smile”. That year Trump briefly considered his first run for the presidency. He made a foray into New Hampshire and <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-yes-trump-paid-030000826.html">bought full-page ads in the New York Times, Washington Post and Boston Globe</a> scathingly attacking Reagan for weakness. His “Open Letter” stated, “There’s nothing wrong with America’s Foreign Defense Policy that a little backbone can’t cure.” He blamed the federal deficit on our alliances. “Make Japan, Saudi Arabia, and others pay for the protection we extend to allies,” he wrote. “Let’s not let our great country be laughed at anymore.” It was the complaint he would retail for decades regardless of the circumstances. At the bottom, the ads reproduced his squiggly signature, nearly identical to the one on the lewd birthday card to Jeffrey Epstein that he denies he ever wrote. Now, “Reagan Reagan” has returned to haunt him.</p> <p>There’s a twist characteristic of the Trump era. If Trump loses his tariff case, the duties collected from companies will have to be refunded. The Wall Street financial firm of Cantor Fitzgerald reportedly <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cantor-fitzgerald-trump-tariff-refunds/">anticipates a market</a> on the rights to the tariff refunds. Its former head Howard Lutnick is the secretary of commerce, and his sons now run the firm. A Cantor Fitzgerald subsidiary is offering 20% to 30% in cash upfront rather than wait for litigation to resolve the claims, according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cantor-fitzgerald-trump-tariff-refunds/">Wired</a> magazine. In exchange, the company would eventually get the full refund. But if Trump prevails, the claims would be worthless. A spokesperson for Cantor Fitzgerald calls the report “absolutely false”, saying in a statement that it is “not in the business of positioning any risk, taking views or facilitating business in litigation claims involving the legality of US tariffs”.</p> <p>In August, however, the senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren sent a <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/8132025_letter_from_ranking_member_wyden_and_ranking_member_warren_to_cantor_fitzgerald_llppdf.pdf">letter</a> on 13 August to Brandon Lutnick, Cantor Fitzgerald’s CEO, seeking information. “Given that one of the purported architects of President Trump’s tariff policy is Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, your father and the former Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, LP, the firm’s actions raise obvious conflict-of-interest and insider dealing concerns.”</p> <p>The senators inquired: “Has anyone at Cantor or Cantor Fitzgerald, LP communicated with any individual representing the Administration’s interest or working on the court cases on these matters? If so, please provide a list of all such conversations, including the date, the individuals involved, and the nature of the conversation.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the commerce department stated in an email to Wired, “Secretary Lutnick knows nothing about this decision because he has no insight or strategic control over Cantor Fitzgerald.” He remains busy working on Trump’s tariffs.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 4 November 2025 to add a response from Cantor Fitzgerald to the Wired report.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Self-Made-Man-Political-Abraham-Lincoln/dp/1476777268/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=A+Self-Made+Man&amp;qid=1597952377&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">A Self-Made Man</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wrestling-His-Angel-Political-1849-1856/dp/150115379X/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_1/141-7485861-0988151?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=150115379X&amp;pd_rd_r=a9c485bb-87bd-4934-9aed-937591fb3ecd&amp;pd_rd_w=WPRE2&amp;pd_rd_wg=C7lVx&amp;pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&amp;pf_rd_r=4TE076HKJFEC3JAZ6JHR&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=4TE076HKJFEC3JAZ6JHR">Wrestling With His Angel</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Powers-Earth-Political-1856-1863/dp/1476777284">All the Powers of Earth</a>.
