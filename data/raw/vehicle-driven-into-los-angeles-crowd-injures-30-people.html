<p>A man drove a car into a busy crowd of people waiting to get into a nightclub in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> early on Saturday, injuring 30 people, with at least five in critical condition.</p> 
<p>The driver, who is now in custody, has been identified as Fernando Ramirez, 29, and faces potential charges including attempted murder, police said.</p> 
<p>The incident took place outside The Vermont Hollywood on Santa Monica Boulevard, the city’s fire department said. A line of people, mostly women, were waiting to get into the nightclub when the car – a Nissan Versa – struck them, also hitting a taco truck and a nearby valet stand.</p> 
<p>According to Cpt Adam VanGerpen, the public information officer for the LA fire department, people were quickly transported to local hospitals and trauma centers. Parademics also determined that one of the patients had a gunshot wound, VanGerpen said.</p> 
<p>Witnesses said Ramirez was immediately grabbed and pulled him out of the car. He was also shot during the struggle, the LA police department said.</p> 
<p>He then fled the scene on foot.</p> 
<p>Images from the scene from photographers and social media show debris, including shoes, strewn across the road, as surrounding areas were sealed off and emergency response teams arrived.</p> 
<p>“This is under police investigation,” VanGerpen added. “This will be a large investigation with the LAPD.”</p> 
<p>Partygoers in the club came out immediately to help the victims before the emergency crews arrived, he said.</p> 
<p>“They were all standing in line going into a nightclub. There was a taco cart out there, so they were … getting some food, waiting to go in. And there’s also a valet line there,” VanGerpen said. “The valet podium was taken out, the taco truck was taken out, and then a large number of people were impacted by the vehicle.”</p> 
<p>The LAPD confirmed that the investigation is ongoing.</p>
