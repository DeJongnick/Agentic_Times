<p>‘I hate talking about my work.” Sally Cookson squirms. Her shows, for all their simplicity, can be hard to pin down, but her words are telling: “I’m always looking for the heart of a story,” she says. This is a director who deals in feelings.</p> <p>To those not paying attention, Cookson landed like a bolt from the blue. Most directors cut through in their 30s, but she was in her 50s when her circus-heavy staging of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/22/hetty-feather-review-stage-adaptation">Jacqueline Wilson’s Hetty Feather</a> was nominated for an Olivier award in 2015. Her calling card, however, was a magnificent, two-part <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/27/jane-eyre-lyttleton-national-theatre-review-sally-cookson-passion-and-madness">Jane Eyre</a>, a total theatre treat that translated Charlotte Brontë’s book into movement and music, colour and light. Since its premiere at the Bristol Old Vic in 2014, more than 250,000 people have seen it on stage or on screen – possibly unprecedented for a piece of devised theatre.</p> <p>It’s why, last year, Cookson got the National Theatre’s Olivier stage for Christmas – arguably the biggest family slot of the year – to put on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/04/peter-pan-review-olivier-national-theatre-london-sally-cookson-jm-barrie">Peter Pan</a>. This year, as a mark of her newfound bankability, Marianne Elliott’s new commercial company has backed her to bring Narnia to life in Leeds. The West Yorkshire Playhouse has even boosted its capacity for the purpose, transforming its 750-seat amphitheatre into a vast, 1,000-plus theatre in the round.<br></p>    <p>Cookson’s late rise says much about British theatre. Long considered a leading light in children’s theatre, creating work with Bristol’s Travelling Light, she is also one of the UK’s best creators of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/apr/21/theatre-devised-text-based">devised theatre</a>. Neither form tends to make the main stage.<br></p> <p>“Children’s literature has always been sidelined,” Cookson says over lunch. “It’s the same in theatre. It is not given the respect it deserves. We’re very snobbish about it. I wish I knew why.” If Cookson had her way, the Unicorn – <a href="https://www.unicorntheatre.com/about-us">a theatre devoted to work for young people</a> – would be attached to the National and every subsidised theatre would have kids’ shows running year-round. “As I get older, I’m more and more interested in how we get people into the theatre.”</p> <p>It was Tom Morris, Bristol Old Vic’s artistic director, who encouraged her to venture on to the main stage after he saw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/dec/19/boing-review">Travelling Light’s show Boing!</a>. “The way she uses time on stage allows her to release meaning and emotion in a very profound, very theatrical way,” he says.<strong> </strong>Cookson’s work has a rare musicality as a result. Every action is articulated and the whole thing simply flows.</p>    <p>That is rooted in Cookson’s work for children. If a show goes slack for even a second, they switch off. She says: “It would be the most painful thing, presenting an early years’ show, to hear: ‘I’m bored. Had enough now. I want to go home.’ The pain of that. It meant I hadn’t done my job properly. But the joy of seeing a five-year-old properly gripped, that’s so overwhelmingly satisfying.”<br></p> <p>For her, it happened, aged five, mid-Cinderella in Leatherhead. The Good Fairy got her. “Her wand lit up and that was it. I can still see myself lifting off my chair.” The daughter of two actors, Cookson “knew very early on theatre was something I wanted to do”. She found school frustrating, itching “to be physical”, not tied to a desk. She lived for a weekly dance class. “I had this bright-blue leotard and pale-blue tights and I felt so powerful.” Training as an actor at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, she fell for physical theatre. “The idea you could create meaningful theatre without text, through movement and music, was a revelation.”</p> <p>After early successes, she became unhappy with acting. Rejection was frequent and the work was banal. Cookson craved a challenge and longed for the creative spark of her physical theatre classes. She found it in Bristol, acting in rep. When the local youth theatre disbanded due to cuts, she set up a summer school, charging £10 a day. “Youth theatre was such a hugely influential part of my life and I was really affected by the idea it could just disappear.” Cookson was soon running the programme all year.</p> <p>Her directing style remains rooted in that: learning on the job, working with groups. “I don’t have a rule book,” she explains. “Every process is different.”<br></p>    <p>In Leeds, her rehearsal room is full: 50 people working, sometimes all together, sometimes in clumps. Writer Adam Peck peers over his laptop. Puppeteer Craig Leo looks on, arms folded, as a rudimentary Aslan snakes around the room, Chinese-dragon-style. Choreographer <a href="http://www.stillhouse.co.uk/">Dan Canham</a> clicks out the beats as the cast crouch in sync and Benji Bower, Cookson’s long-time composer, improvises a score alongside the action.</p> <p>In their midst, in a denim smock and stripes, Cookson is herself like a composer, fine-tuning each element to find the right feeling. When they run a scene, it’s immediately captivating: every second taut, everything in sync. “In order for theatre to take us out of the ordinary, you have to approach it on a very practical level,” she explains. “You have to trust that the simple tools of theatre – and they can be very simple, a couple of notes, the way you move an object – will transcend the everyday. I’m often interested in how simple that can be. How can we best tell this story?”<br></p> <p>We, not I. Her shows really do start from scratch. Cookson arrives armed with questions, some practical (“How do we make a sleigh without a set?), some abstract (“What is winter in Narnia?”). The team finds answers together. “Nobody brings anything in until we’ve started those discussions,” she says. Morris believes that is crucial: “The whole company agrees what the story is and how they’re going to tell it, so you get this terrific ensemble focus. The story can exist beyond language.”<br></p> <p>So, what is at the heart of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/may/23/review-cs-lewis-lion-witch-and-wardrobe">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>? Not Christianity, says Cookson – she’s far more interested in its latent paganism, the way the seasons unfold from eternal winter to new warmth – but children. The aim is to make the Pevensies real. “They’re evacuees, part of Operation Pied Piper.” She points to two lines in the text, a fleeting nod to air raids in London. “They’re torn from their family, ripped from familiar, safe and loving surroundings and taken to a strange place of unknowns – even before they get to Narnia. Their father’s at war. These children are traumatised.”<br></p>    <p>Narnia is an expression of that: a frozen world in stasis that is ruled by the autocratic White Witch. Although initially sceptical of staging the book – the BBC version loomed large – the idea of examining childhood at a time of turmoil, not least its resonance with today’s refugees, hooked in Cookson. “We’re in a world of so much chaos,” she says. “Families are still being ripped apart.”<br></p> <p>Next year, Cookson and her company will present <a href="https://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2018/a-monster-calls">A Monster Calls</a>, an adaptation of Patrick Ness’s bestseller about a boy coming to terms with his mother’s cancer. Cookson wanted to stage the book as soon as she had finished it: “Through stories, he learns to cope.” When Matthew Warchus, the artistic director of the Old Vic in London, mentioned the novel to her, she says: “I pulled out the dog-eared copy I’d been carrying around and replied: ‘When can I start?’”</p> <p>Childhood is central to all Cookson’s work, whether it’s aimed at adults or children. “Looking at childhood lets you consider yourself in a very truthful way,” she says. “If you can’t investigate how you came to be who you are, if you deny your childhood or block it out, you can’t really reach a sense of yourself.”<br></p> <ul> <li>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is at <a href="https://www.wyp.org.uk/">West Yorkshire Playhouse</a>, Leeds, from 29 November until 27 January.<br></li> </ul>
