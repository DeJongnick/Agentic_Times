What’s more concerning is that with the negative impact of tariffs only just starting to be felt, the coming months are likely to see even clearer evidence of a labor market slowdown.</p> <p>Of course, with Powell emphasising his focus on the unemployment rate which has only ticked up to 4.2%, perhaps it is too early to press the panic button. The shrinking of labor supply is somewhat offsetting the weakness in labor demand, keeping the labor market in an uneasy state of equilibrium. Even so, the sheer weakness of today’s payrolls number means that Powell will have to take notice. The odds of a September cut just took a big leap higher.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Thomas</strong> <strong>Ryan</strong>, North America economist, agrees that today’s weak jobs report will embolden the dovish policymakers at the Federal Reserve who want to cut interest rates, saying:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The weak 73,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in July, combined with large downward revisions to May and June’s gains and an uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.2%, will strengthen the case for those on the [federal open market committee of the Federal Reserve] pushing for imminent interest rate cuts.</p> </blockquote> <p>[<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/30/federal-reserve-interest-rates">Reminder, the Fed left rates on hold on Wednesday, in a split vote</a>.]</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-01T13:23:40.258Z">at 2.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-688cbb9a8f0871e4e6fe9f35" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-01T13:06:18.751Z">2.06pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>This chart shows just how bad the last three months have been for job creation in the US:</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/W8EZX/5/" data-alt="A chart showing US non-farm payroll data"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/W8EZX/5/">Interactive</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id="block-688cb8e48f0871e4e6fe9ef4" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-01T13:02:45.861Z">2.02pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump demands interest rate cut</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Donald Trump has again repeated his plea for the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.</strong></p> <p>Shortly after today’s weak jobs report was released, <strong>Trump</strong> posted on his Truth Social site:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Too Little, Too Late.
