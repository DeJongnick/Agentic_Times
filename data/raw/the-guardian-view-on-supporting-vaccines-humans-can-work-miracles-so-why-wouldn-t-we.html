<h1>The Guardian view on supporting vaccines: humans can work miracles – so why wouldn’t we?</h1>

<p>It is easy to become so used to scientific and social advances that we take them for granted. But sometimes we should pause to celebrate – to feel genuine awe – at the wonders that we have seen. Amid&nbsp;all the wars, the disasters and the crimes of the&nbsp;last half century, we have witnessed nothing short&nbsp;of a miracle.</p> <p>Vaccination, in addition to clean water, sanitation and improved nutrition, has been one of the greatest contributors to global health. It is responsible for much of the astounding fall in child mortality, which plummeted by 59% between 1990 and 2022. It has saved more than 150 million lives, mostly of infants, <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2024-global-immunization-efforts-have-saved-at-least-154-million-lives-over-the-past-50-years">since </a>the Expanded Programme on Immunisation was launched by the World Health Organization in 1974. Initially designed to protect children against diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, polio and measles, the scheme has since been extended to cover more pathogens. Then, in 2000, came the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (<a href="https://www.gavi.org/">Gavi</a>), a public-private organisation&nbsp;that provides financial and technical support for vaccination in poorer countries and negotiates with manufacturers to lower costs.</p> <p>The results have been remarkable. Prevention is better – and cheaper and easier – than cure. Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980. Almost all the world<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-polio-vaccination"> is now polio-free</a>. Cases of many other diseases have been slashed. Much more can be done: an estimated 5&nbsp;million children have been <a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/one-year-anniversary-malaria-vaccine-rollout-underscores-remarkable-progress-offers">protected against malaria </a>since routine vaccinations were launched a year ago. And from a scientific perspective, we are entering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/07/covid-vaccines-golden-era-pandemic-techology-diseases">a&nbsp;golden age of vaccines</a>.</p> <p>Yet this is a dangerous moment in other ways. The climate crisis is spurring disease outbreaks. Conflict has dramatically increased <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/15/war-conflict-immunisation-vaccination-vaccine-hesitancy-nutrition-disease-children-who-unicef-measles-hpv">the number of unprotected children</a>. Vaccine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/22/the-guardian-view-on-coronavirus-and-vaccine-scepticism-time-to-act">scepticism</a> has grown. Now cuts to funding threaten to turn the clock back. The trashing of USAid will hinder delivery and has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/02/trump-aid-spending-freeze-halts-leading-mvdp-malaria-vaccine-programme">halted a groundbreaking programme</a> to create new malaria vaccines. Robert F Kennedy Jr – who once claimed that “no vaccine is safe and effective” and who tried to persuade the US government to rescind authorisation for the coronavirus vaccine at the height of the pandemic –&nbsp;was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/13/rfk-health-secretary-confirmed">confirmed</a> this week as health secretary.</p> <p>Now the UK, one of Gavi’s founding donors and the country which has given most to its core programme, is considering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/10/dismay-as-uk-poised-to-cut-funding-for-global-vaccination-group-gavi">a significant cut to its support</a>. This would be a grave error. While some aspects of Gavi’s approach have faced sensible scrutiny in the past, it has vaccinated over 1&nbsp;billion children and done so cost-effectively: 97&nbsp;pence in every pound it is given goes on vaccine programmes. Its success is also evident in the number of countries which have graduated from being beneficiaries to paying their own way; some, including Indonesia, are becoming donors in turn. And Gavi’s stockpiles help to keep people safe in wealthier countries too, as well as ensuring that poorer nations are healthier and more stable.</p> <p>For all these reasons, Gavi has long enjoyed bipartisan support in the UK, which has given it more than £2bn over the last four years. Now, more than ever, its funding must be sustained. The world is full of apparently intractable conflicts and complex moral dilemmas. Few decisions are truly simple for&nbsp;governments. But this one is a no-brainer. It should astonish us that we can so easily save lives. It should be self-evident that we must continue to seize that opportunity.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
