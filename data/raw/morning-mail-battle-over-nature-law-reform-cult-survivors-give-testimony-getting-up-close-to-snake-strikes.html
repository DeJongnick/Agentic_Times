<p>Morning everyone. The Albanese government faces an uphill battle trying to push through changes to federal nature laws amid cross-party opposition – we have the latest on this political tug-of-war on a critical issue.</p>

<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>Over two days of inquiry in Victoria this week, cult survivors and experts have painted a disturbing picture of “high-control” groups, how they recruit and what impact they have on members. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/23/australia-cults-crisis-people-falling-prey-control-ntwnfb">Benita Kolovos hears</a> how people suffered emotional, physical and financial abuse, and the attraction of “simple solutions to complex problems”. </p> 
<h2>Not the news</h2>
