<p>The SNP leader John Swinney has demanded that the owner of Facebook act on Reform UK’s “racist” byelection advert that attacks the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar.</p> <p>The Facebook video, which incorrectly claims Sarwar has promised to prioritise Pakistani communities, is now subject to formal complaints from Scotland’s two main political parties. Scottish Labour contacted Meta, Facebook’s parent company, about the video two weeks ago and has yet to receive a reply.</p> <p>On Monday the Daily Record reported that the SNP chief executive, Carol Beattie, had also written to Meta, stating that the advert “appears designed to provoke division, stir racial resentment and marginalise Pakistani residents in Scotland”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/23/scottish-labour-accused-of-trying-to-hide-candidates-link-to-scandal-hit-firm">Scottish Labour accused of trying to hide candidate’s link to scandal-hit firm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The byelection for the Holyrood seat of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse, prompted by the death of the popular Nationalist MSP Christina McKelvie in March, is being fiercely contested, with Reform seemingly gaining ground from Labour and the SNP. The 5 June byelection will serve as a significant bellwether less than a year before the Scottish parliament elections due in May 2026.</p> <p>The advert reproduced a decontextualised clip of Sarwar speaking at an event celebrating the 75th anniversary of Pakistan’s independence in 2022, when he said: “Pakistanis need represented in every mainstream political party in Scotland and across the UK.” It appears alongside the text “Anas Sarwar has said he will prioritise the Pakistani community”. He does not say this anywhere in the clips shown.</p>    <p>Speaking on Monday, Swinney said: “We’ve got to address racism wherever it happens, which is why the SNP has complained to Meta about an advert attacking the Labour party, and because issues about racism are above party politics.</p> <p>“Anas Sarwar is a political rival of mine, but he shouldn’t be subjected to that kind of racist attack and we want to make sure that we stand in solidarity against the tactics of Farage.”</p> <p>Swinney said he would push back on the advert if it was referenced on the doorstep, as did the SNP’s candidate, Katy Loudon.</p> <p>Last month, Swinney held a cross-party summit in Glasgow, inviting faith groups and third-sector leaders to discuss protection of democratic values, misinformation and the rise of the far right in Scotland. On Monday he said: “One of the themes of the discussions we had in Glasgow a few weeks ago was all about misinformation and distortion. It’s debasing our politics. People can’t make informed judgments because they’re having disinformation peddled towards them.”</p> <p>Last Thursday a spokesperson for Sarwar said the advert was “blatantly racist” and that it “attempts to question the identity, loyalty and belonging of Anas Sarwar”.</p> <p>“Anas was born in Scotland and has lived here all his life. He is a proud Scot who has worked in our NHS and campaigns to deliver for every Scot. Decent people across Scotland will reject Reform’s divisive politics.”</p> <p>The Reform UK councillor Thomas Kerr said: “John Swinney and Anas Sarwar are desperately trying to deflect attention away from the facts. This advert uses Mr Sarwar’s own words – if he doesn’t like them, he shouldn’t use them.</p> <p>“The SNP and Labour have both broken Scotland, it’s no surprise they’re now forming some sort of pathetic and panicky anti-Reform coalition. The more Reform grows the more desperate their lies and smears will get but we’re ready for it. Unlike them we aren’t fighting for our careers, we’re fighting for our country.”</p> <p>Despite McKelvie’s substantial majority when she held the seat, Swinney also acknowledged that the contest was “tight” and “still very difficult to call”.</p>
