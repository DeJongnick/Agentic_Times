 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It is 6pm in <strong>Kyiv</strong> and 7pm in <strong>Moscow</strong>. This liveblog will be closing soon but you can keep up to date on the Guardian’s latest coverage of Russia and Ukraine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">here</a>.</p> 
  <p>Here are the latest developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Abandoning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> would jeopardise British, European and American security and lead to “infinitely higher” costs in the long term, the head of MI6 has warned in a speech that amounted to a plea to Donald Trump to continue supporting Kyiv. </strong>Richard Moore, giving a rare speech, said he believed Vladimir Putin “would not stop” at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> if he was allowed to subjugate it in any peace talks involving the incoming US Republican administration.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Moore accused Russia of waging a “staggeringly reckless campaign” of sabotage in Europe while also stepping up its nuclear sabre-rattling to scare other countries off from backing Ukraine. </strong>“Our security – British, French, European and transatlantic- will be jeopardised,” he said during an address given in Paris alongside his French counterpart.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russian defence minister, Andrei Belousov, on Friday hailed “expanding” ties with North Korea during a visit to the country for talks with its military and political leaders.</strong> “Friendly ties between Russia and North Korea are actively expanding in all areas, including military cooperation,” he was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying during the visit.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russia launched more than 100 drones at Ukraine overnight and early on Friday, killing one person and injuring eight others, officials said. </strong>A drone attack killed a woman in the southern city of Kherson, the head of the local military administration, Roman Mrochko, said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A drone attack on the southern region of Odesa damaged 13 residential buildings and injured seven people</strong>, the national police said in a statement. Fragments from downed Russian drones struck buildings in two Kyiv districts and injured one person late on Thursday, officials said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ukrainian emergency services, in a post on the Telegram messaging app, showed pictures of rubble strewn about inside and outside a pediatric clinic in Kyiv’s Dniprovskyi district on the east bank of the Dnipro River</strong>. A security guard at the facility was taken to hospital and adjacent buildings suffered damage. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said drone fragments had struck an infrastructure site in the Sviatoshynskyi district on the West Bank of the river. Kyiv regional governor, Ruslan Kravchenko, reported minor damage to a private residence and another building without any casualties.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>At least two regions suffered power cuts on Friday, Ukrainian electricity operator Ukrenergo said.</strong> Local media reported that 70% of customers in Mykolaiv and the surrounding region had been without electricity for a second day as a result of Russian attacks on the energy infrastructure.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Moscow said on Friday it had seized the village of Rozdolne in the southern part of Ukraine’s Donbas region</strong>, where it has made a string of territorial gains in recent months.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russia downed 47 attack drones fired overnight by Ukraine, mainly targeting the Rostov border region</strong> where a major fire broke out at an industrial site, authorities said. Ukraine’s military said on Friday it had struck the Atlas oil depot in Russia’s Rostov region overnight, causing a fire. Ukraine also struck a radar station for a Russian Buk air defence system in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region, a military statement said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The number of people injured by a Russian strike on Daryiv in the Kherson region has risen to two</strong>, according to local authorities. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that one of those injured, a 57-year-old woman, had been hospitalised</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi visited two key Ukrainian-held sites in the Donetsk region, the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhhove</strong>, where he said Ukrainian forces were continuing to repel Russian advances.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles, an intermediate-range weapon that Moscow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/russia-fired-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-at-dnipro-says-ukraine">used against the city of Dnipro last week</a> and that Putin has claimed cannot be shot down by any air defence system. </strong>“We do not rule out the use of Oreshnik against the military, military-industrial facilities or decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,” Putin said at a press conference in Kazakhstan on Thursday.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Police have clashed with protesters in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, after the country’s ruling party said the government would suspend talks on EU accession until 2028. </strong>Police fired water cannon and deployed pepper spray and teargas to disperse protesters as masked people tried to smash their way into the parliament. Some protesters threw fireworks at police while shouting “Russians” and “slaves”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ukraine on Friday accused Georgia of trying to “please Moscow”. </strong>Ukraine’s foreign ministry said: “Ukraine is disappointed by the decision of the Georgian government to suspend EU accession negotiations until 2028. This decision, as well as the use of force against a peaceful protest, is evidence of the curtailment of democratic processes in the country to please Moscow.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Russian rouble will strengthen when temporary speculative factors and market nervousness are gone, but the economy will need adapt to new US sanctions targeting the banking sector, economy minister, Maxim Reshetnikov, said on Friday. </strong>“It is evident that adaptation to the new anti-Russian sanctions will be necessary, including changes to banking mechanisms and channels for currency inflows into the Russian market,” Reshetnikov said in a statement</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ukraine on Friday said Russian authorities returned more than 500 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in combat</strong>, with most having died in the eastern Donetsk region. “As a result of repatriation activities, the bodies of 502 fallen defenders were returned to territory controlled by the government of Ukraine,” Kyiv’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said on social media. Russia, for its part, does not announce the return of its bodies.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russia on Friday sentenced Alexei Gorinov, the first person to be convicted for speaking out against Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine, to another three years in prison in a second trial. </strong>The 63-year-old is already serving a seven-year sentence after a conviction in 2022. He wore a paper badge with a peace sign drawn on it as a court in Vladimir handed him the new sentence on charges of “justifying terrorism”, the Medizazona website reported.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s plan to tap the retired US lieutenant general Keith Kellogg as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored that proposes ending the war by withdrawing weapons from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> if it doesn’t enter peace talks</strong> <strong>– and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> doesn’t do the same. </strong>Trump is said to have responded favorably to the plan – <a href="https://americafirstpolicy.com/issues/america-first-russia-ukraine">America First, Russia &amp; Ukraine</a> – which was presented to him in April and was written by Kellogg and the former CIA analyst Fred Fleitz, who both served as chiefs of staff in Trump’s national security council from 2017 to 2021.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Germany’s domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has set up a taskforce to head off any foreign state attempts to influence the upcoming federal election after last month warning of increased Russian-sponsored espionage and sabotage</strong>. It said possible attempts at disinformation, cyber-attack, spying or sabotage could be made ahead of the snap vote set for 23 February after the collapse earlier this month of chancellor Olaf Scholz’s fractious three-way coalition.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Scholz, assured Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, of Germany’s continued support in a call on Friday in which they agreed to stay in contact</strong>, also with a view on possible paths to a just peace, he said on social platform X.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Swedish police said that an unidentified drone flew over the Russian embassy in Stockholm early on Friday, dropping paint on the grounds of the diplomatic compound. </strong>No arrests have been made and no suspects identified, a police spokesperson added. There was a reported case of vandalism at Sweden’s embassy in Moscow on Thursday, and Sweden’s foreign minister Maria Malmer Stenergard has urged Russia to ensure the protection of Sweden’s diplomatic mission and its staff.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, will travel to China next week, where she will meet her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, to discuss issues including the war in Ukraine</strong>, said a ministry spokesperson on Friday.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Abandoning Ukraine means ‘infinitely higher’ long-term security costs, MI6 chief says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Abandoning <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a></strong> would jeopardise <strong>British</strong>, <strong>European</strong> and <strong>American</strong> security and lead to “infinitely higher” costs in the long term, the head of <strong>MI6</strong> has warned in a speech that amounted to a plea to <strong>Donald Trump</strong> to continue supporting <strong>Kyiv</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Richard Moore</strong>, giving a rare speech, said he believed <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> “would not stop” at Ukraine if he was allowed to subjugate it in any peace talks involving the incoming <strong>US</strong> Republican administration.</p> 
  <p>“If Putin is allowed to succeed in reducing Ukraine to a vassal state, he will not stop there. Our security – British, French, European and transatlantic – will be jeopardised,” Moore said during an address given in <strong>Paris</strong> alongside his <strong>French</strong> counterpart.</p> 
  <p>The spy chief was touted earlier this week as a possible surprise appointment as the <strong>UK</strong>’s ambassador to the US, though he is not thought to be pressing for the job. The former Labour minister <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/08/downing-street-to-appoint-new-us-ambassador-within-days">Peter Mandelson</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/08/downing-street-to-appoint-new-us-ambassador-within-days"> is considered the frontrunner</a> for a critical role at a delicate time in transatlantic relations.</p> 
  <p>Moore has served as the head of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi6">MI6</a> for four years in what is normally considered a five-year job. At the start of his tenure he overlapped with the Trump adviser <strong>Richard Grenell</strong>, who was the acting director of national intelligence and has now been identified as a possible US envoy tasked with trying to find an end to the war in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Trump has complained about the expense of supporting Kyiv and said repeatedly that he wants to end the war, claiming he could do so “within 24 hours”. <strong>JD Vance</strong>, the vice-president-elect, has suggested freezing the conflict on the current frontlines, and denying Ukraine <strong>Nato</strong> membership for an extended period.</p> 
  <p>“The cost of supporting Ukraine is well known,” said Moore. “But the cost of not doing so would be infinitely higher. If Putin succeeds, China would weigh the implications, North Korea would be emboldened and Iran would become still more dangerous.”</p> 
  <p>A key British argument to the incoming Trump administration is to try to link the war in Ukraine with US concerns about the rising military might of <strong>China</strong>, emphasising that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/ukrainians-ready-for-north-korean-troops-russia-war">the arrival of </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/ukrainians-ready-for-north-korean-troops-russia-war">North Korean</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/ukrainians-ready-for-north-korean-troops-russia-war"> troops</a> is bringing authoritarianism from <strong>Asia</strong> into what was previously a <strong>European</strong> conflict.</p>

  <p><strong>Germany</strong>’s domestic intelligence agency <strong>(BfV)</strong> has set up a taskforce to head off any foreign state attempts to influence the upcoming federal election after last month warning of increased <strong>Russian</strong>-sponsored espionage and sabotage, reports Reuters.</p> 
  <p>It said possible attempts at disinformation, cyber-attack, spying or sabotage could be made ahead of the snap vote set for 23 February after the collapse earlier this month of chancellor <strong>Olaf Scholz</strong>’s fractious three-way coalition. </p> 
  <p>“Against the backdrop of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, Russia probably has the greatest and most obvious interest in influencing the election in its own favour,” the BfV said in a statement, noting it was also keeping an eye on other actors. Such actors could seek to actively support individual candidates or parties or discredit other candidates and parties or the democratic process itself, seizing on opportunities, the BfV said. </p> 
  <p>Germany is <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s second biggest financial and military backer. That has resulted in a sharp rise in “aggressive behaviour” by the <strong>Kremlin</strong> towards Germany, as to other Ukraine allies, the head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency said last month.</p> 
  <p>Parcels that exploded at logistics depots in <strong>Europe</strong> including in Germany, for example, were part of a test run for a Russian plot to trigger explosions on cargo flights to the <strong>US</strong>, according to western security officials, reports Reuters. </p> 
  <p>Acts of sabotage could, in addition to causing physical damage, also have a psychological impact on voters as well as on political decision makers, the BfV said. </p> 
  <p>According to Reuters, the BfV also warned against disinformation, given that Russia had been “offensively increasing” the distribution of pro-Russian and anti-western narratives, hoping to divide German society and reduce support for Ukraine. </p> 
  <p>Cyber-attacks, in particular hack-and-leak operations, were a further danger, as well as the use of artificial intelligence to produce deepfake videos to dupe voters, it said. </p> 
  <p>Support for Russia-friendly parties – notably the far-right <strong>Alternative for Germany (AfD)</strong> and the far-left <strong>Sahra Wagenknecht Aliance</strong> – has been on the rise in recent months, with both parties faring well in elections in eastern Germany in September. </p> 
  <p>In April, a senior member of the AfD was accused of receiving money from a pro-Russian media site, allegations he denied.</p>

  <p>Thousands of pro-EU protesters had blocked streets in the capital before the altercations began. The country’s outgoing pro-EU figurehead president, <strong>Salome Zourabichvili</strong>, accused the government of declaring “war” on its own people and confronted riot police, asking whether they served Georgia or <strong>Russia</strong>.</p> 
  <p>“Today marks a significant point, or rather, the conclusion of the constitutional coup that has been unfolding for several weeks,” she told a news conference alongside opposition leaders. “Today, this nonexistent and illegitimate government declared war on its own people,” she added, calling herself the Georgia’s “sole legitimate representative”.</p> 
  <p>The government announcement came hours after the European parliament adopted a non-binding resolution rejecting the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/georgia-election-final-recount-ruling-party-victory-electoral-commission"> results of Georgia’s 26 October parliamentary elections</a>, alleging “significant irregularities”.</p> 
  <p>The resolution called for new elections within a year under international supervision and for sanctions to be imposed on top Georgian officials from the ruling <strong>Georgian Dream (GD) party</strong>, including the prime minister, <strong>Irakli Kobakhidze</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Ukraine</strong> on Friday said <strong>Russian</strong> authorities returned more than 500 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in combat, with most having died in the eastern <strong>Donetsk</strong> region.</p> 
  <p>Russia and Ukraine have been exchanging bodies and prisoners of war since the first months of the conflict – with casualties estimated to be high on both sides.</p> 
  <p>“As a result of repatriation activities, the bodies of 502 fallen defenders were returned to territory controlled by the government of Ukraine,” <strong>Kyiv</strong>’s <strong>Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War</strong> said on social media, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Russia behind 'staggeringly reckless' sabotage in Europe, says head of UK's MI6</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Russia</strong> is waging a “staggeringly reckless campaign” of sabotage in <strong>Europe</strong> while also stepping up its nuclear sabre-rattling to scare other countries off from backing <strong>Ukraine</strong>, the head of the <strong>UK</strong>’s <strong>Secret Intelligence Service</strong> known as <strong>MI6</strong>, said on Friday.</p> 
  <p><strong>Richard Moore</strong> said in a speech in <strong>Paris</strong> on Friday that were <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> to succeed in reducing <strong>Ukraine</strong> to a vassal state, he would not stop there, reports Reuters.</p> 
  <p>“Our security – British, French, European and transatlantic- will be jeopardised,” he said, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have recently uncovered a staggeringly reckless campaign of Russian sabotage in Europe, even as Putin and his acolytes resort to nuclear sabre-rattling to sow fear about the consequences of aiding Ukraine.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said the cost of supporting Ukraine was well known, but added: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The cost of not doing so would be infinitely higher. If Putin succeeds China would weigh the implications, North Korea would be emboldened and Iran would become still more dangerous.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Reuters repots that Moore’s speech seemed aimed at rallying wavering European allies and any sceptics in the incoming <strong>US</strong> administration of <strong>Donald Trump</strong> about the importance of Ukraine. He joins other western intelligence officials in warning about increasing Russian sabotage actions.</p> 
  <p><strong>Nato</strong> and western intelligence services have said that Russia is behind a growing number of hostile activities across the <strong>Euro-Atlantic</strong> area, ranging from repeated cyber-attacks to <strong>Moscow</strong>-linked arson – all of which Russia denies. </p> 
  <p>The UK’s domestic spy chief said last month that Russia’s <strong>GRU military intelligence service</strong> was seeking to cause “mayhem” across the UK and Europe. And sources familiar with US intelligence told Reuters this week that Russia was likely to expand its campaign of sabotage against European targets to increase pressure on the west over its support for <strong>Kyiv</strong>. </p> 
  <p>Moore added that cooperation between the UK and the US had made its societies safer, and that that would continue. “I worked successfully with the first Trump administration to advance our shared security and look forward to doing so again,” he said.</p>

  <p><strong>Russia</strong> launched more than 100 drones at <strong>Ukraine</strong> overnight and early on Friday, killing one person and injuring eight others, officials said.</p> 
  <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that Friday’s drone barrage came a day after Russia launched about 90 missiles on Ukraine, cutting power to over a million people.</p> 
  <p>A drone attack killed a woman in the southern city of <strong>Kherson</strong>, the head of the local military administration, <strong>Roman Mrochko</strong>, said. Meanwhile, at least two regions suffered power cuts on Friday, Ukrainian electricity operator <strong>Ukrenergo</strong> said.</p> 
  <p>“Emergency repair works are ongoing around the clock. By the end of the day, the power company plans to restore power to the de-energised customers in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions,” it said, according to AFP.</p> 
  <p>Moscow said on Friday it had seized the village of <strong>Rozdolne</strong> in the southern part of Ukraine’s <strong>Donbas</strong> region, where it has made a string of territorial gains in recent months.</p> 
  <p>Russia downed 47 attack drones fired overnight by Ukraine, mainly targeting the <strong>Rostov</strong> border region where a major fire broke out at an industrial site, authorities said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump’s Ukraine envoy pick proposed forcing peace talks by withdrawing US weapons</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a></strong>’s plan to tap the retired <strong>US</strong> lieutenant general <strong>Keith Kellogg</strong> as US envoy to <strong>Ukraine</strong> and <strong>Russia</strong> has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored that proposes ending the war by withdrawing weapons from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> if it doesn’t enter peace talks – and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> doesn’t do the same.</p> 
  <p>Trump is said to have responded favorably to the plan – <a href="https://americafirstpolicy.com/issues/america-first-russia-ukraine">America First, Russia &amp; Ukraine</a> – which was presented to him in April and was written by Kellogg and the former <strong>CIA</strong> analyst <strong>Fred Fleitz</strong>, who both served as chiefs of staff in Trump’s national security council from 2017 to 2021.</p> 
  <p>The document proposes halting further US weapons deliveries to <strong>Kyiv</strong> if it does not enter peace talks with <strong>Moscow</strong>, while simultaneously warning Moscow that, should it refuse to negotiate, US support for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> would increase.</p> 
  <p>It blames “unserious and incoherent” US foreign policy under <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a></strong> for the three-year conflict, including what it describes as a “precipitous” US withdrawal from <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, the supposed antagonization of US allies including <strong>Israel</strong> and <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, and a policy to <strong>China</strong> described as “weak and confusing”.</p> 
  <p>The paper further accuses the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration">Biden administration</a> of putting “the idealistic agendas of the global elite ahead of a working relationship with Russia” – a “hostile policy” that it claims “made it an enemy of the US, drove Russia into the arms of China and led to the development of a new Russia-China-Iran-North Korea axis”.</p> 
  <p>Kellogg and Fleitz criticize what they said was a decision to scold <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a></strong> and threaten “unprecedented” sanctions as it prepared to invade Ukraine, “instead of using negotiations to de-escalate tensions”.</p> 
  <p>“An America First approach could have prevented the invasion,” they write.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Russia's economy will need to adapt to new US sanctions, economy minister says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Russian</strong> rouble will strengthen when temporary speculative factors and market nervousness are gone, but the economy will need adapt to new <strong>US</strong> sanctions targeting the banking sector, economy minister, <strong>Maxim Reshetnikov</strong>, said on Friday. </p> 
  <p>“It is evident that adaptation to the new anti-Russian sanctions will be necessary, including changes to banking mechanisms and channels for currency inflows into the Russian market,” Reshetnikov said in a statement, reports Reuters.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/russias-rouble-plunges-to-lowest-rate-since-early-weeks-of-ukraine-war">Russia’s rouble plunged recently to its lowest rate against the dollar </a>since the early weeks of the full-scale invasion of <strong>Ukraine</strong> in the wake of new western sanctions and growing geopolitical tensions.</p> 
  <p>The rouble on Wednesday hit 110 against the dollar for the first time since 16 March 2022. Before launching its war on Ukraine in February 2022, the Russian currency traded at around 75-80 against the US dollar.</p> 
  <p>The latest drop came just days after the US introduced sanctions against <strong>Gazprombank</strong>, Russia’s third-largest bank, which played a key role in processing payments for the remaining Russian natural gas exports to <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a></strong>.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Putin threatens to hit Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> has threatened to strike <strong>Kyiv</strong> with Oreshnik missiles, an intermediate-range weapon that <strong>Moscow</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/russia-fired-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-at-dnipro-says-ukraine">used against the city of </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/russia-fired-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-at-dnipro-says-ukraine">Dnipro</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/russia-fired-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-at-dnipro-says-ukraine"> last week</a> and that Putin has claimed cannot be shot down by any air defence system.</p> 
  <p>“We do not rule out the use of Oreshnik against the military, military-industrial facilities or decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,” Putin said at a press conference in <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> on Thursday. He said the weapon was “comparable in strength to a nuclear strike” if used several times on one location, though he added that it was not currently fitted with nuclear warheads.</p> 
  <p>“The kinetic impact is powerful, like a meteorite falling,” Putin said. “We know in history what meteorites have fallen where, and what the consequences were. Sometimes it was enough for whole lakes to form.”</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Ukrainian</strong> president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong>, accused <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a></strong> of a “despicable escalation”.</p> 
  <p>Moscow has said the new threats are a response to a decision earlier this month by the <strong>US</strong>, <strong>Britain</strong> and <strong>France</strong> to allow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> to fire long-range missiles provided by them against military targets inside Russia, something Kyiv had long requested.</p> 
  <p>Kyiv is better protected than most other Ukrainian cities by air defence batteries, and there have been few successful strikes on the centre of the capital during almost three years of war. <strong>Mykhailo Podolyak</strong>, an adviser to the Ukrainian president described Putin’s claim that air defence systems could not take out Oreshnik missiles as “fiction, of course”.</p> 
  <p>“Putin doesn’t understand military stuff. He’s a guy that people come and show him some cartoon about how the missile will fly, how nobody will be able to shoot it down. He said the same thing many times about their Kinzhal missile. And then when it turned out that Patriot [air defence systems], even the not-the-latest-generation systems, can comfortably shoot it down, he stopped talking about it,” Podolyak said.</p> 
  <p>Podolyak also said there was “no such thing” as Oreshnik and that the missile was simply a lightly modified version of existing Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles. “The man has just come up with a name, just an abstract name,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Nonetheless, the threats have caused alarm in Kyiv, causing a sitting of parliament scheduled for last Friday to be cancelled.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Russian</strong> drone attacks on <strong>Ukraine</strong> injured at least eight people and damaged residential buildings in the capital <strong>Kyiv</strong> and in the southern <strong>Odesa region</strong> overnight, officials said on Friday, reports Reuters. </p> 
  <p>Ukraine’s air force said in a statement that, of 132 drones launched against the country overnight, it had downed 88 drones, while 41 were “lost”, likely due to electronic warfare, and one returned to the Russian territory. </p> 
  <p>Russia has stepped up its nightly drone attacks on Ukrainian cities as it continues to push along the eastern frontline, making some of its largest monthly territorial gains since 2022. It launched a record-high number of 188 drones against the country on Tuesday before staging a large-scale attack on Ukraine’s power grid on Thursday. </p> 
  <p>The drone attack on the southern region of Odesa damaged 13 residential buildings and injured seven people, the national police said in a statement. </p> 
  <p>Fragments from downed Russian drones struck buildings in two Kyiv districts and injured one person late on Thursday, officials said. </p> 
  <p>Emergency services, in a post on the Telegram messaging app, showed pictures of rubble strewn about inside and outside a pediatric clinic in Kyiv’s <strong>Dniprovskyi district</strong> on the east bank of the <strong>Dnipro River</strong>. A security guard at the facility was taken to hospital and adjacent buildings suffered damage, reports Reuters.</p> 
  <p>Mayor <strong>Vitali Klitschko</strong> said drone fragments had struck an infrastructure site in the <strong>Sviatoshynskyi district</strong> on the West Bank of the river. Kyiv regional governor, <strong>Ruslan Kravchenko</strong>, reported minor damage to a private residence and another building without any casualties.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Russian defence minister says ties with North Korea 'expanding in all areas' during visit</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Russian</strong> defence minister, <strong>Andrei Belousov</strong>, arrived in <strong>North Korea</strong> on Friday for talks with North Korean military and political leaders as the countries deepen their alignment over Russia’s war on <strong>Ukraine</strong>. <br><br>According to the Associated Press, the defence ministry in announcing the visit did not specify who Belousov would be meeting or the purpose of the talks. North Korean state media did not immediately confirm the visit either.</p> 
  <p>Photos released by Russia’s defence ministry showed Belousov walking alongside North Korean defense minister, <strong>No Kwang Chol</strong>, on a red carpet laid out at a <strong>Pyongyang </strong>airport. According to the AP, North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that Belousov on Friday hailed “expanding” ties with North Korea. “Friendly ties between Russia and North Korea are actively expanding in all areas, including military cooperation,” he was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying during a visit to the country.</p> 
  <p>The visit came days after <strong>South Korean</strong> president, <strong>Yoon Suk Yeol</strong>, met with a Ukrainian delegation led by defense minister, <strong>Rustem Umerov</strong>, in the South Korean capital of <strong>Seoul</strong> and called for the two countries to formulate countermeasures in response to North Korea’s dispatch of troops to Russia in support of its fight against Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>North Korean leader, <strong>Kim Jong-un</strong>, in recent months has prioritised relations with Russia as he tries to break out of isolation and strengthen his international footing, embracing the idea of a “new cold war”, reports the AP.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>US</strong> and its allies have said North Korea has sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia in recent weeks and that some of those troops were engaging in combat.</p> 
  <p>On Thursday,<strong> Joe Biden</strong> said Russia’s latest attack on Ukraine shows the “urgency” of backing <strong>Kyiv</strong>, touting strong support ahead of <strong>Donald Trump</strong> taking office in January.</p> 
  <p>“This attack is outrageous and serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their defence against Russian aggression,” Biden said in a statement.</p> 
  <p>Earlier on Thursday, Russia pummelled Ukraine’s energy grid with almost 200 missiles and drones, leaving a million people without power.</p> 
  <p>“On this day, my message to the Ukrainian people is clear: the United States stands with you,” added Biden.</p>
