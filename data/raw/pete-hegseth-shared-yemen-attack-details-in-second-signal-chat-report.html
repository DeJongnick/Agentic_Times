<p>Before the US launched military strikes on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen">Yemen</a> in March, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, the defense secretary, sent detailed information about the planned attacks to a private Signal group chat that he created himself, which included his wife, his brother and about a dozen other people, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">the New York Times reported</a> on Sunday.</p> <p>The Guardian has independently confirmed the existence of Hegseth’s own private group chat.</p> <p>According to unnamed sources familiar with the chat who spoke to the Times, Hegseth sent the private group of his personal associates some of the same information, including the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets that would strike Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, that he also shared with another Signal group of top officials that was created by Mike Waltz, the national security adviser.</p> <p>The existence of the Signal group chat created by Waltz, in which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/journalist-trump-yemen-war-chat-reaction">detailed attack plans were divulged</a> by Hegseth to other Trump administration officials on the private messaging app, was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">made public last month</a> by Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic, who had been accidentally added to the group by Waltz.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/signal-group-chat-leak-how-it-happened">Exclusive: how the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg got added to the White House Signal group chat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that Hegseth also shared the plans in a second Signal group chat, according to “people familiar with the matter” who spoke to the Times, is likely to add to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/18/defense-secretary-chief-of-staff-joe-kasper-departure-00299508">growing criticism</a> of the former Fox weekend anchor’s ability to manage the Pentagon, a huge organization which operates in matters of life and death around the globe.</p> <p>According to the Times, the private chat also included two senior advisers to Hegseth – Dan Caldwell and Darin Selnick – who were fired last week after being accused of leaking unauthorized information.</p> <p>Hegseth has previously been criticized for including his wife, Jennifer, a former Fox News producer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/29/pete-hegseth-wife-jennifer-foreign-defense-official-meetings">in sensitive meetings with foreign leaders</a>, including <a href="https://youtu.be/sYLUIBBUNJ0?feature=shared">a discussion of the war in Ukraine</a> with Britain’s most senior defense officials at the Pentagon last month, during which she was <a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/image/8902070/sd-hegseth-hosts-bilateral-exchange-with-uk-secretary-state-defense">pictured</a> sitting directly behind her husband. Phil Hegseth, the secretary’s younger brother, is a podcast producer who was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-brother-signal-dhs-hired-68678a8a653c79a4c6ae31a8bee64836">recently hired</a> as a Department of Homeland Security liaison to the Pentagon. It is unclear why either would need to know the details of strike plans in advance.</p> <p>According to the Times, Hegseth used his private phone, rather than a government device, to access the Signal chat with his family and friends.</p> <p>CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/20/politics/hegseth-second-signal-chat-military-plans/index.html">reported later on Sunday</a> that three sources familiar with Hegseth’s private Signal group confirmed to the broadcaster that he had used it to share Yemen attack plans before the strikes were launched.</p> <p>The same information was also confirmed to the Associated Press by a source familiar with the group chat who said that it included 13 people.</p> <p>Shortly after the news of the second Signal chat broke, Politico published an opinion article by Hegseth’s former press secretary, John Ullyot, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/04/20/pentagon-chaos-ullyot-hegseth-00205594">which began</a>: “It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon. From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president – who deserves better from his senior leadership.”</p>
