<p>Nuclear whistleblowers who try to draw attention to cultural and safety issues face bullying, MPs have warned.</p> <p>Members of parliament’s public accounts committee have said they are concerned about the way people who raise concerns about culture and safety on nuclear sites are treated.</p> <p>“There is generally a problem with whistleblowing and a safety culture,” said Rachel Gilmour, a Liberal Democrat MP, when quizzing nuclear bosses on Thursday.</p> <p>“That relation between bullying and safety within a nuclear context” needs greater examination, Gilmour said, adding that her office was seeking to raise the issue further with regulators.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/11/incidents-hazardous-industrial-sites-england-going-unchecked-recruitment-crisis-major-accident-hazards">Incidents at English hazardous industrial sites ‘going unchecked’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/06/sellafield-toxic-culture-bullying-harassment-safety">Nuclear Leaks</a> investigation has revealed claims of bullying, sexual harassment and drug use at the nuclear waste dump, Sellafield, which could put safety at risk.</p> <p>Gilmour’s interjection followed a refusal by Euan Hutton, the chief executive of the Sellafield site, to apologise for its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/06/sellafield-toxic-culture-bullying-harassment-safety">treatment of an HR consultant, Alison McDermott</a>, when asked to by Anna Dixon, a Labour MP. Hutton also refused to say whether he considered the cost of the case against McDermott to be a good use of public funds.</p> <p>Sellafield, in Cumbria, spent about £750,000 in its pursuit of McDermott’s claim that she was wrongfully dismissed after raising concerns of a “toxic culture” at the Sellafield site.</p> <p>McDermott was found by a judge to have blown the whistle by raising reports of harassment. The judgment was made in 2023, after an appeal over the findings of an employment tribunal. </p> <p>However, her wrongful dismissal claim was not upheld. Sellafield, along with the oversight body the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), sought to recoup costs of £40,000. A judge reduced these to £5,000. McDermott told the Guardian she intends to appeal against this decision.</p> <p>Dixon said she was “disappointed” by Hutton’s response. She said it was “critical for a safety culture” that people feel able to speak up.</p> <p>Hutton acknowledged there had been problems faced by staff but that there had been progress in recent years.</p> <p>“We’ve had an improvement … [in employment surveys], we’re not complacent, we’ve got a lot to do,” he said. “We have robust processes” for dealing with any safety concerns raised by staff, he added.</p> <p>Hutton also acknowledged <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/04/sellafield-nuclear-site-hacked-groups-russia-china">major cybersecurity failings</a> at the site, which were also first revealed by the Guardian.</p> <p>He said that “as an organisation we let ourselves down”, by failing to meet standards, but he repeated denials that the world’s largest plutonium store had been subject to “successful” cyber-attacks.</p> <p>Sellafield was ordered to pay nearly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/02/sellafield-ordered-to-pay-nearly-400000-over-cybersecurity-failings">£400,000 after pleading guilty</a> to leaving data that could threaten national security exposed for four years.</p>
