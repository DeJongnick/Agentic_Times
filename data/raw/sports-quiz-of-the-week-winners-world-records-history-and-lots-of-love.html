    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - In 1983 and 1984., 2:D - Quinn was the first. He scored all three goals when Coventry beat Arsenal 3-0 at Highbury on the opening day in 1993. How times change. , 3:B - “Daily Dale” set a Guinness world record by surfing every day for 40 years from 1975 to 2015., 4:A - Williams, who was unseeded, reached the final in 1997. She was beaten by Martina Hingis but went on to win the tournament in 2000 and 2001. “I’m still the same player,” she said this week. “I’m a big hitter. This is my brand.”, 5:C - Real Madrid are against the idea of moving the game to the US. As is the Spain goalkeeper Unai Simón, who said: “Football is about the fans. If it weren’t for them, we wouldn’t exist. There are many fans who can’t go to Miami. To me, taking a league match abroad seems disrespectful to the fans.” Well said, Unai. , 6:D - “My two favourite English players ever are Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne and I know they both wore No 18 here,” said Grealish after he joined the club on loan this week. “As soon as I knew this deal was close, I had a look and No 18 was free, so that was perfect for me. I spoke to Wayne and mentioned that to him – about the No 18 – so I hope he’s happy as well.”, 7:D - The club, who have finished bottom of the Premiership for the last three years running, have been bought over by the Austrian company., 8:D - Since the tournament launched in 1991, it has been won by New Zealand six times, England twice and USA once. , 9:B - Only eight of the last 33 Community Shield winners have gone on to lift the league title later that season. None of the last five winners has won the title in the same season, and just one of the last 14 has done it – Manchester City in the 2018-19 season. , 10:B - Many congratulations to Fury and his wife Paris, who renewed their vows again this week in France. , 11:A - Their shirt looks far better without one. , 12:B - “It was amazing when we took the field,” said Jen Pawol, who was the first base umpire in the game. “It seemed like quite a few people were clapping and calling my name. That was pretty intense and emotional.” , 13:B - Duplantis broke the men’s pole vault world record for the 13th time – and third this year – with a clearance of 6.29m at the Hungarian Grand Prix., 14:A - Uefa has discussed the idea of turning the Super Cup into a four-team tournament in future seasons. Just what the players need – even more games. , 15:C - Aberdeen in 1983 and Manchester United in 1991., 16:B - Atlético Madrid bucked the trend by beating Real Madrid 4-2 in the Super Cup in 2018. </p>
