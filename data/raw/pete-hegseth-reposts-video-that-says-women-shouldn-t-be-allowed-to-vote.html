<p>The US defense secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, recently shared a video in which several pastors say women should no longer be allowed to vote, prompting one progressive evangelical organization to express concern.</p> <p>Hegseth reposted a CNN <a href="https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1953626931234054558">segment</a> on X on Thursday that focuses on pastor Doug Wilson, a Christian nationalist who co-founded the Idaho-based Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), In the segment, he raises the idea of women not voting.</p> <p>“I would like to see this nation being a Christian nation, and I would like this world to be a Christian world,” Wilson said.</p> <p>Another pastor interview by CNN for its segment, Toby Sumpter, said: “In my ideal society, we would vote as households. I would ordinarily be the one to cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.”</p> <p>A congregant interviewed for the segment remarked that she considers her husband as the head their household, and added: “I do submit to him.”</p> <p>Hegseth reposted the nearly seven-minute report with the caption: “All of Christ for All of Life.”</p> <p>Later in the video, Wilson says he does not believe women should hold leadership positions in the military or be able to fill high-profile combat roles.</p> <p>A statement from Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell on Saturday said Hegseth “is a proud member of a church affiliated with” the CREC.</p> <p>“The secretary very much appreciates many of Mr Wilson’s writings and teachings.”</p> <p>Hegseth and his family were in attendance at the Wilson church’s inaugural service in Washington in July, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/07/politics/pastor-doug-wilson-christian-domination-trump">according to CNN</a>.</p> <p>Doug Pagitt, a pastor and the executive director of the progressive evangelical organization Vote Common Good, told the Associated Press that the ideas in the video are views that “small fringes of Christians keep” and said it was “very disturbing” that Hegseth would amplify them.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/31/hegseth-defense-secretary-polygraphs">Pete Hegseth’s aides used polygraphs against their own Pentagon colleagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hegseth’s repost on Thursday came as the Trump administration ramps up efforts to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/28/trump-evangelicals-christians">promote</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/16/christian-nationalists-trump-administration">Christian nationalism</a>. The push follows Donald Trump’s renewed alliance with the Christian right in his second presidential term, whose moves have included an executive order <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/trumps-executive-order-anti-christian-bias">creating a federal taskforce</a> to investigate what he calls “anti-Christian bias” in government agencies.</p> <p>The president also created a White House faith office <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishment-of-the-white-house-faith-office/">in February</a>, saying it would make recommendations to him “regarding changes to policies, programs and practices” and consult with outside experts in “combating antisemitic, anti-Christian and additional forms of anti-religious bias”.</p> <p>In May, Hegseth invited his personal pastor, Brooks Potteiger, to the Pentagon to lead the first of several Christian prayer services that the defense secretary has held inside the government building during working hours. Defense department employees and service members said they received invitations to the event in their government emails.</p> <p>The US constitution’s first amendment prohibits the government from establishing a state religion. But the US courts’ administrative office <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/first-amendment-and-religion">says</a> the precise definition of “establishment” in that context historically has been unclear, especially with the constitution also protecting all citizens’ right to practice their religion generally as they please.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>
