Ozzy commands his subjects to jump but few take him up on the offer: again there’s that sense of just wanting to drink in history to its fullest, without the distractions of a moshpit.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6869b4ad8f0833eb8520f335" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-05T23:34:08.535Z">12.34am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Under an air raid siren, Geezer Butler is really tangible, playing dextrously under Iommi’s huge wall of noise … but then it’s Iommi’s show, playing <em>those</em> chords to open War Pigs. There’s no doubt that Ozzy is some degrees shakier here than on record, where his opening vocal is a like a column of flame. But the crowd buoy him up and join in to match the guitar line in a sound truly fitting of a football stadium.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6869b1ec8f089731c616cb11" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-05T23:25:55.205Z">12.25am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Black Sabbath begin</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>By this point, we know it’s only going to be a four-song set … but what songs.

He fixes his eyes straight on to Wylde’s quicksilver hands, cackling with delight.</p> <p>“I’ve been laid up for six years, and you’ve got no idea how I feel,” he says to the crowd. “Thank you from the bottom of my heart.” There is also gratitude for wife Sharon Osbourne and musical director Tom Morello. The pace dips and the phone torches are up for Mama, I’m Coming Home – which has a really valedictory feel to it.</p> <p>But the energy zooms back up for Crazy Train, and Ozzy is now in the finest voice he’s been all night.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-05T22:57:43.555Z">at 11.57pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6869a7ce8f08aadc85acf0b0" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-05T22:35:05.666Z">11.35pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>This livestream will be getting fed through a soundboard, and here, Ozzy’s voice is sounding better than some of the social media videos I was looking at before. “It’s so good to be on this fucking stage, you have no idea,” he says. “Have you had a good day today?

He delivers both his solo set and the Sabbath set from a throne, and at times he is clearly struggling to hit pitch. But he seems deeply moved by his reception, and the crowd carry him when he can’t hit the notes. It’s very emotional and one senses he – as well as the crowd – wish he could have been fit for longer sets. But what a joy to see the original Sabbath foursome – drummer Bill Ward stripped to the waist, alarmingly – if only for four songs. Paranoid ends, fireworks begin, and that’s your lot.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6869a0e28f0833eb8520f2d3" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-05T22:03:49.738Z">11.03pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Feel like this should come with a caption from Ronnie Wood that’s something like: “She is my rock!

The tour was going well, but then he caught pneumonia, twice. “And then I had an infection. I’m still on antibiotics to be honest with you, I had a thing put in the vein in my arm to feed in IV shots of them.” Six years later, “I’ve still got it on – it comes out this week, with a bit of luck. Antibiotics knock the hell out of you.”</p> <p>The European dates of the tour were postponed to give him time to recover. Then, in February 2019, “I went to the bathroom in the night, I didn’t put the light on. I thought I knew where the bed was. I was stupid, I dived and there weren’t a bed there. I landed straight on my face. I felt my neck go crunch. I went: ‘Sharon! Call an ambulance!’ She said, ‘Where the hell are you? Get into bed!’ I said: ‘Sharon, don’t ask questions.’ I thought I was going to be paralysed.”</p> <p>The fall had “pushed out of whack” existing damage to his neck vertebrae from a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/09/arts.artsnews">2003 quad bike accident</a>. In intensive care, he was told that if he didn’t have an operation, he would be left paraplegic, but the operation itself was, Ozzy says, “the worst fucking surgery you can imagine. I should have got a second opinion, but you think surgeons know what the fuck they’re doing.”</p> <p>Two metal plates were put in either side of his spine, but the screws became loose, creating bone fragments and lesions. “They haven’t figured out the damage, it’s so intricate,” Sharon says. Another surgeon was found, who slowly removed all the metal. “Five operations later, it just fucked his body. It was torturous for him: Parkinson’s and damage to his spine. It’s just been horrendous.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686990be8f089731c616ca7b" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-05T20:57:33.902Z">9.57pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Some approved pics are finally filtering down to the media, so here’s a selection from this afternoon.</p>       </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-05T21:03:49.539Z">at 10.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-686991638f08aadc85acf045" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-05T20:56:55.757Z">9.56pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Ricky Gervais posts a video message, paying tribute to Ozzy but saying his starkest memory is “from when we were on the Graham Norton show together and they had to stop the recording because we both needed a piss”.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686990058f08aadc85acf03c" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-05T20:53:02.435Z">9.53pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Guns N’ Roses close out with Paradise City, and its unrelenting maximalism does clobber me into a sort of dazed euphoria after a bit.

Minus Nuno and swap Lzzy for David Draiman for Shot in the Dark.” Both tunes from Ozzy’s 1986 album The Ultimate Sin.</p> <p>Supergroup B is going to be fronted by Van Halen hollerer Sammy Hagar. “I’m so honored,” Hagar said in a recent interview. “I chose to do No More Tears. And Tom [Morello] goes, ‘Oh, that would be great’ … And then he comes back and says, ‘Guess what. Ozzy’s gonna try and sing five songs, and he wants to sing No More Tears. I said, OK: Flying High Again.” He’s also going to sing one of his own numbers, Rock Candy by Montrose, “because it’s from the same era as Black Sabbath – Montrose and Sabbath were from the same kind of era. So, I’m excited.”</p> <p>Not massively well-known in the UK, Montrose were Hagar’s pre-VH band, whose self-titled 1973 debut was kind of doing what Led Zep were doing in the UK: forthright hard rock that would point the way towards a heavier, crunchier style later in the decade. Rock Candy is one of the slower, swaggering numbers – the kind of thing a roadside bar with a questionable alcohol licence would put on for “ladies’ night”.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-05T14:47:08.950Z">at 3.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68692c588f089731c616c6c6" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-05T13:51:53.087Z">2.51pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Hosting it all is Jason “Ahquarman” Momoa – “metal to the core”, according to Tom Morello.

I called Scott Ian, I called Kirk [Hammett], I called people basically begging to go. And then Ross Halfin, who’s the photographer of every goddamn band, he hit me up … I said I was trying to get a ticket, then he’s like, ‘Sharon wants you to host it!’ I’m like, ‘What the fuck are you talking about, man?!’ I’m over here begging for a ticket and now they want me to host it! I’ve never hosted anything before but I’ve gotta go out in front of all these fucking people and host! And now it’s on pay-per-view. Jesus Christ… I’ll be shitting my pants but at the same time it’s the goddamn greatest metal show in history.”</p> <p>Momoa is a very vocal metalhead, as this supercut demonstrates. His circle pit manners are excellent but as 2.24 shows, if you got in the way of Momoa mid-headbang you’d probably need helicoptering out of the venue. </p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8417kStRY0"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W8417kStRY0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-05T14:46:58.599Z">at 3.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68692b678f0833eb8520eec9" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-05T13:41:30.629Z">2.41pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Today’s livestream is on a two-hour delay, so us at home will experience everything later than Michael does in the stadium.
