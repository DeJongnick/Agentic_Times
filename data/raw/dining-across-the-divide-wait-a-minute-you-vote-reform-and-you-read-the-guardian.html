<p><strong>Michael, 35, Andover</strong></p>    <p><strong>Occupation </strong>Engineering manager</p> <p><strong>Voting record</strong> Generally a small-c conservative, has voted Tory in every election but 2024, when he voted Reform as a protest against the Conservative government. Doesn’t see himself voting Reform in 2029</p> <p><strong>Amuse bouche </strong>Buys individual pieces of Lego to make his own creations. For his 30th birthday, his fiancee bought him the makings of a 3ft wingspan Tiger&nbsp;Moth biplane</p> <p><strong>Bernard, 75, Salisbury</strong></p>    <p><strong>Occupation</strong><em> </em>Retired maths teacher</p> <p><strong>Voting record</strong> Labour or Lib Dem – whoever is most likely to beat the Tories</p> <p><strong>Amuse bouche</strong> Spent seven years teaching in Africa, first in Kenya, then in Malawi</p> <p><strong>For starters</strong></p> <p><strong>Bernard</strong> He was very young, very smartly dressed. I wasn’t scruffy, but I&nbsp;didn’t have his polish. A nice guy; a bit diffident to start with, but we both were, really. It’s a strange situation. Once we got talking, we got on fine.</p> <p><strong>Michael</strong> He seemed welcoming, more than warm.</p> <p><strong>Bernard</strong> I had buffalo chicken wings, followed by haddock, followed by a fantastic sticky toffee pudding. Perhaps I overdid it a bit.</p> <p><strong>Michael</strong> I had pork belly to start, and&nbsp;then a Portuguese beef stew.</p>    <p><strong>The big beef</strong></p> <p><strong>Bernard</strong> We both agreed that we had to&nbsp;get away from fossil fuels, but his solution is nuclear. If there is an accident, they tend to be disastrous accidents – he had all kinds of arguments for why Chornobyl couldn’t happen here, but even Sellafield in the early years, leaking radioactive water into the Irish Sea, was awful.</p> <p><strong>Michael</strong><strong> </strong>We should be pushing hard for&nbsp;nuclear, whereas Bernard leaned heavily into renewables. My reasons are the reliability of nuclear, the compactness. It’s unfair to judge nuclear on Chornobyl. The causes of that disaster were largely unqualified people and political interference, rather than science. It was the politicians running it, not the engineers.</p> <p><strong>Bernard</strong> The cost of Hinkley Point is immense. The French are building it, aren’t they? He thinks the reason why that’s happening is because the red tape in this country is so terrible. And what do you do with the waste? You bury it. But you’ve haven’t got rid of it, you’ve just left it for future generations.</p> <p><strong>Michael</strong><strong> </strong>My response to the half-life issue, which he raised, is that we take very diffuse radioactive material and concentrate it – so it’s not like we’re creating this deadly thing; it’s a natural element, or minerals rather, that’s been concentrated. So it’s a long problem but it’s not a big problem.</p>    <p><strong>Sharing plate</strong></p> <p><strong>Bernard</strong> I think Brexit is a done deal and I’m pretty sure that it won’t be reversed any time soon. Although I was furious about it, I do tend to think: what can we do? It’s like being really cross there was an earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Michael</strong><strong> </strong>We voted opposite ways but agreed that it was time to move on. It wouldn’t have happened this way were I dictator and in charge of everything, and I’m not particularly happy with the results, but we live in a democracy and you’ve got to accept compromise.</p>    <p><strong>For afters</strong></p> <p><strong>Bernard</strong><strong> </strong>We both felt there should be more consensus in politics. PMQs is a bit of a joke: it doesn’t mean anything – it’s like a tennis match. If you can make a select committee work, where people from all political parties manage to meet and agree on things, why can’t you make law like that?</p> <p><strong>Michael</strong><strong> </strong>Towards the end of the evening, he mentioned Wes Streeting’s new plan for the NHS. It’s nice that it’s a 10-year plan and is supported by the shadow health secretary. So that’s almost a glimmer of hope against the normal discourse of A says this and B says, “That’s bad because A said it.” If&nbsp;both sides say it’s a good thing, then&nbsp;it’s probably a good thing.</p>    <p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p> <p><strong>Bernard</strong> I certainly had an enjoyable evening. I don’t think I made a friend, in so far as he’s half my age. I said to him, “Wait a minute, you vote Reform, and you read the Guardian?” It turned out his fiancee is a teacher and she encouraged him to do it.</p> <p><strong>Michael</strong><strong> </strong>We walked out of the restaurant together, chatted as we walked down the street. We didn’t exchange numbers; I’ll never see him again, but I very much enjoyed talking to somebody I’d never normally have crossed paths with. I almost felt guilty about how much I enjoyed it.</p>    <p><em>Additional reporting: Kitty Drake</em></p> <p><em>• </em>Bernard and Michael ate at <a href="https://www.thechapterhouseuk.co.uk/">The Chapter House </a>in Salisbury</p> <p>Want to meet someone from across the divide? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/24/second-homes-big-tech-smoking-we-want-your-views-on-divisive-issues">Find out how to take part</a></p>
