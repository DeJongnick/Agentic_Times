<p>Good morning.</p> <p>The meeting was cordial, at times even warm, but the fracture lines in the transatlantic partnership were clear.</p> <p>Visiting the White House, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/trump-ukraine-putin-peacekeepers-macron">warned Donald Trump against a “surrender” of Ukraine</a>, as Trump said Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, “wants to make a deal” that could include European peacekeepers.</p> <p>Macron – the first European leader to visit after Trump’s re-election – disagreed over aid and efforts to secure a lasting peace in Ukraine. The meeting came hours after the US voted against a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/un-general-assembly-russia-ukraine-war">UN resolution</a> drafted by Ukraine and the EU condemning Russia for its invasion.</p> <p>Trump, who last week called Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a “dictator” and falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war, claimed to reporters that Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the conflict.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Here’s what Macron said:</strong> “This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine. It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Here’s what Trump said:</strong> “I believe that Emmanuel agrees with me on many of the most important issues. … Europe must take a central role in ensuring the long-term security of Ukraine.” Trump also said a US-Ukraine minerals deal was “very close”.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Personnel office walks back email ultimatum from Musk</strong></h2>    <p>The government’s human resources office <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/elon-musk-federal-workers-chaos">walked back</a> an ultimatum issued by Elon Musk that would have forced workers to email their recent accomplishments or resign, in signs of internal pushback to the world’s richest man’s campaign to downsize the federal workforce.</p> <p>The Saturday email, sent to millions of employees, provoked instant chaos across the government. Kash Patel, the new FBI director and a Trump loyalist, asked agents to “please pause any responses”.</p> <p>The AFGE labor union attacked Musk’s ultimatum to federal workers as an “unlawful distraction”.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>How are unions challenging Musk’s moves?</strong> Over the weekend, a coalition of groups opposed to the mass layoffs asked a court to prevent reprisals against employees who fail to reply by the deadline set at midnight on Monday. It’s “not just inappropriate – it is disruptive to essential government functions,” wrote AFGE’s president.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Germany’s likely new chancellor Friedrich Merz says it’s Europe’s ‘five to midnight’</strong></h2>    <p>The man expected to be Germany’s next chancellor said Europe must act swiftly to increase its defence capability given the US administration’s increasing adoption of the motto “America alone”.</p> <p>“This is really <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/germany-election-far-right-surge-friedrich-merz-warning">five minutes to midnight</a> for Europe,” Merz told reporters after his conservative alliance won 28.5% of Sunday’s vote.</p> <p>Merz said effective leadership was urgently needed to combat the far-right AfD’s rise. He also reiterated Germany’s support for Ukraine, despite Donald Trump’s apparent willingness to end the conflict in a way that favors Moscow over Kyiv.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What happens next?</strong> Merz, a 69-year-old former banker, is likely to try forming a government with Olaf Scholz’s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). The SPD, Germany’s oldest political party, had its worst ever result, with 16%. Scholz called the result “bitter”.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>In other news …</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p><strong>Pope Francis, in hospital with pneumonia and “mild” kidney failure, remains in a critical condition,</strong> although Vatican officials said here was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/pope-francis-slept-well-through-night-but-remains-in-critical-condition">“slight improvement”</a> yesterday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>About 7,000 people have died in fighting in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since January,</strong> said the DRC prime minister, amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/m23-militias-advance-in-eastern-drc-has-killed-7000-since-january-un-told">advances</a> from Rwanda-backed M23 rebels.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The soul icon Roberta Flack has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/feb/24/roberta-flack-soul-and-rb-icon-behind-killing-me-softly-dies-aged-88">died aged 88</a>. </strong>She was<strong> </strong>known for hits including Killing Me Softly With His Song.</p></li> <li><p><strong>An unfinished motorway bridge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/south-korea-bridge-collapse-anseong-video-footage">collapsed</a> in South Korea,</strong> killing at least three people.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Punching a man to the ground has landed a UK MP with a 10-week prison sentence.</strong> Labour lawmaker Mike Amesbury <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/24/suspended-labour-mp-mike-amesbury-sentenced-assault">drunkenly attacked</a> someone in the street.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A court upheld the Theranos founder’s</strong> <strong>conviction for defrauding investors, </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/24/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-conviction">rejecting</a> Elizabeth Holmes’s multi-year appeal.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Stat of the day:</strong> <strong>Chance of giant asteroid hitting Earth in 2032 falls to 0.0017%</strong></h2>    <p>After the odds of a future collision of Asteroid 2024 YR4 into Earth rose to 3.1% earlier this year, the likelihood of an impact has fallen to a negligible <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/feb/24/chance-giant-asteroid-hitting-earth-2032-falls">0.0017%</a>, Nasa says.
