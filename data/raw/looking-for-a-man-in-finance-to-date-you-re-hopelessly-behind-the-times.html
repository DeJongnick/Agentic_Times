<p><strong>Name:</strong> Hot doctors.</p> <p><strong>Age: </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> (c 460-370BC) is usually considered the father of medicine, but was he a hot doc? If you’re into baldy beardy men, often portrayed in marble, then yeah, why not?</p> <p><strong>Clever guy too</strong><strong> – he came up with one of my all-time favourite oaths. </strong>Or if you want to go back further still, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imhotep">Imhotep</a>, who lived around 2600BC in ancient Egypt, is sometimes regarded as the first recorded physician.</p> <p><strong>And “I’m hot” is literally part of his name.</strong> Though it’s hard to tell, going by the statues.</p> <p><strong>I’m guessing this isn’t all about</strong><strong> ancient medics, though?</strong> Correct. More about dating trends, and the careers considered sexiest in a potential partner.</p> <p><strong>“I’m looking for a man in finance, trust fund, 6</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>t 5in, blue eyes …”</strong> You’re referring to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@girl_on_couch/video/7363742421588512043?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404358%2C121497414%2C73319237%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C73347566%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121501435%3Bnull%3Bembed_masking&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=metro.co.uk%2F2025%2F01%2F27%2Fsingles-arent-looking-a-man-finance-this-sexiest-job-2025-22439366%2F&amp;referer_video_id=7364483352545529130">the riff uploaded to TikTok by @girl_on_couch</a>, which became something of a thing (60m views, remixes etc). But that’s so 2024.</p> <p><strong>And now Finance Bro’s been knocked off his perch by Dr Right? </strong>Well, first, this is not just about men. But otherwise, yes. A new study of 1,000 single men and 1,000 single women for the dating app The League found that healthcare is now considered the sexiest sector, top for 29% of respondents, with 26% specifically on the hunt for a doctor.</p> <p>People in scrubs, phwoar!“Careers in healthcare typically combine aspects of financial security, intelligence and caregiving – which are all very appealing qualities in a partner,” said The League’s dating expert, Rachel DeAlto.</p> <p><strong>Yeah, I’m thinking of George Clooney as Dr Ross in ER and Sandra Oh as Dr Yang in Grey’s Anatomy. </strong>It’s about caring, too, not just hot people in blue and green utility clothing.</p> <p><strong>And white coats! </strong><strong>Anyway, it’s good that care has replaced money. What about the finance bros?</strong> Kicked down the rankings; only 18% of women are looking for a man in finance, it turns out. Guess what’s second?</p> <p><strong>Journalist?</strong> Hahaha, doesn’t even feature. No, second is education.</p> <p><strong>The noblest vocation, building the future. We’ll </strong><strong>somehow have to make do on your teacher’s salary</strong><strong>.</strong> Third is emergency response workers.</p> <p><strong>O</strong><strong>oh, now you mention it, I don’t mind if you do carry me out of this burning building, give me the kiss of life</strong><strong> then drive me to hospital … </strong>It’s not just about your fantasies.</p> <p><strong>… w</strong><strong>here I might meet a hot doc</strong><strong>.</strong> Why don’t you ask about tech, it being 2025?</p> <p><strong>What about tech</strong><strong>? </strong>Down at seventh place, with just 17% willing to date in the sector.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Nope, Elon. Nope, Zuck, I’m swiping left!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “You look gorgeous in those scrubs, doctor.”</p>
