<p>If you want to demonstrate your fealty to Donald Trump through the medium of branded merchandise (and who doesn’t?) there are ample ways to do so. You can pick up a Trump bible and some of Melania’s lovely “<a href="https://www.melaniatrump.com/products/vote-freedom?variant=44273836261571">Vote Freedom</a>” jewellery. You can stay in one of his hotels, golf in his resorts, and get yourself a <a href="https://gettrumpwatches.com/?_ab=0&amp;_fd=0&amp;_sc=1&amp;srsltid=AfmBOorJR7xaNHWCyD_fivKWoJyZQl-jUr0DpnUryUdDiYvIvYsWGEi8">Trump watch</a>. You can buy some of the Trump-branded cryptocurrency that has made the family <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/trump-crypto-memecoin-corruption">extremely rich</a>. You can also, as announced on Monday, buy a gold Trump smartphone for just $499 and use <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/trump-organization-gold-phone">Trump mobile as your service provider</a> for $47.45. </p> <p>I know what you’re thinking. All this is wonderful, but where are the Trump-branded home goods? How can I demonstrate my loyalty to the president while cooking stew in my kitchen? Well, I have great news. Because capitalism is relentless, the Instant Pot brand is coming out with a Trump-inspired design. (Instant Pot, if you’re not familiar, is a pressure cooker that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/21/instant-pot-pressure-cooker-inspires-mass-devotion-join-cult-after-using-week">gained a cult-like</a> following several years ago, then went on a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/instant-pot-bankrupt-private-equity/674414/">downward spiral</a> when it was bought by a private equity firm.) The company is <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/trump-snowglobes-phone-socks-where-to-buy-08dnlptxc">apparently planning</a> various products emblazoned with “Make America Great Again”.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/06/16/2025/home-goods-companies-prepare-new-trump-linked-products">Semafor</a>, a portion of the profits of the Instant Pot collaboration will be donated to the “Trump Presidential Library”. At least two other home goods companies are also reportedly planning Trump-related releases, with profits being donated to Trump’s library. These include a tableware and collectible items company that has proposed plates with Trump’s face on them. Another company is thinking about a “Mar-a-Lago” and “White House” sheets collection. So you can really get into bed with the government.</p> <p>It doesn’t end here, does it? I imagine product development teams across the US are in brainstorming mode right now and we can look forward to more Trump-adjacent products with profits donated to Maga causes. Perhaps some enterprising confectionery company will come out with <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">ICE</a> cream: with every purchase going towards deporting an immigrant. Supplement companies could start selling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/14/the-red-pill-reddit-modern-misogyny-manosphere-men">red pills</a>. If Elon Musk gets back in Trump’s good books, perhaps we’ll get Musk-branded contraception: guaranteed to never work, to help his pro-natalist plans. And, considering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/29/trump-always-chickens-out-taco-investors-narrative">Trump’s purported nickname</a> (“Trump Always Chickens Out” or Taco), Taco Bell surely has scope to get in on the action.</p> <p>• Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist.</p>
