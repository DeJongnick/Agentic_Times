<h2>An Edinburgh institution</h2> 
<p><a href="https://www.armstrongsvintage.co.uk/">W</a> <a href="https://www.armstrongsvintage.co.uk/">Armstrong</a> in Edinburgh is a true institution. There are several locations, but the Grassmarket spot is a treasure trove. Frequented by locals, students and tourists alike, there is a price point for all. Whether I’ve been on the hunt for vintage cashmere, denim, fabulous 1950s dresses, garb for a fancy dress party or even a kilt, this store has sorted me out. It is always a favourite for when friends visit the city, and whether you are looking to buy or not, it is worth a visit just to see its eclectic collection.<br><strong>Amy</strong></p> 
<h2>Chic, thrifty shopping in Budapest</h2> 
<p>An Erasmus exchange took me to Budapest, where I discovered a city full of vintage shops and flea markets. The city is dotted with Humana shops for staple wardrobe finds; there’s the <a href="https://www.offbeatbudapest.com/places/ecseri-flea-market-langos-vendor/">Ecseri flea market </a>for the more unusual (interspersed with the occasional plastic Stalin bust); plus chic, rambling stores like <a href="https://szputnyikshop.com/">Szputnyik</a> and <a href="https://retrock.com/en/">Retrock Vintage</a> – think racks of leather jackets and tulle tops among giant monstera plants. Antiques shops are also found tucked away, their contents spilling on to the pavements outside. A particularly favourite find was a set of intricate hand-painted embroidery layouts on kraft paper from the 1930s, each signed by the artist.<br><strong>Katie</strong></p> 
<h2>Lyon’s canalside treasure trove</h2> 
<p>The <a href="https://thisislyon.fr/things-to-do/shopping/les-puces-du-canal/">Les Puces du Canal</a> flea market, in the Villeurbanne suburb on the Canal de Jonage, is a treasure trove for reasonably priced vintage clothes, 1960s paraphernalia and vintage furniture (much of the latter still falling in the sub-€150 category). Sunday is the day to go; get there early and have a glass of white wine and a few oysters while you admire your haul.<br><strong>Rebecca</strong></p>

<h2>Stockport is well stocked</h2> 
<p><a href="https://www.pearmillvintageemporium.co.uk/emporium_new/">Pear Mill Vintage Emporium</a> in Stockport, Greater Manchester, has a dizzying array of vintage and antique goods to browse, plus a cafe if you need a stop-off mid-shop. Prices are very reasonable and you can easily spend most of a day there. There’s even a hot yoga studio, climbing wall and pole-dancing classes in the same building if you want to throw some extra physical activity into your visit. Nearby Stockport town centre has lots of great indie restaurants, museums and shops to make a day of it.<br><strong>Lauren</strong></p> 
<h2>Being thrifty in Oslo</h2> 
<p>In Oslo, <a href="https://www.visitoslo.com/en/product/?tlp=5947803&amp;name=UFF-Second-Hand-Lokka">Uff </a>is a lovely chain of secondhand clothing stores. The price is cheap for Norway and it often has big sales and amazing high quality, unique, handpicked vintage items. There are several all over the city, but my favourite one is at Lille Grensen 2. You can get tops from about 100 Norwegian krone (£7.50).<br><strong>Sasha</strong></p> 
<h2>A Parisian haven of heritage clothing</h2> 
<p>I was browsing in an Oxfam bookstore in Paris’s 11th arrondissement when a flyer fell out of a book I’d picked up. It promised the best secondhand clothing place in the city and it was nearby on Rue Saint-Maur. I bought the book I’d been looking at and headed straight there. <a href="https://www.lafrangealenvers.fr/">La Frange à l’Envers</a> is a haven for pre-loved clothing: it has a huge range, of colours and sizes, everything is in fabulous condition and the sales team are the perfect Parisian mix of complimentary-yet-honest. <br><strong>Emily</strong></p> 
<h2>Bargains galore in southern Denmark</h2> 
<p>Danish charity shops are fab. Last summer in Vejle, while meeting up with family, I found some amazing bargains in charity shops: Georg Jensen candlesticks for £5; an amber necklace for one-fifth the price of the new ones in Skagen (£8); and a silver-plated Easter egg for £1. The shops are so well laid out, showing off Danish design. Simple, functional and so well made.<br><strong>Gabrielle Wyn</strong></p> 
<h2>Rummaging around in Prague</h2> 
<p>I really enjoyed Prague for its cheap, vintage secondhand shopping. I found an abundance of 1980s and 90s clothes, with lots of pop-up style shops to rummage around. I was there in June, and bought a fun shirt, and a pair of gorgeous hand-painted, Czech plates at <a href="https://www.restartshop.cz/">Restart Shop</a>. <a href="https://www.bellitex.cz/">Bellitex Fashion</a>, just south of Prague’s Old Town, also had a large, well-organised selection, and I was pleasantly surprised to find some other cool, vintage clothing shops in the same street. Perfect area to explore for an afternoon … and all at low prices.<br><strong>Tom</strong></p> 
<h2>Trondheim is a vintage dream</h2> 
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/arven_vintage/?hl=en">Arven Vintage</a> in the heart of Trondheim is a dream for anyone who loves clothes with a bit of history. The rails are packed with denim classics such as Levi’s, Lee and Wrangler, plus soft wool jumpers, blouses and beautifully made jackets. Everything’s from the 1990s or earlier, and the focus on natural fabrics like wool, linen and silk makes it feel special. I picked up a gorgeous Italian wool blazer there, and people always ask where it’s from. Arven has that rare mix of quality, character and charm that makes vintage shopping such a joy. The staff are lovely too – knowledgable and clearly passionate about what they do. A true gem for vintage lovers.<br><strong>Sabine</strong></p> 
<h2>Winning tip: rural French oasis of thrift shops</h2> 
<p>Lectoure, between Toulouse and Bordeaux in south-west France, is a little oasis of vintage shops and a fantastic, large <em>brocante</em> (flea market). Set in an old hospital, <a href="https://www.tourisme-gers.com/village-de-broc-antiquites-lectoure-131016">Village de Brocante Antiquitiés</a> is an atmospheric place, where the wards now spill out with furniture, household sculptures and objets d’art – plus things that will perplex and fascinate even the most picky of magpies. I came away with a stunning set of 1960s glasses that I kept safely wrapped in my handbag all the way home. <br><strong>Liz</strong></p>
