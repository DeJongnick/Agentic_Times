<p>Protesters rallied nationwide on Thursday in support of workers’ and immigrants’ rights in the latest round of demonstrations against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">administration</a>.</p> <p>May Day, commemorated as international workers’ day, comes after two massive days of protests in April – 5 April’s hands off rallies and 19 April’s day of action – drew millions to the streets across the country.</p> <p>The 1 May protests were supported by hundreds of organizations and set to take place in nearly 1,000 cities, organizers said, with a focus on rallying against the Trump administration and “billionaire profiteers”. Turnout was<strong> </strong>predicted to be lower than the previous two April protests because 1 May is a weekday, but tens of thousands were expected to turn out. Cities across the US from New York to Seattle to Anchorage, Alaska, saw major demonstrations.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/trump-100-days-protests-opposition">Trump 100 days: after tepid start, protest movements – and Democrats – find footing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This is a war on working people – and we will not stand down,” a <a href="https://maydaystrong.org/">website</a> for the national day of action says. “They’re defunding our schools, privatizing public services, attacking unions, and targeting immigrant families with fear and violence. Working people built this nation and we know how to take care of each other. We won’t back down – we will never stop fighting for our families and the rights and freedoms that propel opportunity and a better life for all Americans. Their time is up.”</p>    <p>A <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/mayday/">map</a> of May Day protests showed several major metro areas had more than one rally planned. A coalition of groups in Los Angeles started the day with an early morning rally, then a program and march to show solidarity with the city’s workers and immigrants. In New York, protests were planned throughout the day.</p> <p>Protesters turned out in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> to support workers, immigrants and others under attack by the Trump administration. Some of those attending the New York rally spoke against Columbia University’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/columbia-university-funding-trump-demands">capitulation</a> to Trump’s demands.</p> <p>“Today, we saw lots of new people who are getting energized and activated. The Trump administration is clearly coming for all of these rights that we’ve won, and all of us are taking up the task to fight back,” said Saidi Moseley, 25, an education coordinator and one of the organizers of the May Day march in Union Square.</p> <p>Betsy Waters held a sign saying “due process for all”. The 67-year-old retiree who volunteers full-time said she had come to several marches. “I feel that we have to be out here. We have to be out here making a stand as much as we can,” Waters said. “So I am out here making a stand, saying that what is happening in our country is just not right.”</p> <p>Lydia Howrilka, a 25-year-old librarian from Queens, was holding a “only you can stop fascism” sign. “I am standing in solidarity with my immigrant brothers and sisters in New York. I am standing in defense of democracy,” Howrilka said.</p> <p>Grant Miner, one of a handful of speakers at the New York rally, was <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/grant-miner-columbia-expelled-palestine/">abruptly expelled</a> by Columbia University in March for participating in pro-Palestinian protests. </p>    <p>“I’m trying to speak out about the things that are affecting my workers, which include the ongoing cuts to higher education, as well as the targeting of students for student protests, which are two very big issues facing our workplace reality,” said Miner, who also serves as president of UAW 2710, the Student Workers of Columbia union. </p> <p>As Trump surpassed 100 days in office, a period filled with slashing and burning of the federal government and democratic norms, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/trump-100-days-protests-opposition">resistance has taken shape</a>, growing in size since February. People have started to organize in larger numbers to pressure Democrats to stand up more strongly to Trump.</p> <p>Trump’s approval ratings have fallen from positive to negative, with more people disapproving of him than approving. The focus on workers and immigrants comes as Trump has fired a host of federal workers and his administration has ramped up deportations, including of people who the courts have said were not supposed to be deported.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/27/trump-protest-movement-50501">‘A trickle to a tidal wave’: behind the Trump protest movement that launched on Reddit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Everyone deserves respect and dignity, no matter who they are, where they were born, or what language they speak,” the May Day protest website says. “Immigrants are workers, and workers are immigrants. Our fight for fair wages, safe workplaces, and dignity on the job is the same fight for immigrant justice.”</p> <p>Organizers behind the May Day protest in Washington DC said they expected to see up to 3,000 people join the rally in the nation’s capital to demand safety on the job, legal protections and an end to unjust deportations.</p> <p>“We’re seeing people abducted off the streets every day in some of the most violent and cruel ways. We’re seeing people like Kilmar Ábrego García – and he’s only one story. His story is not unusual,” said Cathryn Jackson, the public policy director at Casa, a group that provides critical services to immigrant and working-class families.</p>    <p>Ábrego García’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, was expected to speak at Thursday’s rally as she continues to fight for her husband to be released from prison in El Salvador and to be returned to the US.</p> <p>“Hundreds and hundreds of people are being deported to some of the worst prisons across the country with no due process,” Jackson said. “This rally today is about solidarity. It’s about saying no matter what the Trump administration tries to do, we are determined to fight back.”</p> <p>Also among the speakers scheduled to address the Washington rally was María del Carmen Castellón, whose husband, Miguel Luna, died in the Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore last year.</p> <p>The story of Luna and the five other construction workers who died during the tragedy is “symbolic”, Jackson said. The six men were all construction workers originally from Latin American countries.</p> <p>“This is the story of men working in the middle of the night while all of us were sleeping, getting the roads together, doing the work that many people don’t want to do,” Jackson continued. “We are literally physically building this country, and then being treated the way we are in return.”</p> <p>Delia Ramirez, a Democratic representative of Illinois, addressed the crowd in Franklin Park as the “proud daughter of Guatemalan immigrants”.</p>    <p>“Today on International Workers’ Day, we are united,” Ramirez said. “We’re united because we understand that this president wants to silence us. He wants to divide us, pit us against each other. But we are not going to be silenced.”</p> <p>The Trump administration knows that “the only thing that will stop fascism is mobilization”, she continued, acknowledging that there will be “really hard days” ahead. “But as long as you keep organizing, I can amplify that voice and continue to stand up to fascism.”</p> <p>Jorge Mújica, the strategic organizer for Arise Chicago and an organizer of the city’s May Day protest, <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2025/4/29/trump_100_days">said on Democracy Now</a> that “the Trump administration miscalculated completely” by targeting so many constituencies in its first 100 days.</p> <p>“They are attacking everybody at the same time, and that [has] enabled us to gather a really broad coalition with labor unions, with federal workers, with students, with teachers at universities, and every other community and put together this event on May Day,” Mújica said. </p>
