<p>Millions of meals worth of wasted food could be redistributed thanks to an artificial intelligence tool being trialled by companies across the UK, including Nestlé.</p> <p>The AI tool, which has already generated an 87% reduction in edible food waste at one of the Swiss conglomerate’s factories over its first two-week trial period, is intended to “design out” food waste by providing real-time monitoring, tracking and insights of wasted ingredients and products.</p> <p>Under the pilot scheme, Nestlé said that up to 700 tonnes of quality <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/27/labour-backs-plans-for-15m-fund-to-distribute-surplus-food-from-farms">surplus food</a> – the equivalent of up to 1.5 million meals – could be saved. The trial is also estimated to prevent up to 1,400 tonnes of CO2 being emitted, helping to save up to £14m in running costs.</p> <p>Alina Sartogo, one of the co-founders of Zest, which developed the tool, said all the food waste it identified was edible, but not sellable at a profit for the manufacturers. For example, the waste might include a broken KitKat bar, or a product with an expiry date that’s too short to sell on to retailers.</p> <p>The Zest software could be expanded across the food supply chain on a subscription basis by March next year, following a series of pilots with different manufacturers.</p> <p>A second pilot with Nestlé has recently been launched after receiving funding from the government agency Innovate UK’s <a href="https://iuk-business-connect.org.uk/programme/bridgeai/">BridgeAI</a> scheme, which provides a £1.9m match-funded grant for AI projects.</p> <p>Esra Kasapoglu, director of AI and data economy at the agency, said the project represented a <strong>“</strong>solution that aims to transform food sourcing and distribution across the UK, cutting waste, reducing carbon emissions, and lowering costs”.</p> <p>About <a href="https://fareshare.org.uk/what-we-do/hunger-food-waste/#:~:text=By%20%E2%80%9Cfood%20industry%E2%80%9D%20we%20mean,according%20to%20their%20environmental%20impact.">4.6m tonnes</a> of edible food, equivalent to 10bn meals of food, is wasted in the UK each year.</p> <p>Simon Millard, director of food at the charity FareShare, said the technology would <strong>“</strong>make a huge difference” to its work to redistribute food to more than 8,000 charities and community groups across the UK.</p> <p>For the latest pilot, Sustainable Ventures, which supports climate startups, has brought together several companies, including Nestlé; the machine learning-based logistics system provider Bristol Superlight, Howard Tenens Logistics, the supply chain management system FuturePlus, FareShare, and Google Cloud’s BigQuery and Vertex AI platform.</p>
