<p>Donald Trump’s new tax bill will add $3.4tn to the national debt over the next decade, according to new <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61570">analysis</a> from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released Monday.</p> <p>Major cuts to Medicaid and the national food stamps program are estimated to save the country $1.1tn – only a chunk of the $4.5tn in lost revenue that will come from the bill’s tax cuts.</p> <p>The cuts will come through stricter work requirements and eligibility checks for both programs. The CBO estimates the bill will leave 10 million Americans without health insurance by 2034.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/07/trump-bill-us-national-debt">Trump bill set to add trillions to US debt pile – can America stop it climbing?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bill also makes permanent tax cuts that were first introduced by Republicans in Trump’s 2017 tax bill. The cuts included a reduction in the corporate tax rate, from 35% to 21%, and an increase to the standard deduction. It also includes a tax dedication for workers receiving tips and overtime pay, and removes tax credits that support wind and solar power development, which could ultimately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/trump-tax-bill-energy-republican-states">raise energy costs</a> for Americans.</p> <p>Increased costs will also come from boosts to immigration and border security funding. The bill <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-funding-big-beautiful-bill-trump-deportations/">allocates</a> nearly $170bn to immigration law enforcement, including the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency and funding for a wall along the southern border.</p> <p>The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget <a href="https://www.crfb.org/press-releases/final-obbba-score-confirms-long-road-fiscal-recovery">estimates</a> that, with interest, the bill will actually add $4.1tn to the deficit. The US <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/">national debt</a> currently stands at more than $36tn.</p> <p>“It’s still hard to believe that policymakers just added $4tn to the debt,” Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement. “Modelers from across the ideological spectrum universally agree that any sustained economic benefits are likely to be modest, or negative, and not one serious estimate claims this bill will improve our financial situation.”</p> <p>Trump signed the bill into law earlier this month after weeks of debate among congressional Republicans. The bill passed the Senate 51-50 before it passed the House 218-214.</p> <p>While Republicans largely celebrated the bill, with Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/04/trump-tax-and-spending-bill">calling it</a> “the most popular bill ever signed in the history of the country”, only a quarter of Americans in a CBS/YouGov <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-trump-deportation-program-prices/">poll</a> said that the bill will help their family.</p> <p>Democrats meanwhile universally criticized the bill, with Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/04/democrats-trump-bill">saying</a> that while “the GOP continues to cash their billionaire donors’ checks, their constituents will starve, lose critical medical care, lose their jobs – and yes, some will die as a result of this bill.”</p>
