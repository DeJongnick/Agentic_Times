<p>Senate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> shot down a Democratic-led attempt to fully fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits on Monday during the government shutdown – a move that heightens uncertainty for the 42 million Americans participating in the country’s biggest anti-hunger program.</p> <p>Jeff Merkley, a Democratic senator, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, attempted to pass a <a href="https://www.merkley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Merkley-Schumer-SNAP-Resolution.pdf">resolution</a> via unanimous consent that would have forced the Department of Agriculture to fund Snap benefits for the month of November.</p> <p>But Republican senators objected, with John Barrasso, Senate majority whip, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpeGgPad1oM">arguing</a> that a solution toward ensuring those benefits lies in reopening the government.</p> <p>“This isn’t lawmaking. It’s a political stunt by the Democrats. The resolution they’re offering is empty,” Barrasso said. “Democrats knew their actions threatened food assistance. They were fully aware of it.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions">Americans ‘dumbfounded by cruelty’ of Trump officials slashing Snap benefits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The move comes after the administration announced it will use money from an agriculture department contingency fund to restart Snap food benefits, but the money would only grant partial assistance. The administration said there’s only $4.65bn available in that fund to pay for Snap benefits, which would only cover about half of the $8bn in food assistance payments people receive every month.</p> <p>“Trump is using food as a weapon against children, families, and seniors to enact his ‘make Americans hungry agenda,’” said Merkley in a statement.</p> <p>“It’s unbelievably cruel, but Trump cares more about playing politics than making sure kids don’t starve. Kids and families are not poker chips or hostages. Trump must release the entirety of the Snap funds immediately.”</p> <p>The diminishing funds come as Senate Republican leaders continue their attempts to pass a bill to reopen the government, with 13 tries so far and a clear resolution nowhere in sight.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/01/food-banks-stock-resources-snap-lapse">Food banks and pantries across the country</a> are already struggling amid the cuts to federal programs, scrambling to meet the increased demand driven by federal workers who have gone unpaid during the shutdown.</p> <p>Should the shutdown continue past Tuesday, it will be the longest one in history. The previous record was set in 2019, during Trump’s first term, when he demanded that Congress give him the funds to erect a border wall between the US and Mexico.</p>
