<p>The deal to build Universal’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/apr/09/universal-chooses-bedford-to-be-location-of-its-first-theme-park-in-europe">new theme park in Bedford</a> was secured with a package of support that included £500m of public investment in rail and road infrastructure, it has emerged.</p> <p>Comcast, the parent company of Universal, is in negotiations over the final scale of the overall government assistance package, which could be expanded beyond infrastructure investment.</p> <p>The entertainment company, which had been considering a number of countries in which to build the park, announced in April that it would build the attraction on a 192-hectare (476-acre) site at the former Kempston Hardwick brickworks.</p> <p>The significant government offer of financial support for the project comes amid a push by Keir Starmer and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to kickstart sluggish economic growth.</p> <p>The approximately half a billion pounds in infrastructure spending comprises £270m in rail upgrades including a new station at Wixams, which had originally been planned more than 20 years ago, and about £200m for road works according to the Financial Times, which <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7f355b2a-9860-4721-8eef-3100f260acc5">first reported</a> the arrangement.</p> <p>Last year, Bedford borough council entered an agreement with Network Rail to construct a two-platform station at Wixams <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4nger6lk83o#:~:text=Council%20agrees%20%C2%A362m%20to%20fund%20new%20rail%20station&amp;text=However%2C%20if%20a%20Universal%20theme,Conservative%20councillor%20Graeme%20Coombes%20said.">at a cost of £62.6m</a>.</p> <p>However, local councillors said at the time that if the Universal theme park was approved it would need <a href="https://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/news/politics/council/wixams-railway-station-due-to-open-in-2026-as-cost-rises-by-ps30million-4673698">significantly more investment, with a much bigger four-platform station.</a></p> <p>The government has said the theme park, which is due to open in 2031, will bring a £50bn boost to Britain’s economy and create 20,000 jobs in construction, with a further 8,000 operational roles once it is up and running.</p> <p>About 8.5 million visitors are expected in its first year of operations, with Comcast estimating the UK will take in an additional £14.1bn in tax over 20 years from the site.</p> <p>In April, the government overruled planning inspectors and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/03/luton-airport-allowed-to-double-capacity-after-uk-government-overrules-planners">approved an almost doubling of capacity at Luton airport</a>, which is expected to be one of the main air hubs used by visitors to the park.</p> <p>Comcast’s plans are still to be scrutinised by the Planning Inspectorate, with a final decision made by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.</p> <p>Comcast, the Treasury, the Department for Transport and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment.</p>
