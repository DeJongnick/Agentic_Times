<p>As a retired civil servant, I read your article with interest (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/14/civil-service-is-too-remote-from-peoples-lives-across-uk-says-minister">Civil service is ‘too remote’ from people’s lives across UK, says minister, 14 June</a>).<strong> </strong>I am in favour of moving roles out of London, but simply moving locations is not enough without culture change.</p> <p>Civil servants come from a range of communities. Most are passionate about public service. But the hierarchy means that only those who are able and willing to play by unwritten rules (created by white, middle-class, non-disabled men for their own benefit) can climb the ladder; civil servants are encouraged to focus more on what will please senior leaders than on what will benefit communities; and the civil service often values grade and seniority over knowledge, experience and expertise.</p> <p>To provide the best public services the civil service needs to reflect, at all levels, the communities it serves. At present it doesn’t, and diversity diminishes with seniority. The “back-office function” of experienced equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) specialists is essential: to identify barriers to under-represented groups; to ensure a working environment where everyone can thrive; and to rewrite the hidden rules so that they work for everyone. Senior leaders (including ministers) need to value the experience and expertise of specialists at more junior grades.</p> <p>In 2008 I joined the Crown Prosecution Service as an equality, diversity and community engagement manager. As well as EDI issues, my role involved engaging with local communities to understand their needs and build confidence in the criminal justice system. Engaging with communities improves the service provided and encourages those from under-represented groups to consider joining the civil service. </p> <p>In this country, we have always referred to EDI. Those who advocate doing away with “DEI” betray their slavish Trump worship.<br><strong>Caroline Airs</strong><br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
