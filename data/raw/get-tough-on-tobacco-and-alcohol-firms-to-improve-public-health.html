<p>The “timid” approach by the government when it comes to regulating businesses is a shift from the promises of just a year ago to face down the nanny-state jibes to secure the long-term future of the NHS (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/09/the-guardian-view-on-public-health-if-labour-is-serious-about-reducing-illness-it-must-focus-on-causes">Editorial, 9 September</a>). This approach is also at odds with public sentiment. <a href="https://ash.org.uk/media-centre/news/press-releases/demand-for-action-on-uks-top-three-killers-ahead-of-governments-10-year-health-plan">Recent polling showed</a> 74% of people want the government to prioritise people’s health over business growth.</p> <p>With millions of people affected by preventable diseases caused by tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy food, we need stronger action from the government to match the rhetoric – including minimum unit pricing to prevent strong alcohol being sold cheaply, a levy on the profits of the tobacco industry and the implementation of mandatory policies to improve food and drink.</p> <p>This will not just benefit the NHS but support the government’s growth ambition, given the heavy toll of poor health on productivity and the wider economy.<br><strong>Hazel Cheeseman</strong><em> Chief executive, Action on Smoking and Health; </em><strong>Prof Sir Ian Gilmore</strong> <em>Chair, Alcohol Health Alliance; </em><strong>Katharine Jenner</strong><em> Director, Obesity Health Alliance</em></p> <p>• The government’s ambition to shift to prevention is something many have tried but not achieved. There is cross-party consensus, backed by public support, that we should rid our country of the tobacco epidemic and end smoking, a <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7648/">leading cause of preventable death</a>. The <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3879">tobacco and vapes bill</a> is the chance to do this, but isn’t being prioritised in parliament.</p> <p>As long as tobacco firms can profit, they will attempt to delay and weaken regulations that save lives. A levy on them would weaken this incentive while raising <a href="https://ash.org.uk/media-centre/news/press-releases/big-tobacco-must-pay-new-report-demands-urgent-action-from-mps-to-end-smoking-within-a-generation">£700m</a> per year, which could fund efforts to improve public health. Companies built on profits from addiction and disease should be nowhere near policymaking. It is only right that they pay for the damage they cause.<br><strong>Mary Foy </strong><br><em>Co-chair, all-party parliamentary group on smoking and health</em></p> <p><em><strong>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
