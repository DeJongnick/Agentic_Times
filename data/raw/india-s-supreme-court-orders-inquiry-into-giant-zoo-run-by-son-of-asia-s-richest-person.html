<p>India’s supreme court has ordered an investigation into a vast private zoo founded by the son of Asia’s richest person over allegations of illegal wildlife imports and financial misconduct.</p> <p>Home to a reported 200 lions, 250 leopards and 900 crocodiles, Vantara in western Gujarat state describes itself as the “world’s biggest wild animal rescue centre”. It is run by Anant Ambani, a son of Mukesh Ambani, the billionaire head of the conglomerate Reliance Industries, and was one of the venues for his extravagant wedding celebrations last year, where celebrities were encouraged to wear “jungle fever” outfits.</p> <p>Despite a visit from Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, who <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGyFM8jq-va/?hl=en">praised the operation</a> as “truly commendable”, the 3,000-acre site is not open to the public and has faced intense criticism from wildlife activists over how more than <a href="https://vantara-zoo.com/how-many-animals-are-there-in-vantara-zoo/">150,000 animals</a> at the site area are treated.</p> <p>The facility, which Vantara says is intended to provided “lifelong care for animals that cannot be reintroduced into the wild”, is situated on baking flatlands next to a giant oil refinery complex owned by the Ambani family.</p> <p>In March, a <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/indien-vantara-riesenzoo-wildtierhandel-loewen-e470491/?reduced=true">joint investigation</a> by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Venezuelan investigative media outlet Armando Info<em> </em>found at least 39,000 wild animals had been delivered to the facility.</p> <p>On Monday, India’s supreme court said it had ordered a panel led by retired judges to investigate alleged unlawful acquisition of animals, particularly elephants, other violations of wildlife regulations and money laundering. They must submit their report by 12 September.</p> <p>“We consider it appropriate … to call for an independent factual appraisal,” the court said. It added that the team would also assess whether Gujarat’s harsh climate was unsuitable for the animals, and “complaints regarding creation of a vanity or private collection”.</p> <p>The court said it issued the order after petitions based on media reports and complaints by wildlife organisations.</p>    <p>Vantara said in a statement on Tuesday that it would extend “full cooperation” to the investigation team and “remains committed to transparency, compassion and full compliance with the law”.</p> <p>“Our mission and focus continues to be the rescue, rehabilitation and care of animals,” it said.</p> <p>Over the last year, Vantara has featured heavily on the YouTube channel of the US wildlife influencer Forrest Galante, showcasing facilities such as an elephant jacuzzi and the world’s largest leopard rescue centre.</p> <p>But the investigation by Süddeutsche Zeitung and Armando Info, which looked at import data for thousands of wildlife, raised concerns about the origins of some of the animals. They reported that a mountain gorilla – which typically lives in a family group – and 14 orangutans were among more than 11,000 animals moved to the facilities from the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p> <p>More than 100 giant otters and 142 giant anteaters were brought from Venezuela, while 481 green tree pythons and 520 hawk doves were brought in from Malaysia and Indonesia respectively, according to the report. Vantara did not respond to their reporting.</p> <p>The zoo was among the many venues for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/12/ambani-wedding-india-anant-radhika-merchant-mumbai-guests">Anant Ambani’s lavish multi-day wedding celebrations in 2024</a>, which set a new benchmark in matrimonial extravagance with private performances by the pop stars Rihanna, Justin Bieber and Katy Perry.</p> <p>Vantara is thought to be unique in its size and ambition, dwarfing other private animal collections. The Wilds in Ohio is larger, covering more than 10,000 acres on a former coalmine, but has far fewer animals.</p> <p>Mukesh Ambani, Anant’s father, is worth $100bn, putting him in the world’s top 20 richest people. He made much of his money in petrochemicals and is also the owner of the toy shop chain Hamleys.</p>
