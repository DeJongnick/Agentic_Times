<p>For decades, the Kardashian-Jenner clan have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/14/kim-kardashian-accused-of-doing-permanent-damage-to-marilyn-monroe-dress">pushed</a> the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/20/young-people-skincare-gen-z-ageing-fixation">boundaries</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/27/corset-regrettable-return-mothercare-waist-training">onerous</a> beauty standards. Recently, the group’s matriarch, Kris Jenner, set the internet aflutter when she emerged at Lauren Sánchez’s Paris bachelorette party in May looking … different.</p> <p>Outlets including <a href="https://people.com/kris-jenner-plastic-surgeon-revealed-amid-speculation-about-her-shocking-new-look-11740882">People</a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/06/04/kris-jenner-lindsay-lohan-celebrities-surgery-rumors/83942816007/">USA Today</a> and <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/longevity-movement-facelift">Vogue</a> posted urgent bulletins about the almost-septuagenarian’s smooth, taut face. “The 69-year-old ...] has recently been mistaken by fans for her supermodel daughter, Kendall Jenner, 29,” wrote <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/05/22/style/the-plastic-surgeon-behind-kris-jenners-youthful-new-look/">Page Six</a>.</p> <p>Many speculated that Jenner’s new look was the result of a procedure known as a deep plane facelift. There has been <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/kris-jenner-smas-facelift">debate</a> about whether this is true; nevertheless, Google searches for the term soared.</p> <p>“Let’s be honest – if someone looks incredible for their age, they’ve likely had a facelift,” says Dr Akshay <a href="https://drsanan.com/">Sanan</a>, a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon. “The truth is, there’s no green juice, workout regimen or amount of Botox and filler that can replicate the results of deep plane surgery,” Sanan says.</p> <p>Here’s what to know about the deep plane facelift.</p> <h2><strong>What is a facelift?</strong></h2> <p>The goal of any facelift – also known as a rhytidectomy – is to “lift and reposition the skin, soft tissue, fat pads and muscle layers that naturally descend over time due to gravity and ageing”, says Sanan.</p> <p>Specifically, it targets signs of ageing in the mid-face, jawline and neck, explains Dr Patrick J Byrne, facial plastic surgeon, president of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS) and chair of the Cleveland Clinic’s Head &amp; Neck Institute.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Facelifts are one of the most <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/cosmetic-plastic-surgery-overview">popular</a> cosmetic <a href="https://www.plasticsurgery.org/documents/news/statistics/2023/plastic-surgery-statistics-report-2023.pdf">procedures</a> in the US. According to a 2024 members <a href="https://www.aafprs.org/Media/Press_Releases/2024_Annual_Trends_Survey.aspx">survey</a> from the AAFPRS, the procedure is one of the three most common top facial surgery procedures, and nearly 90% of the group’s members perform them each year. The survey also noted that facelift patients are “trending younger” – roughly 32% of facelifts are performed on those ages 33-55, up from 26%.</p> <p>Facelifts are also becoming more common in the UK. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons <a href="https://baaps.org.uk/about/news/1891/cosmetic_surgery_trends_2024_facial_rejuvenation_surges_while_mens_procedures_decline/">reported</a> an 8% increase in the number of face and neck lifts performed in 2024, partly due to a 26% increase in the number of the procedures performed on men.</p> <h2><strong>How is a deep plane face</strong><strong>lift different from a traditional one?</strong></h2> <p>A deep plane facelift works with deeper layers of tissue than a typical facelift, also known as a superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) facelift. The SMAS is a thin, fibrous layer that divides the face’s deep and superficial layers of adipose tissue (or fat cells).</p> <p>“With a traditional SMAS facelift, the skin is lifted away from the underlying SMAS layer and tightened separately from it,” explains <a href="https://www.instagram.com/drjustincohen/?hl=en">Dr Justin Cohen</a>, a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon. This technique is “relatively easy to perform, and remains one of the most commonly used by surgeons today”, he says.</p> <p>By contrast, a deep plane facelift works beneath the SMAS layer, says Sanan. During a deep plane facelift, a surgeon releases the facial ligaments that “tether the face and neck down”. Releasing these ligaments allows the surgeon to “lift the entire facial soft tissue layer as a single unit,” he says.</p> <p>“The technique avoids the overly tight or ‘pulled’ look sometimes seen with more traditional techniques,” says Cohen.</p> <p>Because they work with a deeper layer of tissue, deep plane facelifts tend to last longer.</p> <p>“The face will continue to age following surgery,” says Cohen, and the longevity of the results depends on a number of factors including the patient’s genetics, lifestyle and skincare regimen. Generally, though, results can be seen for 10-15 years following surgery, as opposed to <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/facelift-frequently-asked-questions">up to 10 years</a> for regular facelifts.</p> <p>As it is a more complex procedure, the deep plane facelift often costs more than an SMAS facelift, says Cohen. The <a href="https://www.plasticsurgery.org/cosmetic-procedures/facelift/cost">American Society of Plastic Surgeons</a> puts the average cost of a facelift in the US at about $11,395. A deep plane facelift, meanwhile, can set you back between $30,000 and $100,000, says Cohen.</p> <p>“There are some high-demand surgeons charging up to $250,000 or more,” he says.</p> <h2><strong>What are the risks of a deep plane facelift?</strong></h2> <p>Every surgery comes with risks, and the risks of a deep plane facelift are similar to the risks of any facelift, says Cohen. These include hematomas (a collection of blood inside a closed wound), infection, nerve injury, a prolonged healing process, and facial asymmetries or irregularities.</p> <p>“In experienced hands, these risks are low but should be part of an informed discussion,” says Byrne.</p> <p>For people interested in a facelift, experts repeatedly emphasized how important it is to choose a skilled surgeon, especially when it comes to an advanced procedure like the deep plane facelift.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/22/men-plastic-surgery">My father had plastic surgery. Now he wants me and my mother to get work done</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Unfortunately, with the growing popularity of the term ‘deep plane’ as a marketing buzzword, there are surgeons advertising deep plane procedures” when that’s not what they’re doing, says Cohen.</p> <p>Experts recommend working specifically with a facial plastic surgeon – “someone who has dedicated their entire career to mastering facial anatomy, harmony and ageing”, says Sanan.</p> <p>Additionally, just because a deep plane facelift is the buzzy procedure <em>du jour</em> doesn’t mean you need one. Even if you are interested in cosmetic surgery, it might not be the procedure for you.</p> <p>“No single technique is right for everyone,” says Cohen.</p> <p>And if it’s not for you, just think of all the other things you could spend that money on – like a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1787539663/extremely-rare-collectors-item-valentina">rare Beanie Baby</a>, or several diamond crystal <a href="https://www.poshpuppyboutique.com/products/diamond-crystal-dog-bathtub-many-colors?variant=36120613683368&amp;utm_source=stry&amp;utm_medium=trafb&amp;utm_campaign=storeya60&amp;utm_term=&amp;gad_source=1">bathtubs for your dogs</a>.</p>
