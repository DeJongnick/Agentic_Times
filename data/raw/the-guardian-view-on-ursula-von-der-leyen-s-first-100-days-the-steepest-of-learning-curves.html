<h1>The Guardian view on Ursula von der Leyen’s first 100 days: the steepest of learning curves</h1>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/09/eu-defence-funding-ursula-von-der-leyen-trump">press conference</a> on Sunday to mark 100 days since the beginning of her second term as European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen erred on the side of understatement when asked whether she still considered the US to be an ally. The answer was yes, she replied, before adding that “we have our discussion points without question”.</p> <p>Hard to argue with that. Regarding the war in Ukraine, international <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/09/eu-must-brace-for-impact-of-trump-wrecking-ball-on-global-trading-system">trade</a> and existential questions concerning the future of European defence and security, the geopolitical landscape bears no resemblance to the one that Ms von der Leyen looked out upon on 1 December. As Mr Trump and his “America first” outriders have confounded cherished assumptions about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/09/after-80-years-of-transatlantic-ties-europe-forges-a-new-alliance">transatlantic alliance</a>, they have also sought to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/jd-vance-alice-weidel-meeting-germany-far-right">encourage</a> authoritarian nationalism in EU member states.</p> <p>In France and Germany, the fabled engine of European integration, this has been uncomfortably akin to knocking at an open door. In Paris, days after Ms von der Leyen reassumed office, Michel Barnier’s shortlived government <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxz934p56qo">collapsed</a> when Marine Le Pen pulled the rug from under it. In Germany, well before Elon Musk and JD Vance championed its cause, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party had reached historically high levels of support that would see it finish comfortably <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/23/conservatives-poised-to-win-german-election-but-far-right-afd-doubles-support">second</a> in February’s snap German election.</p> <p>As Ms von der Leyen put it on Sunday: “Our European values, democracy, freedom, the rule of law are under threat.” The response, from Brussels and in national capitals, needs to be both robust and more expeditious than is often the case in the labyrinthine world of EU policymaking. Happily, the initial signs are positive.</p> <p>The move last week by EU leaders to disapply the bloc’s fiscal rules to military spending, potentially freeing up £670bn, is a significant step towards achieving greater strategic autonomy from Washington. It followed the unveiling of extraordinarily radical proposals in the same week by Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich&nbsp;Merz. Bypassing a constitutional <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/what-is-germanys-debt-brake/a-67587332">restriction</a> on state borrowing, these are designed to facilitate not only far greater spending on defence, but also on the modernisation of a stagnating economy.</p> <p>After decades in which EU economic policy has been skewed by Berlin’s traditional debt aversion – shared with other <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/eu-summit-obstructionism-by-the-frugals-is-a-lose-lose-for-everybody-1.4308735">“frugal”</a> member states such as the Netherlands and Denmark – this is a very <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/23/conservatives-poised-to-win-german-election-but-far-right-afd-doubles-support">different</a> direction of travel. As Europe exits an era defined by an uncritical commitment to free trade and dependency on the US security umbrella, it is also the right one. Recognising the desire of many member states to formalise common borrowing arrangements introduced following Covid, Ms&nbsp;von&nbsp;der&nbsp;Leyen said “nothing is off the table” in relation to defence. But, as the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/draghi-report_en">Draghi report</a> argued last autumn, the same kind of fiscal firepower is required to meet the challenge of the green transition and compete with the US and China for the jobs and future industries of the 21st century.</p> <p>Last month in Brussels, a different kind of centenary was marked when a <a href="https://cor.europa.eu/en/news/tribute-jacques-delors-bust-unveiled-cor-and-eesc">bust</a> of a former commission president, Jacques Delors, was unveiled. Born in 1925, Mr Delors became the preeminent <a href="https://www.cer.eu/insights/delors-sch%C3%A4uble-and-europes-misdiagnosed-competitiveness-problem">champion</a> of a “social” vision, in which common EU institutions would deploy pooled resources in order to build a Europe where solidarity and growth were intertwined. That perspective faded from view following the neoliberal turn in the 1980s. As Ms&nbsp;von&nbsp;der Leyen navigates the rest of her five-year term, its time has come again.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
