<p>Less than 10% of the plastic produced around the world is made from recycled material, according to the first detailed global analysis of its life cycle.</p> <p>The research reveals that most plastic is made from fossil fuels, predominantly coal and oil, despite rhetoric by producers, supermarkets and drinks companies about plastic being recycled.</p> <p>The research analysed the 400m tonnes of plastic produced in 2022 in order to support attempts to reduce pollution and promote sustainable plastic management.</p> <p>Plastic production has risen markedly since the 2m tonnes manufactured in 1950, and is projected to reach 800m tonnes a year by 2050. “As a result plastic pollution is a pressing and growing global issue, posing major challenges for the environment, economy, and public health,” the authors said.</p> <p>Quanyin Tan and colleagues analysed key trends in the global plastic supply chain. Of the 400m tonnes of plastic produced over the course of 2022, just under 38m tonnes (9.5%) was produced from recycled plastic, 98% of the remaining 362m tonnes was produced from fossil fuels, predominantly coal and oil.</p> <p>The research, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02169-5">published in Communications Earth &amp; Environment</a>, shows a significant increase in the amount of plastic being disposed of by incineration rather than recycling, with just 27.9% of plastic waste disposed of in 2022 actually being recycled.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/04/plasticwaste-zip/giv-32554BHF2Hvce7ARf" data-alt="Graphic of plastic waste generated by country, and methods of disposal"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/04/plasticwaste-zip/giv-32554BHF2Hvce7ARf">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>While China is the biggest producer and consumer of plastic, Americans consume the most plastic per head, the equivalent of 216kg per person a year. The US produces 40.1 megatonnes (Mt) of plastic waste – most of it from plastic packaging.</p> <p>The 28 countries of the EU and Japan also register high per capita plastic consumption, at 86.6kg and 129kg respectively.</p> <p>Globally, landfill remains the main destination of plastic waste, accounting for 103.37 Mt or 40%.</p> <p>Attempts continue to agree a global plastic waste treaty to tackle the environmental and public health scourge of plastic waste.</p> <p>Talks in Busan, South Korea, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/01/international-talks-on-curbing-plastic-pollution-fail-to-reach-agreement-busan">ended in failure</a> last December after fossil fuel producing nations, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, resisted attempts to include production caps in the treaty.</p> <p>More than 100 countries supported a draft text that included legally binding global reductions in plastic production and the phasing out of certain chemicals and single-use plastic products.</p> <p>Talks are due to resume in Geneva in August.</p>
