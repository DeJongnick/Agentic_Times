He said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>How do you constantly manage a web of never-ending movements, day and night? It’s 24/7, all weekends, no time off. AI in the middle of our operations has been a significant step forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>The budget airline, which is headquartered in Hungary and listed on the London Stock Exchange, carries tens of millions of passengers every year. It operates short-haul flights from nine UK airports including London Gatwick, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Luton.<br><br>However, it has ranked among the lowest scores for customer satisfaction for short-haul economy airlines. This year the consumer group Which? found it had an overall customer score of 51%, just above <strong>Ryanair</strong> in bottom place at 49%. <br><br>The airline said it was using AI to help improve its customer service, as well as hiring more English-speaking call centre agents. Its new chatbot, Amelia, is also taking thousands of calls in a matter of hours, in what would normally take human agents “weeks”, the airline said. <br><br>Delehant said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The way we look at AI is not about replacing jobs. I know there’s a lot of fear across many industries that AI is going to replace us. You shouldn’t look at it this way: I think what AI’s opportunity really is right now is to make us more bionic.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wizz Air will also be testing a business class-style booking in December, which allows a passenger to block the middle seat so they can have more room. Delehant said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There will be no big seat or anything like that…But a bit more space by blocking the middle seats...There are so many low cost business travellers. They own their own businesses, they don’t want to spend first class prices or business class...but they’d like a little more space.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6900c3e68f0834dc8678f9f5" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-28T13:36:13.605Z">1.36pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Pimco sells down debt position in Thames Water, Sky reports</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The bond fund manager <strong>Pimco</strong> has reportedly sold most of its debt position in <strong>Thames Water</strong> as the crisis-hit water company edges closer to a private sector rescue deal, aimed at staving off temporary nationalisation. </p> <p><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/bond-giant-pimco-sells-bulk-of-thames-water-debt-position-13459195">Sky News reported</a> that Pimco, run by the former Man Group boss <strong>Emmanuel Roman</strong>, has in recent weeks reduced its exposure to Thames Water’s mountain of debt by selling hundreds of millions of pounds of debt – the majority of its holdings – to fellow investors including <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>, <strong>Elliott Advisors</strong> and <strong>Silver Point Capital</strong>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, it emerged that Thames Water may not fully comply with rules on pollution of England’s waterways for as long as 15 years, according to a new plan by creditors who are scrambling to avoid the utility being forced into government administration.</p> <p>The group of financial institutions, under the new London &amp; Valley Water holding company, has been locked in talks with Ofwat since May over acceptable terms for the hugely complex restructuring of Britain’s biggest water company.</p> <p>Thames Water has been crippled by huge debts built up over two decades by owners who have been criticised for paying out dividends without investing enough in its leaking pipes and malfunctioning treatment works, leading to repeated sewage spills into Britain’s rivers and seas, and fines from the regulator.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/02/thames-water-lenders-submit-new-rescue-plan-to-stave-off-collapse">Thames Water creditors ask for up to 15 years’ leniency from river pollution rules</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6900c2b88f08bf0dff18210d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-28T13:21:17.445Z">1.21pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Ben &amp; Jerry’s owner stopped brand developing flavour for peace in Gaza</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The co-founder of <strong>Ben &amp; Jerry’s</strong> has accused its owner of being part of a movement of “corporate butt kissing” of <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a></strong> and says management blocked the ice-cream brand from producing a flavour in support of peace in Gaza.</p> <p><strong>Ben Cohen</strong> told the Guardian that <strong>Unilever</strong> was pursuing a “corporate attack on free speech” by blocking the development of a special flavour in solidarity with the Palestinian people.

That’s very important.</p> </blockquote> <p>The estimated impact is based on calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank, first reported in the Financial Times, which has said that each 0.1-percentage-point downgrade to productivity would increase public sector net borrowing by £7bn in 2029-30. That suggests that a 0.3-point reduction could result in a £21bn hit to the public finances.</p> <p>Some analysts had been forecasting a 0.1 to 0.2-point downgrade in the OBR’s productivity outlook, resulting in smaller hit to the public finances of between £7bn and £14bn, based on IFS calculations. This would result in a total fiscal hole of £20bn to £30bn, according to some estimates.</p> <p>A larger downgrade to productivity by the OBR would increase that shortfall.
