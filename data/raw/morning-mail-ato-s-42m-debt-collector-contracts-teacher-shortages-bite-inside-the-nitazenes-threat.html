<p>Good morning. Today we reveal the scale of the contracts given by the Australian Taxation Office to Recoveriescorp, a measure of the ATO’s increasing reliance on the private debt collector.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, staff shortages are cutting deep in schools across Australia: we take a look at where the need is being most keenly felt.</p>

<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>An increasing number of fatal drug overdoses are being caused by nitazenes, which in some forms are 500 times stronger than heroin and 10 times stronger than fentanyl. Nitazenes are commonly found on the black market in Australia: in vapes sold as containing cannabis, in pills shaped as teddy bears supposed to be MDMA, in powder trafficked as cocaine, in counterfeit pain medication. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/03/nitazenes-synthetic-opioid-drug-500-times-stronger-than-heroin-fatal">What can be done</a>?</p>
