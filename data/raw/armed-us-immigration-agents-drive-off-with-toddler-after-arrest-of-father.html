<p>Masked, heavily armed federal immigration agents arrested a US citizen in the parking lot of a Los Angeles Home Depot store, then entered his car and drove away with his toddler, who is also a US citizen, in the backseat.</p> <p>The child’s grandmother said the incident had left the whole family shaken. “I am devastated by what has happened to my son and demand an explanation,” she said at a press conference on Wednesday.</p> <p>The 32-year-old father was picked up during a major enforcement operation at the Home Depot in LA’s Cypress Park neighborhood on Tuesday morning. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), five undocumented immigrants were also arrested.</p> <p>Later that morning, Maria Avalos, the 32-year-old’s mother, got a call from an unidentified number. It was agents with the US border patrol, asking her to come pick up her one-year-old granddaughter. “We didn’t know what happened to her while she was in their care, and they wouldn’t give us information about when my son would be released or where he was,” Avalos said at a press conference on Wednesday.</p> <p>Avalos said she still had not been able to speak to her son to find out where he is being held. The incident was captured on video and first <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-04/ice-border-patrol-dodger-stadium-parking-lot">reported</a> by the Los Angeles Times.</p> <p>Avalos said she had to wait for hours at an immigration office in downtown Los Angeles to take custody of her granddaughter, and was made to provide a birth certificate. “My granddaughter didn’t even know what was happening. She’s too small. She didn’t know what was happening to her father,” she said.</p> <p>The DHS has alleged that the 32-year-old “exited his vehicle wielding a hammer and threw rocks at law enforcement while he had a child in his car”. The agency did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about why agents drove away with the child rather than wait for another family member to come pick her up from the parking lot.</p> <p>The agency added: “He was arrested for assault and during his arrest a pistol was found in his car, that is reported stolen out of the state of New York. The individual has an active warrant for property damage.”</p> <p>Avalos did not comment on the agency’s accusations, and said that the family was searching for a lawyer to represent her son. She believes he was targeted because of the color of his skin, she said.</p> <p>It frightened her, she added, to later see <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQr8VcjkuYl/">videos</a> from bystanders who had recorded her son’s arrest. In a video reviewed by the Guardian, bystanders are heard yelling in alarm as several heavily armed agents seize the father, and then enter his car and drive away. The agent in the passenger seat is holding a gun in his hands.</p> <p>At one moment, the father drops his weight to the ground, but masked agents pull him up and continue escorting him away from his daughter.</p> <p>“I was sad to see my son throw himself on the floor to stop them from taking his daughter,’ she said. “He was protecting his daughter.” She was also alarmed to see masked agents, who were heavily armed, drive away with her granddaughter. “This is something very, very frightening, because it’s not clear who these people are,” she said.</p> <p>Immigrants’ advocates have raised alarm about the incident, which is one of several cases where agents have arrested parents or guardians in front of their children. This summer, officials in Waltham, Massachusetts, confirmed that a 13-year-old was abandoned on the street after an immigration raid. In southern California, a 19-year-old and a minor child were left behind after their father was arrested at a gas station.</p> <p>“Surely there is a better way of enforcing their policies in a way that does not separate families or place tender-aged children like this child in questionable circumstances,” said Renee Garcia, the communications director at the legal aid non-profit ImmDef. “I think that it’s absolutely traumatizing for a child to be placed in that situation.”</p> <p>“This is insane, what we are witnessing in this country,” said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, the communications director of Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (Chirla), an advocacy organization. “This should not be happening.”</p> <p>Avalos said she was hoping her son will be able to return home soon. “My son is a good, quiet, hard-working person. He works in the restaurant industry and just got his new job. And his family is everything to him,” she said.</p> <p>“He is the best dad. And his little girl follows him wherever he goes. She is safe now, though. She needs her father. And I need my son back.”</p>
