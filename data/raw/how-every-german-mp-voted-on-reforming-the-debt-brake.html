<h2>Vote to reform the debt brake</h2> 
<blockquote class="quoted"> 
 <p>A motion put before the outgoing Bundestag to alter the German constitution to allow for greater investment and borrowing, in part to fund higher defence spending. The vote needs a two-thirds majority to pass.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Note: this is the official vote count as released by the Bundestag – the president on the chamber floor earlier today gave the count as 513 yes to 207 no.</p>
