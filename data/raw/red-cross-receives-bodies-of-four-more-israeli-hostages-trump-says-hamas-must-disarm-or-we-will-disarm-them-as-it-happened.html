 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Hamas handed over four more bodies of Israeli hostages on Tuesday evening as Israel threatened to reduce aid into Gaza over delays to the release of remains.</strong> The Israeli military said in a statement: “According to information provided by the Red Cross, four coffins of deceased hostages have been transferred into their custody and are on their way to IDF (military) and ISA (security agency) forces in the Gaza Strip.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Four bodies returned earlier were named on Tuesday.</strong> Yossi Sharabi, Daniel Peretz, Guy Iluz and Bipin Joshi were named by hostage groups and the Israeli military.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump has warned that Hamas must disarm or “we will disarm them”</strong>, <strong>after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/14/gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas-palestine-hostages-detainees-truce-live-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68ee85538f085f84552e394a#block-68ee85538f085f84552e394a">he earlier declared</a> that phase two of his ceasefire agreement for Gaza “begins right now”. </strong>“They said they were going to disarm, and if they don’t disarm, we will disarm them,” the US president told reporters. Asked how he would do that, Trump said: “I don’t have explain that to you, but if they don’t disarm, we will disarm them. They know I’m not playing games.” Trump added that could happen “quickly and perhaps violently”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will stay closed through Wednesday and the flow of aid into the Palestinian enclave will be reduced, three Israeli officials said on Tuesday. </strong></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A nephew of late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has returned to the West Bank after four years of self-exile, outlining a roadmap to secure peace in Gaza with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a> transforming into a political party and declaring his readiness to help govern. </strong>Nasser al-Qudwa, a prominent critic of the current Palestinian leadership, also urged “a serious confrontation of corruption in this country”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Some of the near 2,000 Palestinian prisoners released on Monday are suffering from a range of health problems they developed during years in Israeli detention, doctors and freed prisoners in the occupied West Bank told the Associated Press. </strong>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories">Palestine</a> Medical Complex in Ramallah received 14 men released on Monday as part of the exchange and discharged all but two.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The European Union should maximise its influence in Gaza’s recovery process and join a US-proposed “Board of Peace” intended to temporarily oversee governance of the territory, the EU’s diplomatic arm said in a document seen by Reuters. </strong>Israel and the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas carried out a hostage-prisoner exchange on Monday and a ceasefire is in force under the first phase of president Donald Trump’s 20-point initiative for Gaza after two years of war.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal that halts two years of armed conflict in Gaza presents an opportunity for a lasting economic recovery in the region, the International Monetary Fund’s deputy chief economist said on Tuesday. </strong>Petya Koeva-Brooks said the IMF stands ready to cooperate with the international community on the recovery of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> and regional economies that have been deeply affected by the conflict, including Egypt and Jordan.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Gaza hospital receives the first 45 bodies of Palestinians detained by Israel</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Earlier today, the Associated Press reported that Gaza’s Nasser hospital had said it had received the first <strong>45 bodies of Palestinians</strong> who had been detained by the Israeli military since October 7, 2023.</p> 
  <p>The bodies were handed over by the international committee of the Red Cross as part of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement. A total of 450 bodies were to be returned to Gaza from Israel, the hospital said.</p> 
  <p>The hospital said <strong>some of the bodies showed signs of torture and having their hands bound</strong>. It was not immediately clear when or how they died.</p> 
  <p>On Monday, the last 20 living hostages were released to Israel in exchange for 1,808 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Hamas has so far returned the bodies of four of the remaining deceased hostages under the deal, and the Red Cross is currently on its way to Gaza to receive the remains of several more.</p> 
  <p>Palestinians who were freed in past exchanges have reported <strong>frequent beatings, insufficient food and deprivation of medical care in Israeli prisons</strong>. A 2024 UN report said that since October 7, 2023, <strong>thousands of Palestinian people have been held arbitrarily and incommunicado by Israel, often shackled, blindfolded, deprived of food, water, sleep and medical care and subjected to torture or degrading treatment</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Israel maintains that it follows international and domestic legal standards for the treatment of prisoners and that any violations by prison personnel are investigated. Far-right Israeli national security minister <strong>Itamar Ben-Gvir</strong>, <strong>who is in charge of prisons, has repeatedly boasted of making prison conditions for Palestinian people as harsh as possible while meeting the letter of the law</strong>.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump has warned that Hamas must disarm or “we will disarm them”</strong>, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/14/gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas-palestine-hostages-detainees-truce-live-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68ee85538f085f84552e394a#block-68ee85538f085f84552e394a">he earlier declared</a> that phase two of his ceasefire agreement for Gaza “begins right now”.</p> 
  <p>“They said they were going to disarm, and if they don’t disarm, we will disarm them,” the US president told reporters during a meeting with his Argentinian counterpart, Javier Milei, at the White House.</p> 
  <p>Asked how he would do that, Trump said: “<strong>I don’t have explain that to you, but if they don’t disarm, we will disarm them. They know I’m not playing games</strong>.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Trump added that could happen “quickly and perhaps violently”</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Pressed on a timeline for disarmament, Trump said only that it would be “<strong>a reasonable period of time … pretty quickly</strong>”.</p> 
  <p><strong>Trump also said he had received word from Hamas after speaking to the group that it would disarm</strong>, talks that he said were “through my people” at the highest level.</p> 
  <p>Hamas’s disarmament is a central tenement for phase two of Trump’s 20-point plan, and the militant group has previously rejected the idea outright. On Saturday, a senior official told AFP that disarmament was “out of the question”, adding: “The demand that we hand over our weapons is not up for negotiation.”</p>

  <p><strong>The UK could take a leading role in helping to disarm Hamas in Gaza, using lessons from the Northern Ireland peace process, British prime minister Keir Starmer told parliament on Tuesday.</strong></p> 
  <p>Starmer said decommissioning weapons would be “vital” for ensuring that Donald Trump’s ceasefire between Israel and Hamas endures:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Of course, this is going to be difficult, but it’s vital. It was difficult in Northern Ireland in relation to the IRA, but it was vital. That is why we have said we stand ready, based on our experience in Northern Ireland, to help with the decommissioning process.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Starmer’s national security adviser, <strong>Jonathan Powell</strong> – who played a role in the 1998 Good Friday agreement – attended the Gaza ceasefire summit in Egypt this week. Trump’s envoy <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong> has thanked Powell for his “incredible input and tireless efforts” in shaping the ceasefire plan.</p> 
  <p>Former prime minister <strong>Tony Blair</strong>, who worked closely with Powell during the Northern Ireland talks, has also been tipped for a role in Gaza’s postwar administration under Trump’s proposed “Board of Peace”.</p> 
  <p>When asked about the “Board of Peace” and Tony Blair’s reported involvement in it in an interview on ITV today, <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong> said: “Palestine needs to be run by Palestinians, and Gaza needs to be run by Palestinians.”</p> 
  <p>European diplomats told Reuters the <strong>Northern Ireland model</strong> is being discussed as a possible framework for Gaza, though no detailed plan is yet in place.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump says phase two for Gaza 'begins right now' despite darkening outlook for fragile ceasefire</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Phase two for Gaza “begins right now”</strong> <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has declared, even as the days-old truce appears increasingly fragile. The US president wrote on Truth Social just now that all 20 living hostages had been returned, but the dead “have not been returned, as promised”.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>ALL TWENTY HOSTAGES ARE BACK AND FEELING AS GOOD AS CAN BE EXPECTED. A big burden has been lifted, but the job IS NOT DONE. THE DEAD HAVE NOT BEEN RETURNED, AS PROMISED! Phase Two begins right NOW!!! President DJT</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>A crucial aspect of phase two of Trump’s peace plan is for a <strong>surge of humanitarian aid to enter Gaza</strong>, as masses of Palestinian people face starvation and parts of the territory have had famine declared. But Israel has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/14/gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas-palestine-hostages-detainees-truce-live-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68ee7c0d8f084a61287379bb#block-68ee7c0d8f084a61287379bb">reportedly informed the United Nations</a> it will only allow 300 aid trucks – half the agreed number – into Gaza on Wednesday and said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/14/gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas-palestine-hostages-detainees-truce-live-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68ee77258f084a612873798b#block-68ee77258f084a612873798b">the Rafah crossing will remain closed</a>, because it claimed Hamas had “violated” the ceasefire agreement regarding the release of the bodies of the remaining 24 deceased hostages.</p> 
  <p>Hamas has told mediators that the remains of four hostages will be transferred to Israel tonight at 10pm local time. <strong>The group has previously indicated that recovering the bodies of some dead hostages may take longer</strong>, as not all burial sites amid the sea of rubble in Gaza are known.</p> 
  <p>Indeed on Sunday, US vice-president <strong>JD Vance</strong> acknowledged the challenges and said that locating some of the bodies would take longer, while some may never be found. He <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/vance-says-some-deceased-hostages-may-never-recovered-despite-trump-peace-deal">told Fox News</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em><strong>The reality is that some of the hostages may never get back</strong>, but I do think, with some effort, we’ll be able to give them to their families so they at least have some closure.</em></p> 
   <p><em>We do want to give these people the ability to have a proper burial with their loved ones who were murdered by brutal terrorists, and that matters to us. It matters to the families, and it will remain a focus, but <strong>it’s going to take some time</strong>.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Israel has informed the UN it will allow only 300 aid trucks – half the agreed number – to enter Gaza from Wednesday, Reuters reports, citing a diplomatic note seen by the agency and confirmed by the UN.</strong></p> 
  <p>The <strong>Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT)</strong>, the Israeli military body overseeing aid flows, said the restrictions were being imposed because “<strong>Hamas violated the agreement regarding the release of the bodies of the hostages</strong>.” No fuel or gas will be permitted except for “specific humanitarian infrastructure needs”, the note added.</p> 
  <p><strong>Associated Press</strong> reported that the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was being tested as tensions rose over the slow return of the bodies of hostages. Israel has accused Hamas of breaching the truce terms by delaying the handover of 24 deceased captives; four bodies were transferred to Israel on Monday.</p> 
  <p>Three AP sources said word of the aid cuts had been passed to US officials and international agencies. The Israeli government has not commented.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Surge of aid in Gaza has not begun, aid agencies say</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The Red Cross and UN agencies have said the expected surge of aid into Gaza has not begun, warning of growing hunger as the Rafah crossing remains closed.</strong></p> 
  <p>“We need all crossings open,” said <strong>Unicef</strong> spokesperson <strong>Ricardo Pires</strong>. “The longer Rafah stays closed, the more the suffering prolongs for people in Gaza, especially those displaced in the south.”</p> 
  <p>Three Israeli officials told Reuters the decision to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/14/gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas-palestine-hostages-detainees-truce-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68ee584e8f08e8effe094230#block-68ee584e8f08e8effe094230">keep Rafah closed through Wednesday</a> and restrict supplies was linked to delays by Hamas in returning the bodies of Israeli hostages. Hamas said finding the bodies was difficult amid the destruction.</p> 
  <p>“The shift has not yet happened,” said <strong>Christian Cardon</strong>, spokesperson for the <strong>International Committee of the Red Cross</strong>, which has acted as a neutral intermediary in the handovers of hostages. “We are still witnessing only a few trucks coming in, and large crowds approaching these trucks in a way that does absolutely not conform to humanitarian standards.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">What issues are still to be resolved in the Gaza ceasefire deal?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>My colleagues <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/archie-bland">Archie Bland</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont">Peter Beaumont</a> have done a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/14/what-issues-still-to-be-resolved-gaza-ceasefire-deal">useful explainer</a> on the unresolved issues surrounding the ceasefire agreement, which is still in its early stages of its implementation. Here are some of the main issues they have identified:</em></p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Israeli withdrawal:</strong></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>So far, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> has pulled back from Gaza’s major cities, to a “yellow line” that means it occupies about 53% of the territory. In theory, withdrawals will follow in two further stages: first, when an international stabilisation force is mobilised; second, to a lasting “security buffer zone”.</p> 
  <p>But Benjamin Netanyahu’s language in recent days had a different emphasis. “The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] remains deep inside Gaza territory and controls all of its dominating points,” he said <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/spoke-statement101025">in a statement last week</a>. “We are encircling Hamas from all directions.”</p> 
  <p>Without real carrots and sticks for Netanyahu, the recent precedents for further withdrawal are not promising.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Hamas disarmament</strong></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Disarmament is a central tenet of the Trump plan – but on Saturday a senior Hamas official <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkr1yb00tlg">told Agence France-Presse</a> that disarmament was “out of the question”, adding: “The demand that we hand over our weapons is not up for negotiation.” Even as the hostages were released on Monday, there were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/hamas-deploys-armed-fighters-and-police-across-parts-of-gaza">images of armed fighters in parts of Gaza</a>, an apparent attempt by Hamas to reassert its authority.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Will there be a transition to Palestinian-led governance?</strong></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The White House plan was devised with no meaningful input from Palestinian civil society on the ground in Gaza. The transitional government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/tony-blair-wins-nod-from-palestine-authority-for-role-in-postwar-gaza">will involve the former British prime minister Tony Blair</a> but as yet no credible Palestinian figure. Netanyahu appears unwilling to accept the eventual role for the Palestinian Authority floated by the US; in any case, that body and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, are deeply unpopular in Gaza. There is no Palestinian ownership of this process. It is not a grand peace deal with a vision of a state at the end of it.</p>

  <p><strong>British prime minister Keir Starmer spoke about the Gaza ceasefire in the House of Commons this morning.</strong></p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Let me now turn to the Middle East and words I have longed to say in this house for a very long time – the surviving hostages are freed, the bombardment of Gaza has stopped and desperately needed aid is starting to enter as a result of the peace plan led by President Trump.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Starmer said the relief is tempered by concern for those who have died, and for the innocent civilians killed. “This has been two years of living hell,” he said.</p> 
  <p>He said the ceasefire deal is historic. But “what matters now is implementation”, and this has to happen as quickly as possible.</p> 
  <p>He went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Let no one be any doubt that none of this would have been possible without President Trump.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But Starmer also paid tribute to international allies, and he says the UK has “worked behind the scenes for months with the US, Arab and European nations to help deliver a ceasefire, get the hostages out, get aid in and secure a better future for Israel”.</p>

  <p><strong>Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty told the Associated Press ahead of Monday’s summit that 15 Palestinian technocrats have been selected to administer postwar Gaza. He said their names were already vetted by Israel, without disclosing them.</strong></p> 
  <p>“We need to deploy them to take care of the daily life of the people in Gaza, and the board of peace should support and supervise the flow of finance and money, which will come for the reconstruction of Gaza,” he said, referring to a board that would govern Gaza and be chaired by US president Donald Trump.</p> 
  <p>Abdelatty said the 15-member committee had already been approved by all Palestinian factions, including Hamas.</p> 
  <p>He said Hamas members welcomed Trump’s plan. They “have no role in the transitional period. They are committed to that. That is why they are working on an administrative Palestinian committee to be deployed in order to take care of the daily life of the people of Gaza,” Abdelatty said.</p> 
  <p>For its part, Israel has to comply with a withdrawal from Gaza, allowing a flow of aid the deployment of the administrative committee on the ground to ensure security for civilians, Abdelatty said. Hamas also must honor its commitments, he said.</p> 
  <p>Egypt announced that it would host a reconstruction and recovery conference for Gaza with the help of the US and Germany.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>There are promising early indications from countries, including the US as well as Arab and European states, about their willingness to contribute to the $70bn (£53bn) cost of rebuilding Gaza, a UN development programme official has said.</p> 
  <p>“We’ve had very good indications already,” UNDP’s Jaco Cilliers told reporters at a press conference in Geneva, without giving details.</p> 
  <p>He estimated that Israel’s war had generated at least 55 million tons of rubble.</p> 
  <p>The latest UN data taken from satellite imagery between 22 September and 23 showed about 80% of all structures in Gaza City are damaged, including about 17,734 buildings that have been completely destroyed.</p> 
  <p>UNDP says it has started some clearance amid the rubble, but unexploded ordnance is hampering the pace of its work.</p>

  <p>UN investigators <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-committed-genocide-in-gaza-says-un-inquiry">said last month</a> that they had determined that Israel has committed “genocide” in Gaza since October 2023, with the “intent to destroy the Palestinians” in the territory.</p> 
  <p>The UN investigators cited examples of the scale of the Israeli killings, aid blockages, forced displacement and the destruction of a fertility clinic to back up its genocide finding.</p> 
  <p>The 1948 UN Genocide Convention defines genocide as crimes committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such”. To count as genocide, at least one of five acts must have occurred.</p> 
  <p>The UN commission found that Israel had committed four of them: killing; causing serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of the Palestinians in whole or in part; and imposing measures intended to prevent births.</p> 
  <p>Israel is fighting allegations at the world’s top court, the international court of justice, of committing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/explainer-what-is-the-icj-and-what-is-south-africas-claim-against-israel">genocide in Gaza</a>. Israel has denied the claims.</p>

  <p>Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson <strong>Majed al-Ansari</strong> has been speaking to Fox News about the ceasefire agreement. Doha, along with Cairo and Washington, has been a key mediator between Israel and Hamas during the Israeli assault. </p> 
  <p>Asked by Fox News about the prospects of moving to phase 2 of the US-brokered agreement, al-Ansari said: “We had delayed a lot of discussions around stage one … in order to make sure stage one happens.</p> 
  <p>“The difficult discussions have begun, as to how it will look like (phase 2) to secure Gaza, administer it and ensure that there is no war again.”</p> 
  <p>The last Gaza ceasefire broke down after two months in March when Israel resumed its deadly assault. There are fears that this truce may also prove precarious, especially given the resistance from the far-right wing of the Benjamin Netanyahu’s fragile coalition.</p>

  <p>Many Palestinian people have faced starvation and have had to endure extreme hunger as the UN and other organisations have faced massive logistical obstacles including widespread looting, Israeli bombardments, Israel’s administrative restrictions and bureaucracy and infrastructure damaged by Israeli attacks within Gaza.</p>

  <p>Palestinian people in Gaza have received only a trickle of aid over recent months.

  <p><strong>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</strong>, head of the World Health Organization (WHO), said they have been scaling up their operations since the ceasefire took hold, including bringing eight trucks of medical supplies – which included insulin and lab supplies – into the region.</p>

  <p>The former US president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> has commended <strong>Donald Trump</strong> on his Gaza plan, saying it put an end to the “unimaginable hell” of the last living 20 hostages who were being held by Hamas and brought a chance of peace to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1977876858310992109">In a post on X</a>, he wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted">

   <p><em>The road to this deal was not easy. My Administration worked relentlessly to bring hostages home, get relief to Palestinian civilians, and end the war. I commend President Trump and his team for their work to get a renewed ceasefire deal over the finish line.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Now, with the backing of the United States and the world, the Middle East is on a path to peace that I hope endures and a future for Israelis and Palestinians alike with equal measures of peace, dignity, and safety.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>During his presidency, Biden, a Democratic president, supplied Israel with vast amounts of weaponry that was used to devastating effect across the territory, killing tens of thousands of people, many of whom were civilians.</p> 
  <p>The US also gave Israel key diplomatic shelter that helped enable Benjamin Netanyahu to continue a war many legal scholars have said is a genocide.</p>

  <p><em>Jason Burke is the Guardian’s international security correspondent</em></p> 
  <p>Hamas has started deploying armed fighters and police across parts of Gaza in an apparent attempt to reassert authority in the devastated Palestinian territory after the ceasefire deal agreed with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> last week.</p> 
  <p>Images showed dozens of Hamas fighters at a hospital in southern Gaza during the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/israeli-hostage-release-hamas-gaza-last-living">release of Israeli hostages on Monday morning</a> and there were reports of shootings and executions elsewhere in the territory. </p> 
  <p>Telegram channels associated with Hamas said “collaborators and traitors” had been targeted, a reference to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/30/israel-backed-militia-groups-potentially-threaten-new-peace-plan-for-gaza">Israel-backed militia in the territory</a>, while Hamas gunmen also engaged in bloody clashes with a powerful local family in Gaza City over the weekend.</p> 
  <p>The violence is unlikely to immediately threaten the current ceasefire agreement with Israel but raises significant concerns over the disarmament of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a>, a key though ill-defined provision of the deal, and the challenges that will confront the new stabilisation force of regional troops that is to be deployed to Gaza.</p>

  <p>Speaking at the Knesset – the Israeli parliament – yesterday, Donald Trump said the US is prepared to make a deal with Iran when Tehran is ready. </p> 
  <p>Tehran and Washington held five rounds of nuclear talks, prior to Israel’s 12-day war Iran in June, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/22/trump-announces-us-strikes-on-iran-what-we-know-so-far-fordow-israel-nuclear">which Washington joined by striking key Iranian nuclear sites</a>.</p> 
  <p>The talks faced major stumbling blocks such as the issue of uranium enrichment on Iranian soil, which western powers want to bring down to zero, a plan that Tehran has rejected.</p> 
  <p>“We are ready when you are and it will be the best decision that Iran has ever made, and it’s going to happen,” Trump told Israeli parliamentarians yesterday, referring to a deal with Iran.</p> 
  <p>“The hand of friendship and cooperation is open. I’m telling you, they (Iran) want to make a deal … it would be great if we could make a deal,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Iran said this morning that Trump’s call for a peace deal with Tehran was inconsistent with Washington’s actions, referring to its strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in June.</p> 
  <p>“The desire for peace and dialogue expressed by the US president is at odds with the hostile and criminal behaviour of the United States towards the Iranian people,” <a href="https://en.mfa.ir/portal/newsview/776490">the foreign ministry said in a statement</a>.</p> 
  <p>“How can one attack the residential areas and nuclear facilities of a country in the midst of political negotiations, kill more than 1,000 people including innocent women and children, and then demand peace and friendship?” the foreign ministry asked.</p> 
  <p>Tehran accused the US of being “a leading producer of terrorism and a supporter of the terrorist and genocidal Zionist regime”. </p> 
  <p>Iran has insisted it has no intention of developing nuclear weapons but western countries have said they are not convinced of Tehran’s claim its nuclear programme has purely peaceful purposes.</p>

  <p>The two-state solution would see an independent Palestinian state in the <strong>West Bank</strong> and <strong>Gaza</strong> that would exist alongside <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>.</p> 
  <p>This Palestinian state would broadly be drawn along the lines that existed prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and would have <strong>east Jerusalem</strong> as its capital.</p> 
  <p><strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>’s government has repeatedly rejected a two-state solution.</p> 
  <p>“In fact, they effectively had a Palestinian state – in Gaza. What did they do with that state? Peace? Co-existence?” the Israeli prime minister told the UN general assembly last month.</p> 
  <p>“No, they attacked us time and time again, totally unprovoked, they fired rockets into our cities, they murdered our children, they turned Gaza into a terror base from which they committed the October 7 massacre,” he added, referring to the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel two years ago, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.</p> 
  <p>Around three-quarters of the 193 UN member states recognise the Palestinian state proclaimed in 1988 by the exiled Palestinian leadership.</p> 
  <p>The US, Israel’s closest ally, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/uk-canada-and-australia-announce-formal-recognition-of-palestine-with-wave-of-israel-allies-to-follow">criticised the decision last month</a> by allies including Britain, Australia and Canada to recognise Palestine as a state.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump hopes for the 'rebuilding of Gaza' and says he has not made up his mind on two-state solution</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We have some comments made by <strong>Donald Trump</strong> on his way back from the Egyptian summit where Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the US signed a declaration as guarantors of the ceasefire deal which is aimed at ending Israel’s devastating war on Gaza.</p> 
  <p>When asked on Air Force One if his deal and the return of all 20 living Israeli hostages could lead to a Palestinian state, Trump said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We’re talking about rebuilding Gaza. I’m not talking about single state or double state or two-state. We’re talking about the rebuilding of Gaza.</em></p> 
   <p><em>A lot of people like the one-state solution. Some people like the two-state solutions. We’ll have to see. I haven’t commented on that.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>According to the Sharm el Sheikh declaration, the signatories pledged to “pursue a comprehensive vision of peace, security and shared prosperity in the region”, and also welcomed “the progress achieved in establishing comprehensive and durable peace arrangements in the Gaza Strip”.</p> 
  <p>But the statement was extremely vague about the path ahead for a sustainable peace between Israel and its neighbours, including the Palestinians, making no mention of a one- or two-state solution.</p> 
  <p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who co-chaired the summit with Trump, said the Gaza deal “closes a painful chapter in human history” and sets the stage for a two-state solution.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israelis and Palestinians celebrate hostage and detainee releases as key truce issues remain</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Israel and Hamas moved ahead on a key first step of the tenuous Gaza ceasefire agreement on Monday by<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/israelis-and-palestinians-celebrate-truce-as-trump-promises-new-era-of-peace"> freeing hostages and detainees</a>, raising hopes that the US-brokered deal might lead to a permanent end to the devastating two-year war.</p> 
  <p>But contentious issues such as whether Hamas will disarm and who will govern Gaza remain unresolved, highlighting the fragility of the truce.</p> 
  <p>In key developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Hamas released the remaining 20 living hostages in Gaza on Monday as part of a swap deal for nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees</strong> in a rare moment of joy among Israelis and Palestinians.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>World leaders from more than 20 countries later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/donald-trump-sets-sights-peace-iran-hails-end-war-israel-hamas">met in Egypt</a> at a summit</strong> co-chaired by Donald Trump and Egyptian president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-fatah-al-sisi">Abdel Fatah al-Sisi</a> to try to ensure the limited truce is extended into a durable peace.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>“At long last, we have peace in the Middle East,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Trump</a> declared at the meeting, with his counterparts lined up behind him</strong>. The US president signed a joint declaration with the leaders of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt">Egypt</a>, Qatar and Turkey intended to turn the ceasefire into a coherent peace plan, amid widespread anxiety over how long the truce will last. Representatives from Israel and Hamas were absent from the signing ceremony.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>In Israel, Trump addressed the Knesset (parliament) earlier on Monday</strong>, urging lawmakers to seize a chance for broader peace in the region and saying a “long nightmare” for both Israelis and Palestinians was over.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>In Tel Aviv <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/trump-did-everything-jubilant-israelis-heap-praise-on-us-president-as-hostages-return">an estimated 65,000 Israelis</a> in “Hostages Square” cheered when a military helicopter carrying the 20 freed Israelis flew overhead</strong> en route to hospital. Live footage of their release and family reunions was broadcast at the square. The bodies of four hostages held in Gaza and handed over to the Red Cross by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a> on Monday were brought back to Israel, the army said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A large crowd also massed in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis on Monday to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/palestinian-prisoners-return-home">celebrate the return</a> of nearly 1,700 Palestinians</strong> detained over the course of the war, while in the West Bank capital of Ramallah people welcomed the arrival of 88 Palestinian detainees who had been serving life sentences imposed by Israeli courts. About 160 more were deported through Egypt after their release.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The UN warned that Gaza still needed “lifesaving aid”. Aid deliveries had begun arriving in Gaza </strong>and far more were poised to enter in the coming days, said the UN’s humanitarian relief branch, OCHA.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The ceasefire appeared to be holding in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> on Monday</strong> after a two-year Israeli military onslaught that has killed nearly 68,000 people following Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The last Gaza ceasefire broke down after two months in March</strong> when Israel resumed its offensive. Trump insists his 20-point proposal for maintaining peace and rebuilding Gaza will take root.<br><em><strong>With reporting by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/julianborger">Julian Borger</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/seham-tantesh">Seham Tantesh</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey">Daniel Boffey</a> and the Associated Press</strong></em></p></li>
