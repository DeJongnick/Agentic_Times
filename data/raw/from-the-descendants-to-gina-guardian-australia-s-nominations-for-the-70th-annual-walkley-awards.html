<p>Guardian Australia has picked up four nominations in the 70th annual Walkley awards for excellence in journalism.</p> <p>The Indigenous affairs team was nominated twice – in coverage of Indigenous affairs and digital media: innovation journalism – for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/the-descendants">The Descendants</a> project.</p> <p>The multi-part series, which built on Guardian Australia’s 2019 Walkley award winning series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2019/mar/04/massacre-map-australia-the-killing-times-frontier-wars">The Killing Times</a>, explored the deeply personal process of truth-telling about some of the most horrific incidents in Australia’s past, from both sides of the frontier.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The team was led by Lorena Allam, Guardian Australia’s former editor of Indigenous Affairs, now industry professor at the Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and Research at UTS, as well as former Guardian Australia Indigenous affairs reporter Sarah Collard, and Guardian Australia Indigenous affairs reporter, Ella Archibald-Binge.</p> <p>The Descendants data and interactive were built by the data and interactives editor, Nick Evershed, and editorial developer,<strong> </strong>Andy Ball.

The series revealed 57 inmates have died in 19 separate prisons using hanging points that authorities knew about. It shone a light on Australia’s inaction to remove hanging points from its jails, despite it being a key recommendation of the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody.</p> <p>Guardian Australia’s podcast series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/gina--power--privilege-and-influence">Gina: power, privilege and influence</a> was nominated in the audio long category.
