<p>Out of nowhere, a flock of goldfinch arcs overhead, at least 15 of them, gathering to escape the winter months on this exposed moor. The shape they make is fluid and effortless in its constant change, whereas I almost lose balance trying to follow them as they sweep overhead from behind me. I watch as they break around an obstacle, over, around and through, before merging again. Then I realise what the obstacle is. It’s another group, almost as clumsy as I am, but charming nevertheless – a small herd of cattle.</p> <p>I can see at once that they come in two flavours, red polls and Welsh blacks. They are smaller breeds that are happy on a wild moor, content to get on with the task they’ve been set: reshaping and restoring the moor’s ecology. The landscape around me used to be heavily populated with sheep, and their legacy is everywhere. </p> <p>Sheep graze differently from cattle, nibbling anything palatable down to the roots but avoiding the tough, tussock-forming moor grass that slowly took over. Cattle use their long tongues to rip up the&nbsp;moor grass, and their hooves break the surface of the ground, allowing seeds to get established, increasing biodiversity. This conservation grazing has had an&nbsp;impact. The number of whinchats, for example, almost tripled in the five years after the cattle arrived.</p> <p>At weekends, the moor is thronged with walkers. Some people are unnerved by cattle; others see them as the perfect chance for a selfie. Keeping 5 metres away is recommended. The Eastern Moors Partnership, which manages the moor, works with its grazing tenant to keep things mellow. Their breeds are easy-going creatures, but not as photogenic as Highland cattle, with their extravagant horns and shaggy coat. Those guys get more attention; a small herd elsewhere in the Peak are all over the socials. </p> <p>Elsewhere in Derbyshire, <a href="https://www.derbyshirewildlifetrust.org.uk/news/elk-bison-beaver-rewilding-britain-award-funding-projects-exploring-return-lost-species">plans are afoot</a> to see if elks could help in restoring nature. Instagram will love them too. Meanwhile, this good-natured group put their heads down and get on with the job.</p> <p>• Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/under-the-changing-skies-9781783353101/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=article">guardianbookshop.com</a> and get a 15% discount</p>
