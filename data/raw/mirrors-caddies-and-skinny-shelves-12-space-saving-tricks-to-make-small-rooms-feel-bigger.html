<p>Large rooms need more – and bigger – furniture, so small rooms just need fewer, smaller pieces, right? Not entirely. In fact, there’s a lot more to creating a successful small space than that.</p> <p>When looking at a room, don’t just think about the floor plan; consider it as a three-dimensional space and ask yourself: what can be hung from the ceiling? What can be wall mounted? How many hooks could I put on the back of that door? Find the perfect skinny shelves to fit in that gap behind the door and suddenly you’ve freed up a lot of space in the rest of the room.</p> <p>We asked interior designers and architects for their tips and products for making small spaces work harder and feel bigger than they are.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>How to make the most of small spaces</h2> <p>***</p> <h2>Side tables</h2>    <p><strong>Fermob </strong><strong>Alizé end table</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.fermob-london.co.uk/alize-offset-low-table/p7529"><sub>£239 at Fermob</sub></a></p> <p>“Occasional” furniture is too much of a luxury for small spaces, where each piece has to earn its keep. Look for side tables that double as stools for squeezing extra guests around the table, or ones that conceal generous storage. I’ve used a wicker laundry basket from <a href="https://www.zarahome.com/gb/fabriclined-laundry-basket-l47528049">Zara Home</a> as a side table, with a circular Ikea tray on top (it’s also great for stashing away toys at the end of the day). Mine are no longer in stock, but you just need to match the diameters of each, or you could try this <a href="https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.1258241001.html">H&amp;M basket </a>on its own with the lid inverted. Also think about pieces that can double as outdoor furniture. Designer Hannah Campbell of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/campbellandcottrill/">Campbell &amp; Cottrill</a> recommends Fermob for small, lightweight tables: “We recently supplied one of these for a client with a balcony, and it’s been used inside all winter as an extra side table.”</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Hideaway desks</h2>    <p><strong>La Redoute </strong><strong>Mathéo hideaway cabinet desk</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.laredoute.co.uk/ppdp/prod-350318429.aspx"><sub>£819.99 at La Redoute</sub></a><br><a href="https://www.next.co.uk/style/su637048/f45463"><sub>£820 at Next</sub></a></p> <p>There are lots of great occasional desks, from vintage bureaus sourced secondhand, to foldaway and wall-mounted designs (<a href="https://www.wayfair.co.uk/furniture/pdp/17-stories-caramie-desk-u002346350.html">Wayfair</a> does a hideaway version with a top shelf that squeezes in another element of storage). Then there’s this striking design from La Redoute, which is on the expensive side but so functional it’s almost like buying another room – and it looks great even when tidied away for the weekend.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Overdoor caddies</h2>    <p><strong>Overdoor oak caddy</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.futoncompany.co.uk/shop-by-product/organise/utility-and-laundry/overdoor-caddy.html"><sub>£65 at Futon Company</sub></a></p> <p>Make the most of the backs of doors by adding hooks – for everything from coats to tomorrow’s work outfit (I’ve used <a href="https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.0631490010.html">H&amp;M ones</a> for years). They can also accommodate tote bags full of hard-to-store occasional stuff. Better still, get an overdoor caddy like this clean-lined oak version from the Futon Company. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/22/renter-friendly-home-updates-uk">From stick-on tiles to bookshelves: nine easy ways to update your rental home on a budget</a> </p> </aside>  <p>***</p> <h2>Rechargeable lights</h2>    <p><strong>Mushroom wall light</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-mushroom-rechargeable-dimmable-wall-light/yellow/p112125956"><sub>£48 at John Lewis</sub></a></p> <p>In the past few years, rechargeable lights have become a mainstay. They work brilliantly in spaces where wiring is hard to access or looks ugly. Campbell recommends Pooky’s <a href="https://www.pooky.com/products/scoon-rechargeable-table-lamp-in-shale">Scoon</a> table lamp, Fermob’s <a href="https://www.heals.com/balad-led-outdoor-table-lamp-medium.html">Balad</a> lamps and Fatboy’s <a href="https://www.lampmasters.co.uk/p/bolleke-portable-pendant-ip55-red-fatboyr-3569051.html">Bolleke</a> lamps. Rechargeables are also perfect for by the bed, eliminating clutter. This simple design from John Lewis is dimmable and comes in eight colours and finishes.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Hanging baskets</h2>    <p><strong>Bayonne triple hanging basket</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.futoncompany.co.uk/shop-by-product/organise/baskets/bayonne-triple-hanging-basket.html"><sub>£28 at Futon Company</sub></a></p> <p>Don’t forget the ceiling. Free up surface space by placing indoor plants in clusters of macrame hangers – <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/market/macrame_plant_hanger">Etsy</a> is great for these – or place plant pots and drip trays in a triple hanging basket. They are also a great way to keep cuddly toy collections close to a child’s bed.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Storage seating</h2>    <p><strong>Storage 02</strong></p> <p><a href="https://swyfthome.com/products/storage-ottoman-2"><sub>From £449 at Swyft</sub></a></p> <p>Edward Martin of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/delvearchitects/?hl=en-gb">Delve Architects</a> recommends incorporating a built-in dining bench in kitchens wherever possible: “As well as seating, they provide storage underneath, through pull-out drawers or a liftable lid. When the dining table is not in use, it can be pushed in close to the bench, providing more floor space.” Meanwhile, Campbell is a fan of ottomans in smaller living rooms and bedrooms, like this velvet one from Swyft, which comes in eight colours.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Kitchen storage</h2>    <p><strong>Anyday</strong><strong> Laguna shelving unit</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-anyday-laguna-medium-shelving-unit/p112612981"><sub>£129 at John Lewis</sub></a></p>    <p><strong>Vodka table</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.futoncompany.co.uk/shop-by-product/furniture/tables/vodka-table.html"><sub>£179 at Futon Company</sub></a></p> <p>There are many ways to boost storage in the kitchen. “If space is tight, a plate rack over the sink is a two-for-one move allowing plates to drip dry,” says interior designer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jillmacnair/?hl=en-gb">Jill Macnair</a>. Dunelm’s practical <a href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/black-smart-industrial-corner-storage-rack-1000209126">corner storage rack</a> maximises space on a small worktop. If gadgets are taking over your surfaces, look for stacking storage – Debenhams does a <a href="https://www.debenhams.com/product/living-and-home-3-tier-wooden-spice-rack-microwave-oven-rack-with-hooks-chopping-board-holder-kitchen-organizer-storage-shelf_p-0fd31cf2-3228-409d-978f-be18b73ef133">three-tier kitchen organiser</a>. For something bespoke, <a href="https://lugna.online/">Lugna</a> has a great shelving range for tight spaces that would work well in the kitchen.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Flexible shelves</h2>    <p>Wall-mounted shelves are an obvious go-to in smaller spaces. Macnair suggests using overlooked spaces in halls and corridors and above doors. “Ideally, run the shelf wall-to-wall in a nice wood or MDF painted the same colour as your walls,” she says. For a shelving system, Martin says: “Nothing beats <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/606">Vitsoe’s 606 hanging system</a>. It keeps storage off the floor to create the illusion of space. You can customise them to create study areas, bookshelves or closed storage.” </p> <p>If you’re on a budget, most shop-fitting suppliers sell similar customisable ranges, for example, <a href="https://www.tradesystems.co.uk/Twin-Slot-Shelving.html">Trade Systems</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Statement mirror</h2>    <p><strong>Irregular rattan wall mirror</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.zarahome.com/gb/irregular-rattan-wall-mirror-l46307106"><sub>£199.99 at Zara Home</sub></a></p> <p>Mirrors are a small spaces cliche for a reason, but they can be used in unexpected ways. In its <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/1021746/fortyfour-house-fardaa">Fortyfour</a> house project, architecture studio <a href="https://fardaa.co.uk/">Fardaa</a> used mirrors as unobtrusive fronts for kitchen cabinets, positioned above head height to create extra storage. They also work well as plinths in kitchens and bathrooms to give a floating effect that makes rooms feel bigger. Or keep it simple with a statement piece. “A large-scale wall mirror will create a brighter, more open feel, enhancing the sense of space,” says interior designer Antonia Winkler von Stiernhielm of <a href="https://www.studio-anton.com/">Studio Anton</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Ottoman bed</h2>    <p><strong>Primrose ottoman double bed</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.buttonandsprung.com/primrose-double-ottoman-in-ivory-fabric#selection.fabric=5579&amp;selection.bed_size=5511&amp;selection.bed_type=5520"><sub>£1,495 at Button &amp; Sprung</sub></a><sub> </sub></p>    <p><strong>Chadwell ottoman double bed</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4197452"><sub>£300 at Argos</sub></a></p> <p>I recently bought my first one of these – beds with storage underneath – and experienced a “where have you been all my life?” moment. They are much easier to access than I imagined and store A LOT – bedding, books, out-of-season clothes, luggage. “I frequently recommend Ottoman beds for clients’ spare rooms, where space is at a premium,” says <strong>Winkler von Stiernhielm</strong>. Adding a valance can soften their aesthetic, she says. </p> <p>***</p> <h2>Floating bedside tables</h2>    <p><strong>Jimi wall-mounted bedside table</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.laredoute.co.uk/ppdp/prod-350102204.aspx"><sub>£169.99 at La Redoute</sub></a></p> <p>Wall-mounted “floating” furniture is a brilliant way to free up floor space and boost the sense of flow in a room. There are lots of great floating nightstands, so think about your bedside storage needs. Look for designs that feature a drawer for clutter and a shelf for books.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Drop-leaf tables</h2>    <p><strong>Danderyd</strong><strong> drop-leaf dining table</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/danderyd-drop-leaf-table-oak-veneer-white-10516121/"><sub>£199 at Ikea</sub></a></p> <p>These designs typically transform from a console table to space for dinner à deux – or more if you open both leaves. They were a mainstay of the postwar kitchen, and it is still easy to source vintage versions on Facebook Marketplace, eBay or local forums (it’s much harder to find new versions). Melamine finishes have a cheery, nostalgic feel; also look for versions with a built-in drawer or cupboard.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Buttons.">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/11/20/small-blue-link-embed-nov-24.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
