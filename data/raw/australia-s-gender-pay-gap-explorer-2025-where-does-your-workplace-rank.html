<p>Newly released data shows the the gender pay gap at over 7,800 employers, with the data covering every private company with 100 employees or more in Australia.</p> 
<p>In this interactive graphic we have updated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2024/feb/27/gender-pay-gap-parity-australia-salaries-men-women-explore-company-lookup">our 2024 pay gap explorer</a> to the newly released figures from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency.</p>

<p>The data has been collated differently in 2025, which makes a yearly comparison difficult – in 2024, if some or all of a corporate group’s subsidiaries had similar gender equality policies and strategies, <a href="https://www.wgea.gov.au/about/our-legislation/publishing-employer-gender-pay-gaps">these employers could report as a “submission group</a>”.</p>

</ul> 
<p>For 2025 the data covers corporate groups, subsidiaries of corporate groups and standalone employers.</p> 
<p>In our graphic, each dot is an employer, and shows the median gender pay gap by total remuneration. This is the percentage difference between the median of what a man is paid and the median of what a woman is paid within an organisation.</p> 
<p>The pay gaps are not reflective of companies paying male and female employees different amounts for the same work, which has been illegal for more than 50 years, but mostly represent men working in higher-paid roles within a company.</p> 
<p>Negative values indicate a pay gap in favour of women, or organisations in which women are paid more, while positive values indicate a pay gap in favour of men, or organisations in which men are paid more.</p> 
<p>Use the search bar to find specific companies, or the other controls to explore the data. Employers are able to post public statements to accompany their pay gap results, which you can find at WGEA’s website <a href="https://www.wgea.gov.au/data-statistics/data-explorer">here</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Notes</strong></h2> 
<p>This graphic uses the total remuneration pay gap from WGEA.</p> 
<p>The WGEA explains its methods for calculating the pay gap as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><em>Average: the average gender pay gap is the difference between women’s and men’s average earnings, expressed as a percentage of men’s average earnings.</em></p></li> 
 <li><p><em>Median: the median gender pay gap is the difference between the median woman’s and median man’s average earnings, expressed as a percentage of the average man’s earnings.</em></p></li> 
</ul> 
<p>The WGEA scores pay gaps as “in favour of men” &gt; 5%, “in favour of women” &lt; -5%, and “neutral”, where neutral is within -5% and 5%, and they further describe the “neutral” category:</p> 
<p><em>A gender pay gap of +/-5% allows for normal business fluctuations and employee movements, while signifying that an employer has a focus on gender equality and is taking action to ensure there is gender equality at all levels of their organisation.</em></p>
