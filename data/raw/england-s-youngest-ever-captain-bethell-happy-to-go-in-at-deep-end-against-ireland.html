<p>Jacob Bethell is ready for England to “chuck me in the deep end” as he prepares to lead the side for the first time against Ireland on Wednesday, making him the country’s youngest men’s captain. </p> 
<p>With Harry Brook rested for this quickfire three-match Twenty20 series in Malahide, just north of Dublin, the 21-year-old steps in to continue his brisk rise in international cricket. </p> 
<p>Bethell made <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/11/travis-head-helps-blast-australia-to-t20-liftoff-against-inexperienced-england">his England debut last September</a> and impressed in his first Test series against New Zealand at the end of the year. Yet to seal a regular place in the red-ball XI, he has become an automatic pick in Brendon McCullum’s white-ball teams.</p>

<p>“Baz gave me a ring and said I was going to be skipper,” said Bethell. “Not a whole lot has been said of why I’ve been chosen for the role. I don’t know the exact thinking of those who are in charge. I guess it’s maybe just a bit of trust, and showing a bit of faith. It will be nice to see how I go under pressure, and I’m sure that the guys that have made the decision would like to see that as well. </p> 
<p>“I like when things come at a fast pace, it tends to get me up and about. So I like those situations, doesn’t mean that they always work. But hopefully this one&nbsp;does.”</p> 
<p>Even with plenty of experienced names in the squad to face Ireland, Bethell’s ascension is in line with the management’s wilder impulses when it comes to selection. He will have to fall back on his previous experience of leading England Under-19s.</p>

<p>“A very young one,” replied a smiling Bethell when asked what type of captain he is. “The main thing I’ve looked up to in captains I’ve had previously is how they manage people. Not every tactical decision you make is going to work, but it’s managing the boys well so they feel you’re backing them. I’ve got no preconceived ideas of how I’m going to be.”</p> 
<p>Bethell has found form with the bat since he was announced as captain last month, having hit his first professional century in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/07/england-south-africa-third-one-day-international-match-report">third ODI against South Africa</a> less than a fortnight ago. “I didn’t play for a while and maybe lost a little bit of rhythm, but felt that rhythm come back about midway through the Hundred so it’s great to be back feeling good.” He did not get dragged into any detailed Ashes talk: “My head’s firmly screwed on to this series.”</p> 
<p>Harry Tector and Paul Stirling “are the two main threats with the bat” for Ireland, said Bethell. The hosts enter underprepared having <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/ireland-cricket-england-dublin-malahide-t20-series">not played since June</a> – a completely different story to England – and will be without the whippy left-arm pace of Josh Little, on the mend from a rib injury. Yet the only completed T20 meeting between these two sides brought <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/26/ireland-stun-england-at-t20-world-cup-to-throw-super-12s-wide-open">an Irish victory in Melbourne</a> at the World Cup three years ago, a reminder that it may not be all smooth for Bethell over the coming days.</p>
