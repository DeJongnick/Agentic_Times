<h2>Stacey &amp; Joe</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>In the first series of Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash’s life-at-home series, Joe was a bit useless. “You said Pickle Cottage is like our relationship: it constantly needs work,” reflects Stacey in this second series. “I haven’t seen you put much work in!” Has he taken note? Well, there’s a promise of “more romance” as they go away for his birthday. Leave your cynicism at the door – it’s undeniably sweet viewing. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>The Great British Bake Off</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong></p>    <p>It’s biscuit week on Bake Off, and if you think we’d resort to cheap puns, you’d be absolutely right. Noel and Alison whisk the bakers through a batch of crumb-believable challenges, including crafting a classic chocolate Hobnob. When it comes to the crunch, who’ll be a jammie dodger and who’ll crumble under pressure? <em>Ali Catter</em><em>all</em></p> <h2>The Yorkshire Vet</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 5</strong><strong><br></strong>A lamb that has been born with five legs and six feet needs treatment this week. Elsewhere, an old basset hound is having surgery on its poorly eye, and a rhea – a flightless bird also known as a South American ostrich – has been attacked by dogs. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>The Great British Sewing Bee</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>It’s the semi-final, and a series of 1920s-inspired challenges suggest the producers think the world spent that decade engaged in upper-class sporting pursuits. First, contestants recreate golfing plus-fours, then polo shirts inspired by the tennis player René Lacoste’s invention of them, and finally it’s partywear. Tally ho!<em> Alexi Duggins</em></p> <h2>Casualty 24/7: Every Second Counts</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong><strong><br></strong>Another tense shift in the Barnsley A&amp;E department, starting with a 70-year-old struggling to breathe since holidaying in Tunisia. A fellow septuagenarian is also rushed in as she is bleeding heavily after a fall. And a 12-year-old boy has broken his hand. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Resident Alien</h2> <p><strong>10.05pm, Sky Max</strong><strong><br></strong>Now that flailing alien Harry is stuck in human form, this sci-fi comedy has settled into a Northern Exposure-style groove about life in a remote town full of eccentrics. With UFO stuff on the backburner, stressed nurse Asta tries to keep the family diner running smoothly while her father is away. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>The Old Man &amp; the Gun (David Lowery, 2018), 2.15am, Channel 4</strong></p>    <p>David Lowery is one of the most fascinating directors working today, flitting between Disney fare such as Pete’s Dragon and the hardcore arthouse of A Ghost Story. But with 2018’s The Old Man &amp; the Gun, he hit the exact midpoint between the two. Robert Redford plays Forrest Tucker, a career criminal whose string of heists enchants everyone around him, including the officers pursuing him. To date, The Old Man &amp; the Gun represents Redford’s last substantial film role. If it remains so, it’s the perfect way for him to go out. <em>Stuart Heritage</em></p>
