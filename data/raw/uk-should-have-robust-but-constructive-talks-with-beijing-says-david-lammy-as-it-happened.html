Demands on their time are arguably greater and more varied than they have ever been, with MPs balancing their roles as legislators with increased casework and constituency commitments.

She said that she had worked there as an economist, even though she was doing a management job. Given that she had worked as an economist at the Bank of England, and that she has a master’s degree in economics from the LSE, the controversy did not cause serious reputational damage because no one seriously argued that she was not qualified to be chancellor, or that she only got the job in the first place by over-stating her skills.</p> <p>Reeves was also critcised for saying at various points that she had spent a decade working at the Bank of England when in fact it was more like six years, including almost a year studying.</p> <p>The BBC has two new revelations.</p> <p>It has written<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c77r05nx11po"> a news story</a> saying that Reeves’ “online CV exaggerated how long she spent working at the Bank of England” because she had been there for even less time than previously acknowledged. The BBC says she left the bank in March 2006 not December 2006, as it said on her LinkedIn profile, meaning she only spent five and a half years at the bank, including almost a year at the LSE.</p> <p>This is just a slightly stronger version of one of the criticisms made last year. Reeves said a member of her team had put the dates on her LinkedIn profile, and that they had made a mistake.</p> <p>The second allegation is potentially more serious. But it is also contested by Reeves, and it relies on information from sources who mostly have not gone on the record, and the BBC has written it up as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg75jr5284o">an investigation feature</a>.</p> <p>It says that, when Reeves was working at HBOS, she and two other managers (one of whom was her immediate boss), were investigated over allegations of excessive expense claims.</p> <p>At the time HBOS managers could use a “motivation card” to pay for items to reward people for good work. They were meant to pay for items like flowers, or wine. The allegation is that Reeves and her colleagues used them to pay for items like birthday and Christmas presents when they were not meant to, and that they paid for items worth more than £25, which was the limit for some expenses. But the BBC report also suggests there was some uncertainty at HBOS about what exactly was allowed.</p> <p>According to the BBC, there definitely was an investigation.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We have learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Reeves and two other senior managers.</p> <p>A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the bank’s money to “fund a lifestyle” with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.</p> <p>We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded.</p> </blockquote> <p>A spokesperson for Reeves told the BBC that the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation when she was at HBOS, that she always complied with expenses rules and that she left the bank on good terms.</p> <p>In one respect, the story just implies that Reeves was a generous manager who may have been a bit free-and-easy with the company’s money. We’d all like a boss like that, and that happened a lot in the corporate world pre-financial crash, especially in banking. If Reeves was found to have deliberately broken the rules, that would be different. But she denies that, and the BBC is not directly making that claim.</p> <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> has posted a message <a href="https://x.com/KemiBadenoch/status/1890005253036322848">on social media</a> within the last hour claiming the investigation “raises serious questions” for Reeves and that she needs to come clean about the circumstances in which she left HBOS. But in the message Badenoch does not directly accuses Reeves of any wrongdoing.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The BBC’s investigation raises serious questions for Rachel Reeves.<br><br>Keir Starmer said “restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era”.<br><br>Until she comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-02-13T13:08:00.656Z">at 1.08pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-67add9078f0890d10a8969a8" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-02-13T11:50:33.777Z">11.50am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Eagle confirms UK still supports Ukraine joining Nato, even though Trump says that's not realistic</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>During the urgent question on Ukraine, <strong>Maria Eagle</strong>, the defence minister, said the UK remains committed to Ukraine joining Nato in the long term.</p> <p>Yesterday <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>, the US defence secretary, said: “The United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement.” <strong>President Trump</strong> said he agreed with Hegseth,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/12/trump-musk-modi-tariffs-usaid-us-politics-live-news?page=with:block-67ad17a28f08c271264e3161#block-67ad17a28f08c271264e3161"> adding</a>:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>[The Russians have] been saying that for a long time, that Ukraine cannot go into Nato, and I’m OK with that.</p> </blockquote> <p>In her reply to Johanna Baxter (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/13/new-towns-england-keir-starmer-angela-rayner-labour-donald-trump-ukraine-vladimir-putin-uk-politics-live-news?page=with:block-67add6f38f0890d10a896997#block-67add6f38f0890d10a896997">11.40am</a>), <strong>Eagle</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We’ve always said that Ukraine’s rightful place is in Nato, and our position is that Ukraine is on an irreversible path to Nato membership.

At PMQs yesterday <strong>Ed Davey</strong>, the Lib Dem leader, said that 80 years ago “British, Canadian and American soldiers were fighting shoulder to shoulder to defeat fascists” but that President Trump “seems to have forgotten all that” as he takes foreign policy decision.</p> <p>It turns out that Davey was wrong. <strong>Trump</strong> has a very strong sense of who was on America’s side during world war two. “We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations, and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II, remembering, that Russia lost tens of millions of people,” Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/12/ukraine-russia-eu-foreign-ministers-lammy-trump-hegseth-europe-live-news?page=with:block-67acd39a8f0890d10a89614e#block-67acd39a8f0890d10a89614e">said yesterday</a>, in his readout of his call with President Putin.</p> <p>That was the call with ominious implications for Ukraine, as America in effect <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth">called time</a> on the era when it used to guarantee the security of western Europe. Keir Starmer is doing a visit this morning and, as is normal at these events, he is expected to take brief questions from broadcasters on the main stories of the day. Stories don’t get any more “main” than this one.</p> <p>We will be covering the Starmer interviews here, but this is primarily an international story and <strong>Jakub Krupa</strong> is leading the coverage of it on his Europe live blog.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/13/ukraine-nato-hegseth-trump-putin-zelenskyy-europe-news-live">Trump-Putin call ‘not a betrayal’ of Ukraine, insists US’s Hegseth as he heads for Nato showdown – Europe live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starmer may also be asked about the economy, and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/13/uk-economy-grows-by-01-in-unexpected-boost-for-rachel-reeves">growth figures out this morning</a>, showing that the economy grew by a modest 0.1% in the final quarter of 2024. That’s not gangbusters territory, but it is an improvement on the previous quarter, when the economy was flat.
