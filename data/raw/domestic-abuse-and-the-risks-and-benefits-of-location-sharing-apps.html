<p>It was good to see the pros and cons&nbsp;of location tracking software being considered in your article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/24/inside-the-rise-of-couple-location-sharing">‘If I switch it off, my girlfriend might think I’m cheating’: inside the rise of couples location sharing, 24 July</a>).</p> <p>One thing that might usefully be added to the debate is a discussion on how <a href="https://www.emerald.com/jap/article-abstract/doi/10.1108/JAP-11-2024-0070/1251563/The-things-we-re-complaining-about-we-re-providing?redirectedFrom=fulltext">location tracking software has become “dual&nbsp;use</a>” in relation to technology-facilitated domestic abuse. The same technology that is used by abusers to exert control is also being used by victim-survivors&nbsp;to enhance their safety.</p> <p>For victim-survivors of domestic abuse, the risks of an abusive partner being able to track your every move are obvious.</p> <p>However, location sharing technologies can also serve a protective function by letting family and friends know where you&nbsp;are. Many domestic abuse support services and police forces are now recommending these technologies to victim-survivors as&nbsp;safeguarding measures.</p> <p>My advice to anyone would be not to share your location in the early months of a relationship. Wait&nbsp;until you really know and trust&nbsp;someone. Discuss the pros and cons with your partner.</p> <p>If your partner tries to pressurise you into sharing your location with them, consider asking for advice or support from local or national domestic abuse services. You can look for your local service <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/womens-aid-directory/">using the&nbsp;Women’s Aid directory</a>.<br><strong>Dr Kathryn Brookfield</strong><br><em>Assistant professor of criminology, University of Nottingham</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
