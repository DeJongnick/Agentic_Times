<p>Born in 1976, I am around the same age as Susanna Rustin and the generation of “middle-aged, gender-critical women” who believe that their biological sex should underpin and define their rights (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/05/generational-divide-views-sex-gender-britain">Why is there such a generational divide in views on sex and gender in Britain?, 5 June</a>). I am not one of those people. Forty-nine years’ experience of living in a female body in a world deformed by class, caste and economic and racial inequality – never mind environmental destruction – has only made me wonder quite why it matters so much to some people.</p> <p>A truly progressive society should be moving towards seeing the person first, both beyond and in profound recognition of their politicised identities. One can see biological sex as both fundamental and immaterial at the same time. As I approach 50, it’s clear to me that it’s possible to hold both these thoughts simultaneously. My menopausal womanhood matters as it gets in the way of things I want to do in life. But there’s no way it matters to me above all else, and there’s no chance it gets in the way to a greater degree than the various effects of social and economic inequality.</p> <p>It is a fallacy to suggest that trans inclusivity is more compatible with capitalism than with collective liberation. If the Progress Pride flag is flown from a corporate building – a rare sight in my experience compared with the rainbow Pride flag – it’s not because it “suits them”, in Rustin’s words, to shift attention away from class politics towards individual expression. Perhaps younger people better understand that corporate interests don’t engage with class politics anyway, so how’s a flag going to hurt anyone?</p> <p>I was born with breasts and ovaries, and still have them; I have given birth twice. These facts have had undeniable effects on my life –&nbsp;but so has the disadvantage of my class of birth and the continuing advantage of my whiteness. If I&nbsp;were to look at every aspect of my life through the prism of my reproductive organs, I would be limiting the possibilities of looking at the multiple effects of all those factors in the whole – the effects of which can only lead one to conclude that they are human, a person, first. It’s called intersectionality, and that term was come up with by Kimberlé Crenshaw, who was born in 1959. <br><strong>Lynsey Hanley</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>• Susanna Rustin lists several possibilities for why gen Z are more likely to advocate for the inclusion of transgender women in single-sex spaces. One thing she did not mention is that it may be due to the personal relationships that this demographic is more likely to have with transgender individuals, and how much more easily it is to sympathise with the struggles of those we know.</p> <p>As an older member of gen Z, I&nbsp;have had two openly trans peers in my cohort during my time at university, my former neighbour was transgender, and now in my workplace I have a transgender colleague. This resembles the norm – a Guardian article from June 2022 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/16/britons-not-bitterly-polarised-over-trans-equality-research-finds">suggests that 50% of British gen Zers said they knew at least one transgender person</a>. I would argue that gen Z more openly fights for the inclusion and protections of transgender women because we’re more likely to see them as truly women, rather than “self-identifying” individuals, due to our personal connections with them. To me, my trans female colleague would intrude on my bodily privacy the same amount as my cis female colleague would.</p> <p> As always, I implore others to seek out the voices and stories of transgender people if knowing them personally may be outside your generational demographic, so we can better empathise with this often scapegoated group.<br><strong>Mads Barker</strong><br><em>Camelford, Cornwall</em></p> <p>• Thank you for such a well-written and clearly argued article by Susanna Rustin. I am pleased to see the Guardian publishing this piece. It is very important to be able to speak openly about these important issues and engage in frank but respectful debate. I&nbsp;completely agree with the author and would also add that with age comes experience, a certain weariness, a generally more nuanced outlook on life and a deep understanding of how embodied our experiences are but also anger – anger that hard-won women’s rights, protections, dignity and safety can be so easily dismissed by&nbsp;so-called progressives.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong><br></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
