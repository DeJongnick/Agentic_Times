<h2>Henry on Anna</h2> 
<p><strong>What were you hoping for?<br></strong>To meet my person. But failing that, to have a warm and engaging evening with an interesting new acquaintance.</p> 
<p><strong>First impressions?<br></strong>Anna was smiley and chatty right away – I’m sure we were both a little nervous, but she put me at my ease.</p> 
<p><strong>What did you talk about?<br></strong>Glasgow v Edinburgh. BBC Radio 6 Music. Eating nachos in your jammies. We covered a lot of ground!</p> 
<p><strong>Most awkward moment?<br></strong>I did feel a little bad when Anna revealed she’d waited a year for a match. Thankfully, the organisers had convinced her that I wasn’t simply the only man in Scotland who had applied.</p> 
<p><strong>Good table manners?<br></strong>Perfect – Anna ate her first ever oyster with aplomb.</p> 
<p><strong>Best thing about Anna?<br></strong>Her openness. I never felt that any topic was dangerous, and the conversation flowed easily.</p>

    <p>Blind date is Saturday’s dating column: every week, two strangers are paired up for dinner and drinks, and then spill the beans to us, answering a set of questions. This runs, with a photograph we take of each dater before the date, in Saturday magazine (in the UK) and online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date">theguardian.com</a>&nbsp;every Saturday. It’s been running since 2009 – you can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/31/10-years-of-blind-date-weddings-babies-lost-knickers">read all about how we put it together here</a>.<br><br><b>What questions will I be asked?</b><br>We ask about age, location, occupation, hobbies, interests and the type of person you are looking to meet. If you do not think these questions cover everything you would like to know, tell us what’s on your mind.</p>
    <p><b>Can I choose who I match with?</b><br>No, it’s a blind date! But we do ask you a bit about your interests, preferences, etc – the more you tell us, the better the match is likely to be.</p>
    <p><b>Can I pick the photograph?</b><br>No, but don't worry: we'll choose the nicest ones.</p>
    <p><b>What personal details will appear?</b><br>Your first name, job and age.</p>
    <p><b>How should I answer?</b><br>Honestly but respectfully. Be mindful of how it will read to your date, and that Blind date reaches a large audience, in print and online.</p>
    <p><b>Will I see the other person’s answers?<br></b>No. We may edit yours and theirs for a range of reasons, including length, and we may ask you for more details.</p>
    <p><b>Will you find me The One?<br></b>We’ll try! Marriage! Babies!</p>
    <p><b>Can I do it in my home town?<br></b>Only if it’s in the UK. Many of our applicants live in London, but we would love to hear from people living elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Would you introduce Anna to your friends?<br></strong>Definitely. I’m sure she’d find plenty to talk about with almost anyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Describe Anna in three words<br></strong>Thoughtful, kind, curious.</p> 
<p><strong>What do you think Anna made of you?<br></strong>I hope she found me entertaining company.</p> 
<p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?<br></strong>We didn’t – we realised we’d been in the restaurant for four hours and that I should go and catch my train home.</p> 
<p><strong>And … did you kiss?<br></strong>We shared a goodbye hug.</p> 
<p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?<br></strong>Maybe to feel more romantic spark, but that doesn’t always develop immediately.</p> 
<p><strong>Marks out of 10?<br></strong>A strong 8.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you meet again?<br></strong>Yes – we swapped numbers.</p> 
<h2>Anna on Henry</h2> 
<p><strong>What were you hoping for?<br></strong>Good company, tasty food (oh, and meeting “the one”).</p> 
<p><strong>First impressions?<br></strong>Henry was very warm and smiley.</p> 
<p><strong>What did you talk about?<br></strong>Films, music, divorce, food, travel, cats and work-life balance.</p> 
<p><strong>Most awkward moment? <br></strong>Tackling my first ever oyster covered in crumbs felt like a challenge on a first date … luckily it was delicious.</p> 
<p><strong>Good table manners?<br></strong>Impeccable.</p> 
<p><strong>Best thing about Henry?<br></strong>His openness and open-mindedness.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you introduce Henry to your friends?<br></strong>Yes.</p> 
<p><strong>Describe Henry in three words<br></strong>Friendly, intelligent, kind.</p> 
<p><strong>What do you think Henry made of you?<br></strong>Hmm … I think he enjoyed my company, but possibly thought I was a bit intense?! (I blame the nerves.)</p> 
<p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?<br></strong>No.</p> 
<p><strong>And … did you kiss?<br></strong>No … but he did take my number.</p> 
<p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?<br></strong>When we were sitting under a huge circular spotlight and I said it felt like I was going for a smear test.</p> 
<p><strong>Marks out of 10?<br></strong>9.5</p> 
<p><strong>Would you meet again?<br></strong>It’s on the cards – not sure if it will be as more than friends though …</p>
