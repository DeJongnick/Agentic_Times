<p>Abi Stephenson’s article about hyperemesis gravidarum – “extreme morning sickness” – carried me through memories, confirmation, horror and, at last, hope (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/31/dont-call-it-morning-sickness-hyperemesis-gravidarum-extreme-pregnancy">Don’t call it morning sickness: ‘At times in my pregnancy I wondered if this was death coming for me’, 31 July</a>).</p> <p>When I hear of a new pregnancy,&nbsp;I ask after the mother, recalling my two pregnancies in the early 1990s. Both ended with successful delivery, and I can’t imagine life without my two children. But I wonder whether my daughter will have inherited my predisposition to sickness throughout pregnancy, just as I&nbsp;did&nbsp;from my own mother.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/01/the-harsh-reality-of-extreme-morning-sickness">The harsh reality of ‘extreme morning sickness’ | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is wonderful news to think there might be some safe medical option for her and many other women. I had many miserable days&nbsp;and nights with sick bowl to hand, eating one Rice Krispie every&nbsp;30 minutes and always, always, throwing it back up. I&nbsp;theorised that a morsel of sugary&nbsp;goodness would get through, somehow. For my second&nbsp;pregnancy, under pressure&nbsp;to return to work after six&nbsp;weeks’ sick&nbsp;leave, I spent a morning in the&nbsp;staff toilet before being allowed home again for another month.</p> <p>The nausea and vomiting started before a positive pregnancy test and ended within hours of giving birth. It took a lot of persuasion for me to embark on a second pregnancy and I’ve never regretted it, but memories soon fade.</p> <p>Since then I’ve had chemotherapy, which made me so&nbsp;sick that I required all the anti‑nausea&nbsp;drugs on offer. But being pregnant was worse, maybe because I hadn’t anticipated fighting to stay alive as part of the&nbsp;deal. Thanks, Abi, for giving voice to an issue that affects many of us, and causes women to die while pregnant – yet is ignored.<br><strong>Dr Wendy Bryant</strong><br><em>Chappel, Essex</em></p> <p><em><strong>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
