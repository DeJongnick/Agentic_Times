<p>The UK is falling behind on international efforts to tackle microplastics, scientists have said, as the pollutants continue to infiltrate food, ecosystems and human bodies.</p> <p>The tiny fragments of plastic have been found in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/20/microplastics-human-testicles-study-sperm-counts">human testicles</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/03/levels-of-microplastics-in-human-brains-may-be-rapidly-rising-study-suggests">brains</a>, and they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/10/microplastics-hinder-plant-photosynthesis-study-finds-threatening-millions-with-starvation">burrow into plants</a>, inhibiting their ability to photosynthesise.

Its diffuse sources and persistence across ecosystems call for a coordinated and forward-looking response.</p> <p>“The fact that the evidence is still emerging should not be a reason to delay action. A national roadmap informed by international developments is not only timely but necessary to ensure policy coherence and future readiness.”</p> <p>The scientists have recommended that the government sets up a roadmap with measurable targets and timelines to tackle the microplastic problem. They are also calling for interventions in high-emission sectors such as agriculture. Sewage sludge that contains high concentrations of microplastics is spread on fields as fertiliser, and plastic-based mulching is contributing to widespread soil contamination.</p> <p>At the moment, there is a ban in the UK on cosmetic products that use microbeads, but the scientists said these tiny plastics need to be recognised and designed out of products beyond this, including setting design standards for clothing and other textiles so they shed less.</p> <p>Prof Fay Couceiro, from the microplastics research group at the University of Portsmouth said: “Microplastic pollution is an escalating threat with potentially irreversible consequences. Without decisive action, the UK’s environment and global leadership will be compromised, with potential impacts to public health. Implementing a robust, forward-looking microplastic policy framework is urgent and essential to protect us, our environment and the economy.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “For too long, plastic has littered our rivers and oceans and threatened our wildlife.<br><br>“This must change. We are taking action to clean up our waterways to make sure it works for people and the environment.”</p>
