<p>The federal trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs entered its eighth day of testimony in New York on Wednesday, with a homeland security agent resuming testimony about the federal raid of Combs’s Miami property last year.</p> <p>Combs, 55, is facing charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. He was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/17/sean-diddy-combs-arrest-new-york-grand-jury-indictment-ntwnfb">arrested in September</a> and has pleaded not guilty.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, Gerard Gannon, an agent with Homeland Security Investigations who oversaw the March 2024 search of Combs’s Miami Beach home, took the stand for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/20/diddy-trial-assistant-cassie-ventura">the second time</a> this week.</p> <p>Gannon told the court on Tuesday that agents discovered AR-15 rifle parts, high heels, sex toys, lubricants, baby oil and lingerie in the closet of the main bedroom of Combs’s Miami home.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Gannon recalled that agents found a Gucci bag containing an assortment of pills including MDMA tablets, as well as white residue that tested positive for cocaine and ketamine, and other items in a different closet in Combs’s home.</p> <p>Photos shown in court were of items that agents said were found in a hallway closet, including more than 20 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.</p> <p>Gannon testified that agents found a loaded .45 caliber handgun in a suitcase in the guesthouse on the property.</p> <p>Under cross-examination, Gannon said the AR-15-style guns found in Combs’s home were disassembled and thus inoperable.</p> <p>The prosecution then called Dr Dawn Hughes, a forensic and clinical psychologist who specializes in trauma. Hughes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/03/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-attorneys-rest">previously testified during the 2022 defamation case</a> of actors Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.</p> <p>Hughes testified that it was common for victims to remain in abusive relationships because they often feel trapped and that it can take months, or even years, before a victim is able to disclose the abuse to anybody. Trauma victims, she said, typically experience deep feelings of shame, humiliation and degradation.</p> <p>“They don’t want to talk about it,” Hughes said. “They don’t even want to think about it in their own brain.”</p> <p>In abusive relationships, Hughes said there is “almost always love” which creates “an intense psychological bond that creates an attachment with their abuser”.</p> <p>It often takes multiple attempts for victims to leave abusive relationships, Hughes said, before describing a cycle of “returning, and reconciliation, and then returning again” as a common pattern in abusive relationships.</p> <p>In tandem with physical violence, Hughes said abusers frequently use financial control to maintain power and make victims feel trapped. Victims often use drugs and repress memories, she said.</p> <p>Hughes told the court that she was paid $600 an hour for her work as an expert witness and $6,000 for a day of testimony in court.</p> <p>During cross-examination, Combs’s lawyers tried to paint Hughes as a biased expert witness who is being paid by the prosecution.</p> <p>On the stand, Hughes confirmed that she’s never testified in defense of someone accused of a sex crime, explaining to the court that she doesn’t “evaluate offenders”.</p> <p>After Hughes, the government called George Kaplan, a former assistant to Combs, to the witness stand.</p> <p>Kaplan said that he started working for Combs Enterprises in 2013 and that he was promoted in less than a year to Combs’s executive assistant.</p> <p>Kaplan testified that Combs would frequently threaten to fire him, and would say that he only wanted the best employees.</p> <p>Kaplan said that he communicated with Combs daily, and often prepared hotel rooms for him, stocking them with clothes, candles, lubricant, baby oil and more, and would clean them afterward.</p> <p>Kaplan told the court that “protecting” Combs’s public image was “very important”.</p> <p>Court adjourned at about 3pm ET. Kaplan will continue testifying on Thursday morning.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the jury heard from<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/20/diddy-trial-assistant-cassie-ventura"> a former assistant to Combs, a male escort and Cassie Ventura’s mother, Regina Ventura</a>, who accused him of blackmail and of assaulting her daughter.</p> <p>On Monday, the jury heard from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/19/diddy-trial-dawn-richard-testimony">singer Dawn Richard</a> and Kerry Morgan, a former close friend of Ventura’s during her relationship with Combs. Both women <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/19/diddy-trial-dawn-richard-testimony">testified that they had witnessed</a> Combs assaulting Ventura.</p> <p>Cassie Ventura spent four days on the stand last week, and testified about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/14/cassie-ventura-sean-diddy-combs-trial">years of physical and emotional abuse</a> she endured from Combs during their 11-year on-again, off-again relationship.</p> <p>Ventura said Combs orchestrated drug-fueled sex performances with male sex workers that he called “freak-offs”, and that he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/14/cassie-ventura-sean-diddy-combs-trial">coerced and blackmailed</a> her into participating.</p> <p>She also alleged that Combs raped her in 2018 after their breakup.</p> <p>Prosecutors have sought to portray Combs as controlling and abusive, and as someone who exerted power over nearly every aspect of Ventura’s life and decisions.</p> <p>Attorneys for Combs have tried to undermine Ventura’s credibility and sought to depict her as a willing and consenting participant in the so-called “freak-offs”.</p> <p>The trial is expected to last seven more weeks. If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>
