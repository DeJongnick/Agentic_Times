<p>Morning, everyone. Donald Trump says his planned tariffs on Canada and Mexico will begin on Tuesday, despite opponents saying they would “drive the US economy straight into a wall”. We have full reports, plus how the UK prime minister played his ace card on a trip to Washington.</p> 
<p>At home the Greens and teals are being targeted by third-party groups in the lead-up to the election, Choice names and shames the most expensive insurers, and Hollywood is mourning one of the all-time great actors after Gene Hackman died with his wife under what police are calling “suspicious” circumstances.</p>
