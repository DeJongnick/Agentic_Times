<p>The Queensland government plans to repeal a requirement that half the board overseeing the organising of the Brisbane Olympics be women and at least one member Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.</p> <p>The change to the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG) board is contained in an obscure clause <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/01/queensland-moves-to-crack-down-on-windfarms-and-exempt-olympic-venues-from-planning-laws">in broad-ranging legislation</a> sponsored by the deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, in May. It is not mentioned in either its explanatory speech or explanatory notes.</p> <p>According to a written briefing by the Department of State Development, Infrastructure and Planning, made during consideration by a parliamentary committee, the bill would “enhance efficiency and effectiveness” by “removing certain requirements for the appointment of OCOG board directors”.</p> <p>That includes “that 50% of nominated directors be women” and “that at least one of the independent directors is Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander”.</p> <p>The bill has yet to pass parliament but is certain to do so if all government members vote for it.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/20/consent-education-is-too-important-to-become-a-schoolyard-joke">Renee Carr</a>, the executive director of Fair Agenda, said “women should be an equal part of making the critical decisions that shape its legacy”.</p> <p>“There’s been important progress in recognising women’s contribution to sport – as athletes, coaches, and in leadership. We should be leaning into what’s possible, not going backwards,” she said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/01/queensland-moves-to-crack-down-on-windfarms-and-exempt-olympic-venues-from-planning-laws">Queensland moves to crack down on windfarms and exempt Olympic venues from planning laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Hosting an event of this scale will impact Queensland’s economy, infrastructure and tourism. Women’s voices and expertise must be an equal part of planning a games that delivers for the whole community.”</p> <p>The executive director of QUT’s Carumba Institute,<strong> </strong>Prof Chelsea Watego, said the plan to remove the requirement was an “appalling decision”.</p> <p>She said the Sydney Olympics was able to make decisions with a board that included an Indigenous representative, Lowitja O’Donoghue, so there was no case that excluding them would make it more efficient.</p> <p>“It just tells you how far backwards Queensland has gone under an LNP government,” she said.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Watego said that Brisbane, Queensland and Australia would be on the international stage.</p> <p>“We’re under a microscope and we have to think very seriously about what this tells the world about who we are as a nation, who we are as a state, and the location of Indigenous peoples and women in relation to that.”</p> <p>The minister for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Tim Mander, said: “The Crisafulli government has accepted the recommendation of the independent 100-day review of the Games to streamline governance arrangements.</p> <p>“The act is currently before the state development, infrastructure and works committee.”</p> <p>The Planning (Social Impact and Community Benefit) and Other Legislation Amendment bill 2025 has a wide-ranging scope and more than 700 individuals and groups made a submission during a parliamentary inquiry process.</p> <p>Among other changes, the bill will reduce the size of <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/brisbane-2032/the-committee/board/">the OCOG board from 24 to 15</a>.</p> <p>It also amends regulation of renewables projects to make them easier for opponents to challenge in court and exempts Olympic venues from legal challenge.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/02/mark-arbib-aoc-australian-olympic-committee-ceo-brisbane-olympics-2032-games">AOC appoints Mark Arbib as CEO for run-in to 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The OCOG board is appointed by multiple different agencies separate from the state government, such as the federal sports minister and the president of the Australian Olympic Committee.</p> <p>A legal provision will still apply requiring consideration of the state government’s policy on gender equity on boards. The policy sets a non-binding target for gender equity and does not cover Indigenous representation.</p> <p>The Brisbane Olympics will be held from 23 July to 8 August 2032, with the Paralympics running from 24 August to 5 September. Queensland has never held an Olympics but has hosted the Commonwealth Games, most recently in 2018.</p> <p>A binding provision that the 2032 games be “climate positive” has also been <a href="https://theconversation.com/brisbane-2032-is-no-longer-legally-bound-to-be-climate-positive-will-it-still-leave-a-green-legacy-246672">reportedly removed from the Olympic host contract</a>. It will now aim “at removing more carbon from the atmosphere than what the Games project emits”.</p>
