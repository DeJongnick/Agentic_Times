<p>Earlier today I set these three puzzles, loosely based around 1729, the “taxicab number”. To read about the link between London cabs and 1729 please read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/13/can-you-solve-it-the-london-cab-that-rode-into-history">the original post</a>.</p> <p><strong>1. Square pair</strong></p> <p>What is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of a pair of squares in two different ways? Hint: it is less than 100</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>1<sup>2</sup> + 7<sup>2 </sup>= 5<sup>2 </sup>+ 5<sup>2 </sup>= 50</p> <p><strong>2. Strip tease</strong></p> <p>I have five strips of wood with lengths 1, 2, 7, 17 and 29 centimetres. It is impossible to arrange any three of these strips into a triangle. I would like to add another strip of wood, of maximum length 29cm, so that I still cannot take three strips and make a triangle.</p> <p>How many different lengths are possible for the seventh strip, and what are they? Lengths must be a whole number of centimetres. As a bonus, what shape can I make using only these hypothetical extra strips?</p> <p>CORRECTION: Previously this question had the length 9. That was a mistake. Also, no two lengths can be the same.</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong> 3, 4 and 5</p> <p>In a triangle, the sum of the two smaller sides need to be larger the longest side. You can make a right-angled triangle with sides of length 3, 4 and 5.</p> <p><strong>3. Sick sixth</strong></p> <p>I have four numbers, <em>a, b, c, </em>and<em> d. </em>They may be whole numbers, or fractions.</p> <p>There are six ways to multiply two of these numbers together: <em>ab, cd, ac, bd, ad, bc.</em></p> <p>The values of five of these products, but not necessarily in this order, are 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.</p> <p>What is the value of the sixth product?</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong> 2.4</p> <p>If we multiply <em>ab </em>x <em>cd </em>or <em>ac </em>x<em> bd </em>or <em>ad </em>x<em> bc </em>we get <em>abcd.</em></p> <p>Thus there must be two pairs from 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 whose product is the same.</p> <p>The only possibility is 2 x 6 = 3 x 4 = 12. The sixth product x 5 = 12.</p> <p><em>Thanks to George Watkins for today’s puzzles.</em></p> <p><em>I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015.
