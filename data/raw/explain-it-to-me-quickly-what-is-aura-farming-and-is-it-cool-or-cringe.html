<p><strong>Bertin and Luca. You’re young people. Why are all the kids on my feeds suddenly talking about aura farming, and what does it have to do with Timothée Chalamet?</strong></p> <p>Who has more aura than the<strong> </strong>Dune saga’s prophesied leader<strong> </strong>Paul Atreides? Since that role, Chalamet has become one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Aura farming is all about cultivating the coolest version of yourself. Think well-tailored suits, lots of grayscale, serious stares and sharp angles.</p> <p>When Chalamet, playing Atreides, leads an army of hardened warriors <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/03/dune-part-two-review-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-zendaya-rebecca-ferguson-austin-butler-sci-fi-sequel-is-jaw-on-the-floor-spectacular">in the sci-fi blockbuster,</a> delivering a powerful speech and declares himself emperor of the known universe, he’s aura farming. </p> <p>Kids have always wanted to be cool – now they get to farm for it.</p> <p><strong>I’m guessing this farming does not involve a tractor. How exactly does one do it?</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/may/31/my-cultural-awakening-timothee-chalamet-film-beautiful-boy">My cultural awakening: a Timothée Chalamet drama made me leave my partner – and check him into rehab</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the simple act of being cool or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@user27839993889338938292/video/7488063189121305861?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-8wwcNehrE8O">mysterious</a>: striking a cool pose, or performing great feats of coolness – a strike when you go bowling, flawlessly landing rubbish in the bin from 5 metres away, or completing a new personal best at the gym.</p> <p><strong>OK, so aura farming is the same as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/22/aura-points-tiktok-ethics-rizz">earning aura points</a>. But </strong><em><strong>why </strong></em><strong>is it farming?</strong></p> <p>Like so much Gen Z and Alpha slang, it emerges when the world of video games and anime collides with TikTok.</p> <p>In many video games, to farm is to endlessly grind at a digital task to gain experience, currency or items (wow, art imitating life). Some examples – such as World of Warcraft or more recently, Fortnite – are notorious for sucking hours, days, maybe even months from people’s lives as they farm in pursuit of these things.</p> <p>TikTokers count the aura points earned when they do something cool; players of games like Elden Ring farm aura by performing spectacular game play moves, or standing against a backdrop of cool scenery and wearing all their their cool gear – to share with viewers on a stream, or social media followers, or just for their own satisfaction.</p> <p>Just as there are video game streamers and entire YouTube channels dedicated to playing a game quickly or skilfully, there are others devoted to mastering the art of playing stylishly and smoothly.</p> <p>Of course these worlds were going to cross over.</p> <p><strong>Back in my day, spending hours playing video games wasn’t exactly cool …</strong></p> <p>If the number of television adaptations of video games are any indication, maybe the definition of cool has changed.</p> <p>But you do have a point. Aura farming refers to a sense of cool that is very specific to video games and anime. The most famous examples of aura farmers – you could<strong> </strong>start with Piccolo, Gon, Sangwoo, to name a few – all come from that world.</p> <p><strong>Can you aura farm in real life?</strong></p> <p>Yes. There’s always riding your bike with hands in your pockets down the main street of your university campus.</p> <p>Or pretending to be so famous that people want your autograph. On election day in Australia, one dedicated aura farmer walked past polling booths <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@deangrimaldi/video/7499753231959035154?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-8wwcX72rkdG">signing how to vote cards</a> as if he were a celebrity – a riff on the existing trend of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@djfashionkill/video/7492100190883810606?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-8wwcVeKuGAS">autographing receipts</a> and pieces of paper <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@djfashionkill/video/7506591656880246062">you dropped in front of celebrities on purpose</a>.</p> <p><strong>This doesn’t sound that cool, honestly.</strong></p> <p>The main difference between aura farming in a game and in real life is that if you’re doing the latter, you’re running the risk you’ll be made fun of.</p> <p>Where there is cool, there is also cringe. They are two sides of the same coin. And trying too hard to aura farm is not cool.</p> <p>If someone from Gen Alpha or Z says you’re aura farming, pay attention to the tone. If it’s accusatory, they’re mocking you. If they’re laughing, they’re mocking you.</p> <p>Just hope that if someone says it to you, it’s in sheer awe of your presence … and aura.</p> <p><strong>OK, so to put it in terms my calcified </strong><strong>millennial</strong><strong> mind can understand, that time I saw Chloë Sevigny smoking on the dancefloor at a New York fashion week party, she was aura farming in the cool way. But then when my friend lit a cigarette right afterward and we were told it was a no-smoking venue, we were aura farming in the cringe way?</strong></p> <p>You’re aura farming just by telling that story.</p>
