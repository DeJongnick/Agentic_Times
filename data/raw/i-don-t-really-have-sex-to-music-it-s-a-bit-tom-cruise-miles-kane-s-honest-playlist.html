<p><strong>The song I do at karaoke</strong><br>I don’t like karaoke, but if I’d had a few vodkas, I’d go for My Way by Frank Sinatra and absolutely smash it. I&nbsp;love the lyrics: “Regrets, I’ve had a few /&nbsp;But then again, too few to mention.” You know it’s going to be a crowd pleaser. I like the Robbie Williams version as well.</p> <p><strong>The best song to play at a party</strong><br>Whenever I have people around, I’ll put on some Motown. It takes me back to family parties where my nan and mum would be dancing. Can’t Help Myself by the Four Tops is a great feeling of coming together. If you were wanting to feng shui the air&nbsp;in a room, a&nbsp;bar or a club, Motown makes you feel good.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToQ0n3itoII"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ToQ0n3itoII?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>The first song I fell in love with</strong><br>The Drugs Don’t Work by the Verve. It has such dark lyrics, but such a sing-along tune, and makes me feel real emotion.</p> <p><strong>The song that changed my life</strong><br>Get It On by T Rex has got that perfect mix of glam, lad and camp. There’s just something about the way Marc Bolan performs, and sings the sexiness of it. It makes you want to move, but the way he sings is so muted and understated. It’s still the most badass rock’n’roll tune ever.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kmEEkECFQw"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7kmEEkECFQw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>The first single I bought</strong><br>No Limit by 2 Unlimited, on cassette single, from Woolworths or HMV in Liverpool.</p> <p><strong>The song I secretly like&nbsp;but tell everyone I&nbsp;hate</strong><br>Because I Got High by Afroman, which is another one from my childhood. I don’t know why that comes to mind. I was just going off instinct and that is what&nbsp;came into my head&nbsp;first. You must think I’m mental!</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOWpy4mOsdA"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kOWpy4mOsdA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>The song that makes me cry</strong><br>I’ve definitely had moments when I’ve cried to For Your Lover, Give Some Time by Richard Hawley, because I’ve been going through a rough time, or a breakup or whatever. I think those lyrics are so relatable, so true. I’ve definitely had a moment like that on my own.</p> <p><strong>The best song to have sex to</strong><br>I don’t really do that. Have I ever tried any of my music? No, I haven’t. I feel it’s all a bit Tom Cruise, do you know what I mean? But don’t tempt me!</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaeLKhRnkhQ"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SaeLKhRnkhQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>The song I inexplicably know every lyric to</strong><br>I got the Oasis …There and Then VHS for Christmas when I was 11, so I’m going to say Cigarettes and Alcohol.</p> <p><strong>The song I’d like played at my funeral</strong><br>The Good Life by Billy Joel and Tony Bennett.</p> <p><em>Miles Kane’s new album </em><em>Sunlight </em><em>in </em><em>the Shadows</em><em> is </em><em>out now</em><em>.</em></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="miles kane">  <iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2jr3PbKigWeAL0eyBxGSAf?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe> </figure>
