<h2>The Jury Australia: Death on the Staircase</h2> <p><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>“I am a massive Judge Judy fan to be completely honest.” That’s Michael, one of the 12 people taking part in this Australian version of the hit jury simulation show. Others include a former prison guard who never questioned inmates’ guilt and a member of Mensa. They watch actors stage a real manslaughter case – word-for-word from transcripts – and must deliver their own verdict at the end. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Our Lives: The Film I’ll Never See</h2> <p><strong>7.30pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>Dave Steele is a spoken-word artist with retinitis pigmentosa who is also known as the Blind Poet. This short film follows him as he explores the impact his condition has on his family, capturing his resilient spirit. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Mahler’s Fifth at the Proms</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC Four</strong></p> <p>“Nobody understood it,” lamented Gustav of his glorious Fifth Symphony. “I wish I could conduct the first performance 50 years after my death.” In lieu of that, here’s Finnish conductor Klaus Mäkelä rising to the challenge. It goes without saying that the Adagietto is one of the most astonishing 10 minutes in musical history. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Here We Go</h2>    <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>The third series of this comedy about the Jessop family rolls on with a holiday to Malta – and tension ensues. Amy wants to go out on the town, Robin wants to scuba dive, Cherry wants to chill, Paul wants to deep dive into history and Rachel fancies that classic holiday activity: wading into long-standing grievances. <em>Alexi Duggins</em></p> <h2>Miriam Margolyes Discovers New Zealand</h2>    <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong></p> <p>It’s the second and concluding part of the eccentric actor’s tour of the country– and of course she meets up with an organised crime gang member. She ends with a trip to the South Island, where she connects with a landscape that conjures every emotion. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Peacemaker</h2> <p><strong>10pm, Sky Max</strong></p> <p>Things are not going great for would-be superhero Peacemaker (John Cena): his recent cocaine-fuelled orgy has left him with lots to clean up, including a dead body. To make things worse, shady government outfit Argus has assigned an eccentric agent named Langston Fleury (Tim Meadows) to surveil him. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Film Choice</h2> <p><strong>The Driller Killer</strong>, <strong>10.10pm, Talking Pictures TV</strong></p> <p>Unfairly drawn into the “video nasties” furore of the early 1980s, Abel Ferrara’s low-budget thriller is actually relatively restrained in its blood-letting. Troubled painter Reno (Ferrara himself) only starts losing his grip on reality – taking up his battery-operated drill to attack homeless men – late on in a drama more interested in the hard-scrabble life of the marginalised and the mentally ill in a crime-ridden New York. From the down-and-outs on the streets to the punk band rehearsing next door, it’s a time capsule of the late-70s city. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p>
