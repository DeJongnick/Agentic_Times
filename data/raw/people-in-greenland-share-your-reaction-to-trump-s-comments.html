<p>During a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, the incoming US president Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/07/trump-panama-canal-greenland">refused to rule out using American military force to seize Greenland</a>. He also threatened economic retaliation against Denmark, noting that if that country resisted his territorial ambitions for Greenland he “would tariff Denmark at a very high level”.</p> <p>“I can’t assure you,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question. “But I can say this, we need them [the Panama Canal and Greenland] for economic security.”</p> <p>We would like to hear your reaction to what Trump has said about Greenland. What do you think of his territorial ambitions?</p> <p><strong>This Community callout closed on 5 February 2025.</strong></p> <p>• You can see the article that included respondents to this callout <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/10/greenland-views-donald-trump-advances">here</a>.</strong></p> <p>• You can contribute to open Community callouts <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-community-team">here</a> or Share a story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/sep/02/guardianwitness-send-us-a-story">here</a>.</strong></p>
