<p>Texas <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> said on Thursday they are prepared to return to the state under certain conditions, ending a nearly two-week-long effort to block <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> from passing a new congressional map that would add five GOP seats.</p> <p>The lawmakers said they would return as long as the legislature ends its first special session on Friday, which Republicans have said they plan to do. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a>’s governor, Greg Abbott, has said he will immediately call another special session.</p> <p>The Democrats also said they would return once California introduces a new congressional map that would add five Democratic seats, offsetting the gains in Texas. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, is expected to announce what he has teased as a “major” redistricting announcement on Thursday.</p> <p>Gene Wu, chair of the Texas house Democratic caucus, said in a statement that he and his colleagues “successfully mobilized the nation against Trump’s assault on minority voting rights”.</p> <p>“Facing threats of arrest, lawfare, financial penalties, harassment and bomb threats, we have stood firm in our fight against a proposed Jim Crow congressional district map,” he said. “Now, as Democrats across the nation join our fight to cause these maps to fail their political purpose, we’re prepared to bring this battle back to Texas under the right conditions and to take this fight to the courts.”</p> <p>The lawmakers said in a statement that returning to Texas would allow them to build a strong public and legislative record that could be used in legal challenges against the map.</p>
