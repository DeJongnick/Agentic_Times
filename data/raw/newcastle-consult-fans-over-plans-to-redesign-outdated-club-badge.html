<p>Newcastle have risked upsetting some supporters by announcing plans to redesign the club’s badge for the 2026-27 season.</p> <p>With St James’ Park executives deciding the crest, that dates back to 1988, is overly elaborate and unsuited to global digital branding requirements, Newcastle are working with designers and consulting fans as they begin rebranding a symbol they believe has become outdated.</p> <p>The new image will be the fourth crest Newcastle have worn since the 1950s. The current badge features the city’s original coat of arms.</p> <p>Its disappearance will sadden supporters. The two seahorses on a coat of arms also containing a lion sitting atop a castle turret and bearing the flag of St George are redolent of the city’s seafaring and defensive traditions.</p> <p>“As our club grows on the global stage, the symbol that represents us needs to be able to keep pace,” the club said in an email to supporters on Friday, when Newcastle officials emphasised that a week-long consultation process would involve fans submitting their preferences regarding the new badge before being allowed to vote for one of a number of options. “It needs to show up clearly and confidently across everything from kits to screens to merchandise.</p> <p>“It’s time to update our crest. This isn’t a decision we take lightly. We love our crest. It’s iconic and has stood us through unforgettable triumphs and testing times. But it was created in a different era. It’s intricate design doesn’t always translate well in today’s digital world. And it’s difficult to reproduce it clearly and consistently. As football and the world changes so, too, must the symbol that unites us.”</p> <p>The club’s fan advisory board has been consulted and reassured that radical changes are unlikely. “Refine and revive is our recommended approach,” said Friday’s email to supporters. It is understood visual references to Saudi Arabia, home of Newcastle’s ownership, are highly unlikely to form any part of the design.</p>
