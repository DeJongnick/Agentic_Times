<p>Australians in capital cities will enjoy warm and sunny conditions over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/easter">Easter</a> long weekend – at least to start – before a cold front moves through the south-east, delivering rain and cooler weather.</p> <p>Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Hobart are all forecast to experience fine weather on Good Friday, with above average temperatures.</p> <p>“The Easter long weekend should start off on pretty good footing,” said Angus Hines, a meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology.</p> <p>“We’ll have some fairly warm weather with temperatures several degrees above average to begin the long weekend … staying several degrees above average through New South Wales for the majority of the long weekend.”</p> <p>In Sydney, the warmest day is expected to be Easter Sunday, with a forecast high of 29C.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>While NSW is tipped to enjoy consistent warmth and sunshine, Hines said southern states would face a shift in conditions. A cold front is expected to move through on Saturday, bringing cloud, cooler temperatures and showers to Melbourne, Adelaide and Hobart.</p> <p>Melbourne is forecast to reach the high 20s on Friday before falling to 19C by Sunday—a “big shift in temperature,” Hines said.</p> <p>Adelaide is forecast to hit 30C on Friday, before rain and lower temperatures arrive later in the weekend. Hobart is expected to reach 25C on Friday, dropping to 18C by Sunday.</p> <p>“We certainly could see some moderate rainfall totals across south-eastern Australia, particularly during Easter Sunday and Monday,” Hines added.</p> <p>The wet weather is likely to reach Sydney and eastern New South Wales later in the weekend, with a “gradual weather shift” expected on Sunday or Monday.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/15/us-sees-biggest-drop-in-australian-visitors-since-covid-as-travellers-avoid-trumps-america">US sees biggest drop in Australian visitors since Covid as travellers avoid Trump’s America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In contrast, Queenslanders can expect a typically sunny Easter, with Brisbane forecast to enjoy clear skies and warm conditions throughout the long weekend.</p> <p>Western Australia will also see mostly sunny weather. Perth is expected to stay fine, though with some temperature fluctuations. In Canberra, Saturday is forecast to be the warmest day, reaching 26C.</p> <p>A large weather system in the Tasman Sea is expected to generate significant surf conditions along the east coast from Thursday through to Sunday.
