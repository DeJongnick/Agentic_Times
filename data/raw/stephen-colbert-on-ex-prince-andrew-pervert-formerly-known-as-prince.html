He joked that “sometimes you go so far right you come out on the other side”.</p> <p>Her annoyance over the situation and with some of Trump’s decisions has led to pushback from Ted Cruz. “It feels like Jurassic Park when the velociraptors turn on the guys running the place,” Kimmel said.</p> <p>He also added that Cruz “can go trick or treating without a mask”.</p> <h2><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coke6nvWs30"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Coke6nvWs30?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers also spoke about Trump’s trip to parts of Asia, which rightwing media has branded “a resounding success”.</p> <p>He played a clip of a Fox News pundit complimenting his handshake with Xi Jinping, saying it clearly showed who owned the room.</p> <p>“No one in American history has been worse at handshakes than Donald Trump,” Meyers said in response, noting that there is an entire Wikipedia article titled Donald Trump and handshakes.</p> <p>After Chuck Schumer called the trip “a total dud”, Trump claimed it was “almost treasonous” to use such words. Meyers joked that “the real treason is when your detractors get sassy”.</p> <p>Meyers also said that Trump “likes going abroad” because “here at home everyone’s mad at him”.</p>
