<p>The first woman to lead the US naval academy is being reassigned, with the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, moving to replace her with a Marine Corps general, defense officials confirmed on Friday.</p> 
<p>The decision marks the first time in the nearly 180-year history of the academy that a Marine Corps officer has been nominated to take charge.</p> 
<p>Yvette Davids, who assumed leadership of the academy in January 2024, is being succeeded by Michael Borgschulte, currently responsible for Marine Corps personnel as the deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs based in Quantico, Virginia, according to a Friday <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4249504/secretary-of-defense-general-and-flag-officer-announcements-for-july-18-2025/">press release</a> from the defense department.</p> 
<p>A Pentagon official, speaking anonymously to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/07/18/yvette-davids-naval-academy-hegseth/">Washington Post</a>, said that the move was not a dismissal. Davids has been nominated for a senior position on the staff of the chief of naval operations following her roughly 18 months as head of the academy. The defense department confirmed the nomination in <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4249768/statements-regarding-defense-secretary-announcement-of-presidential-nominations/">a statement</a> on Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>If confirmed by the Senate, she would take over from retiring V Adm Daniel Dwyer as the deputy chief of naval operations overseeing strategy, operations, planning, and combat development.</p> 
<p>“I’m honored to be nominated as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Operations, Plans, Strategy, and Warfighting Development. I look forward to continuing to serve alongside America’s strongest warfighters,” Davids said in the statement.</p> 
<p>The Trump administration has removed several high-ranking military officials, many of them women or people of color, as part of an effort to eliminate what officials describe as “wokeness” in the ranks.</p> 
<p>This list includes Adm Lisa Franchetti, the navy’s first female chief of operations; Adm Linda Fagan, the Coast Guard’s first female commandant; and Gen Charles “CQ” Brown Jr, who was the first Black chief of staff of the air force and the second Black officer to serve as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.</p> 
<p>Earlier this year, Hegseth also dismissed V Adm Shoshana Chatfield, who represented the US military to Nato’s military committee.</p> 
<p>Hegseth, a former Fox News host and Trump loyalist, has drawn criticism for his past remarks about the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pete-hegseth-background-defense-secretary-confirmation-hearing-e160e10c86385a8beff110d9190fb34e">role of women</a> in the military. On a podcast last November with host Shawn Ryan, he said, “I’m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn’t made us more effective. Hasn’t made us more lethal. Has made fighting more complicated.”</p> 
<p>He went on to acknowledge that while women serve important roles in support operations, he opposes their placement in direct combat units. “Dads push us to take risks. Moms put the training wheels on our bikes. We need moms. But not in the military, especially in combat units,” he said in his book.</p> 
<p>He emphasized his views, writing, “Women in the infantry – women in combat on purpose – is another story,” and argued that “women cannot physically meet the same standards as men”.</p> 
<p>However, his stance appeared to soften under Senate scrutiny. During his January confirmation hearing, Hegseth said he supported female troops as long as military standards are preserved.</p> 
<p>Speaking later on The Megyn Kelly Show, he said, “If we have the right standard and women meet that standard, roger. Let’s go.” When asked about the contrast between his past statements and his current position, he responded that “writing a book is different than being secretary of defense”.</p>
