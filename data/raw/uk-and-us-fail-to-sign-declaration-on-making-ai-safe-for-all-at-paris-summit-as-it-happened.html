 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>… and on that note, it’s a wrap from me, <strong>Jakub Krupa.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Here are the three things to take away from today’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> Live blog:</strong></p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>US vice-president <strong>JD Vance</strong> has repeatedly criticised <strong>the EU’s</strong> overly cautious and prescriptive approach to digital regulation, urging Europe to look at the rise of <strong>AI</strong> with “optimism rather than trepidation” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/europe-live-paris-ai-action-summit-macron-von-der-leyen-jd-vance-tariffs?page=with:block-67ab1d1b8f0807c383877261#block-67ab1d1b8f0807c383877261">10:51</a>). In particular, he took aim at the <strong>EU’s Digital Services Act and the GDPR</strong> (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/europe-live-paris-ai-action-summit-macron-von-der-leyen-jd-vance-tariffs?page=with:block-67ab1da68f086e5614a61328#block-67ab1da68f086e5614a61328">10:53</a>), and aimed the bloc to focus on opportunities instead of safety when planning for the roll out of artificial intelligence (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/europe-live-paris-ai-action-summit-macron-von-der-leyen-jd-vance-tariffs?page=with:block-67ab1b978f086e5614a6131d#block-67ab1b978f086e5614a6131d">10:44</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/europe-live-paris-ai-action-summit-macron-von-der-leyen-jd-vance-tariffs?page=with:block-67ab21718f0807c383877276#block-67ab21718f0807c383877276">11:15</a>). As a sign of these tensions, <strong>the US</strong> and <strong>the UK</strong> declined to sign the final summit declaration (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/europe-live-paris-ai-action-summit-macron-von-der-leyen-jd-vance-tariffs?page=with:block-67ab4f558f0839a6831b0cb4#block-67ab4f558f0839a6831b0cb4">14:30</a>).</p></li>

   <li><p>Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> has warned that if <strong>Donald Trump</strong> withdraws US support for <strong>Ukraine</strong>, <strong>Europe</strong> alone will be unable to fill the gap (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/europe-live-paris-ai-action-summit-macron-von-der-leyen-jd-vance-tariffs?page=with:block-67ab5a578f0839a6831b0d1f#block-67ab5a578f0839a6831b0d1f">15:14</a>).

 <h2 class="block-title">Italian song contest that inspired Eurovision starts tonight</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>And finally, for something lighter…</p> 
  <p> The 75th <strong>Sanremo music festival</strong>, at the famous Teatro Ariston, starts tonight, kicking off a week of music with 29 artists competing for the prestigious win, which usually also means they get the Italian spot on the Eurovision final, this year in Basel, Switzerland, in May.</p> 
  <p>The rules are <em><strong>incredibly</strong></em> complex (<a href="https://www.rai.it/dl/doc/2025/01/29/1738170039212_Regolamento%20Sanremo%202025%20con%20modifica%20del%2029%20gennaio%202025.pdf">they run into 40 pages!</a>) but here’s the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TL%3BDR">tl;dr</a>:</p> 
  <p>On the first night, competitors will perform their entries – which must be kept secret until then – and be judged by the jury composed of the representatives of the press room, TV viewers, and audiences online. Later during the week, others get a say, too, with televotes and online votes all combined into the final score.</p> 
  <p>On the final fifth night, votes from all days will be added up, and the final five will be determined and invited to perform again, with the final decision made in equal parts by (1) televoting, (2) press room, TV and web jury, and (3) radio jury.</p> 
  <p><em>Got it? You may need a calculator for all of this.</em></p> 
  <p>Either way, every day the concerts <strong>run well into the night</strong> as they finish past 1am... but as the festival’s host, Carlo Conti, <a href="https://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli/dossier/festival-di-sanremo/2025/02/10/news/carlo_conti_antifascista_sanremo-423994210/?ref=nl-rep-a-bgr">says</a>: <strong>“Have fun. If you don’t have fun at Sanremo, then where?”</strong></p> 
  <p>The competition will be <strong><a href="https://x.com/RaiPlay/status/1888967852834660744">streamed globally by Italian TV Rai</a>.</strong></p> 
  <p>Here is last year’s winner, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKzWskcTTA8">Angelina Mango, with la noia</a>.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Spain to give legal status to migrants affected by deadly Valencia floods</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Spain’s</strong> leftist government said it will give <strong>one-year residence and work permits</strong> to <strong>undocumented migrants</strong> affected by last year’s <strong>devastating floods</strong> that killed over 200 people, AFP reports.</p> 
  <p>The measure approved by the cabinet is part of the government’s recovery response to the October 2024 disaster, which laid waste to swathes of the eastern <strong>Valencia region</strong>, an industrial and agricultural powerhouse.</p> 
  <p>The government expects the measures will benefit <strong>at least 25,000 people.</strong></p> 
  <p>The one-year permits will be granted due to the “exceptional circumstances” faced by illegal migrants during Spain’s worst floods in decades, the migration ministry said in a statement. Once they expire, they can be renewed through regular channels.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">JD Vance makes waves during first trip to Europe, but attention now moves to Ukraine</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Sporting a T-shirt with the logo of “StartupCincy” movement helping tech start-ups in Cincinnati, US vice-president <strong>JD Vance</strong> looked relaxed before his first trip to Europe since inauguration.</p> 
  <p><strong>Making a European debut</strong> in his new role, he naturally attracts a lot of attention as the world scrambles to make friends in the new US administration – and not just on AI, but (perhaps even more so) on defence and trade.</p> 
  <p>His first comments in Paris suggest he will not be afraid to speak his mind about what he sees as deficiencies of or problems with EU policies (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/europe-live-paris-ai-action-summit-macron-von-der-leyen-jd-vance-tariffs?page=with:block-67ab1d1b8f0807c383877261#block-67ab1d1b8f0807c383877261">10:51</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/europe-live-paris-ai-action-summit-macron-von-der-leyen-jd-vance-tariffs?page=with:block-67ab1da68f086e5614a61328#block-67ab1da68f086e5614a61328">10:53</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/europe-live-paris-ai-action-summit-macron-von-der-leyen-jd-vance-tariffs?page=with:block-67ab299c8f08c29ed39442c0#block-67ab299c8f08c29ed39442c0">11:46</a>).</p> 
  <p>But before making his trip, Vance told <strong>Breitbart</strong> that actually <strong>Ukraine</strong> was the main reason for his visit to Paris as he wanted to “have some private conversations with the world leaders who are also going to be there.”</p> 
  <p>“I think there’s a lot that some of the leaders who are present at the AI summit could do to, frankly – <strong>bring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a close, help us diplomatically there</strong> – and so we’re going to be focused on those meetings in France,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Pushing for an end to the nearly three-year war with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a>, Trump discussed the conflict in an interview with broadcaster Fox News that aired on Monday.</p> 
  <p>“They may make a deal, they may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,” he said.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>And so the focus now shifts on to Munich, where Vance will take part in the <strong>Munich Security Conference </strong>with <strong>Ukraine</strong> and the future of <strong>Nato</strong> expected to dominate the agenda, and he will meet Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The meeting could be <strong>Zelenskyy’s most consequential diplomatic trip</strong> since Russia’s full-scale invasion three years ago.</p> 
  <p>The Ukrainian leader warned today in an interview with the Guardian that if Donald Trump withdraws US support for Ukraine, Europe alone will be unable to fill the gap.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">UK refusal to sign AI summit declaration to do with weak language on security, government source says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A UK government source said the Paris AI summit declaration <strong>wasn’t strong enough on security</strong> and did not reflect the UK’s approach as a country. They rejected the suggestion that Britain was trying to curry favour with the US.</p> 
  <p>But a Labour MP said: “I think <strong>we have little strategic room but to be downstream of the US.</strong>” They added that <strong>US AI firms could stop engaging with UK regulators if Britain was perceived to be taking an overly restrictive approach</strong> to the development of the technology.</p> 
  <p>Campaign groups criticised the UK’s decision and said it risked damaging its reputation in this area. Andrew Dudfield, the head of AI at Full Fact, said the UK risked “undercutting its hard-won credibility as a world leader for safe, ethical and trustworthy AI innovation” and that there needed to be “bolder government action to protect people from corrosive AI-generated misinformation”.</p>

  <p>An <strong>Italy-based human rights activist</strong> whose work supports the international criminal court in providing evidence about cases of abuse suffered by migrants and refugees held in Libyan detention camps and prisons <strong>has revealed that Apple informed him his phone was targeted in a spyware attack.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>David Yambio,</strong> the president and co-founder of <strong><a href="https://www.refugeesinlibya.org/">Refugees in Libya</a>,</strong> has been a critic of the Italian government’s migrant pact with the north African country and its recent controversial decision to release <strong>Osama Najim</strong>, a Libyan police chief wanted by the international criminal court (ICC) for suspected war crimes, including torture, murder, enslavement and rape.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The former Spanish football federation boss <strong>Luis Rubiales</strong> has told a court that he asked the player <strong>Jenni Hermoso</strong> if he could kiss her before doing so after the Women’s World Cup victory in 2023.</p> 
  <p>“I am absolutely sure that she gave me her permission,” Rubiales, 47, told the court in Madrid. “In that moment it was something completely spontaneous.”</p> 
  <p>Rubiales is accused of sexual assault and then attempting to coerce Hermoso, with the help of three other former football federation officials, into publicly saying the kiss on the lips at the awards ceremony in Australia had been consensual.</p> 
  <p>He has denied the charges, saying the kiss was consensual, while Hermoso has said it was not.</p> 
  <p>The ensuing scandal eclipsed Spain’s first Women’s World Cup victory and spurred efforts by Spain’s female players to expose sexism and achieve parity with male counterparts.</p>

  <p>“You don’t think something like this could happen,” local politician Inger Hogstrom-Westerling told news agency TT. “It happens in the US and other countries, but you never thought it could happen in Sweden and Örebro,” she said.</p> 
  <p>Police say they still do not know why <strong>Rickard Andersson</strong>, a 35-year-old unemployed loner, embarked on his killing spree and have found nothing to suggest any ideological motive. He appears to have had scanty social contacts, no social media presence, and no links to gang crime.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Nordic correspondent</em></p> 
  <p>The global seafood company <strong>Mowi</strong> is offering a bounty to fishers who catch escaped salmon after <strong>an estimated 27,000 fish went missing</strong> from a farm off the <strong>Norwegian</strong> coast in what campaigners said was a “disaster for wild salmon”.</p> 
  <p>The world’s largest farmed salmon producer is offering a reward of 500 kroner (£36)<strong> </strong>per salmon caught after it said a quarter of its 105,000 salmon population escaped from a cage in Troms, north-west <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/norway">Norway</a>.</p> 
  <p>In Norway, which exports 1.2m tonnes of farmed salmon a year, the problem is such that last summer wild salmon numbers dropped to a historic low, resulting in the closure of 33 rivers to salmon fishing. This summer 42 rivers and three fjords have been proposed for closure.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Strongest tremor yet hits Greek Santorini as it faces prolonged uncertainty</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in Athens</em></p> 
  <p>Over in <strong>Greece</strong> it has been a difficult night for residents in <strong>Santorini</strong> where over the last 12 hours a barrage of tremors, one measuring 5.3 on the <strong>Richter</strong> scale, the strongest yet, have rattled the island and surrounding islets in the southern <strong>Aegean</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Scientists on Monday had expressed optimism – cautious but optimism nonetheless – that the unprecedented seismic crisis was showing signs of abate. Today most were saying it was premature to say the geological phenomenon was nearing an endpoint, or that the near 13,000 earth tremors registered thus far did not mean a much more powerful quake could be ruled out.</p> 
  <p>Some natural disaster experts have begun to fear that a rosier picture is being painted to avert a tourism crisis on Santorini, which as Europe’s top island destination drew 3.5 million visitors last year.</p> 
  <p>In an online post before he announced he would be resigning from the National Committee for Seismic Risk Assessment, the seismologist <strong>Akis Tselepis</strong> wrote: “Unfortunately with the recent seismic activity in Santorini we are, instead of speaking truths, spitting silence. It may be that this narrative spouted by politicians about supposed seismic recession ... is convenient for tourist interests but much more important than any profit is human life.”</p> 
  <p>The seismic swarm had, he warned, built up enough energy to provoke a 6 magnitude earthquake – multiple times more powerful than a 5.3 quake.</p> 
  <p>Greece’s chief disaster expert <strong>Efthymios Lekkas</strong> told state-run broadcaster ERT: “The main earthquake must be half a degree above the mass of earthquakes that have occurred so far in order to stand out – that is, 5.5-5.6.”</p> 
  <p>At least ten tremors registering over 4 on the Richter scale shook the island this morning.</p> 
  <p>“We’re beginning from the start, all over again, and we say that because we don’t know if the 5.3 Richter quake [last night] was the main quake and if so the climax of the [seismic] process,” another prominent seismologist <strong>Gerasimos Papadopoulos</strong> told the Newsit news portal. “We’re once again at another crucial crossroads because we had thought the 5.2 Richter quake on 5 February may have been the principal quake.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Berlin correspondent</em></p> 
  <p>The co-leader of the far-right <strong>Alternative für Deutschland</strong> (AfD), <strong>Tino Chrupalla,</strong> said his party was <strong>best-placed to negotiate on Germany’s behalf</strong> in the battle over steel and aluminium tariffs due to its friendly ties <strong>with the Trump administration.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking to foreign journalists in Berlin on Monday before Trump’s bombshell announcement, Chrupalla noted that he had attended Trump’s inauguration on his team’s invitation and had an open communication channel with the White House.</p> 
  <p>“Germany can circumvent these tariffs with diplomacy, on the basis of negotiations,” he asserted, outlining a strategy that would apparently bypass the European Union.</p> 
  <p>“That’s why you need good political relations (with Washington)... If you have good contacts, meeting each other as equals, you’ll be able to reduce or eliminate these tariffs.” </p> 
  <p>The AfD is polling second on about 20% ahead of the 23 February election but the mainstream parties have ruled out forming a governing coalition with the far right. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">JD Vance's speech at AI Action Summit in Paris - snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Global technology editor</em></p> 
  <p>This was very much the <strong>America First</strong> vision for AI. <strong>JD Vance’s</strong> speech at the Paris AI summit made clear that the Trump administration has <strong>no truck with the European approach to artificial intelligence and tech in general – or China’s.</strong></p> 
  <p>In a wide-ranging and punchy address, the US vice-president started by <strong>throwing shade at the original summit held in the UK</strong> in 2023. That was badged the AI safety summit and Vance indicated that it was too cautious, referring to gatherings about cutting edge technology that can be “too self-conscious, too risk averse.”</p> 
  <p>Speaking in front of the head of the EU’s executive arm, Ursula von der Leyen, <strong>regulation was repeatedly criticised by Vance.</strong> The EU is leading the way in AI regulation with its AI act – and Vance made clear his discomfort with any legislation that could be construed as excessive. The EU’s digital services act - which covers social media - and the privacy-focused GDPR code also received passing criticism.</p> 
  <p>“We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry.”</p> 
  <p>He then added: “We need international regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology rather than strangle it, and we need our European friends in particular to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation.”</p> 
  <p>Speaking in front of the Chinese vice premier <strong>Zhang Guoqing</strong> there was <strong>a clear warning to other nations about co-operating with China.</strong> Warning that partnering with authoritarian regimes “never pays off”, he said: “Some of us in this room have learned from experience partnering with [authoritarian regimes] means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true, just remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley, if you aren’t paying for the product, you are the product.”</p> 
  <p>It was reported overnight that Vance left a leaders’ dinner in Paris on Monday as Guoqing praised trade and the UN. If he went out on his own last night, Vance certainly went out on his own this morning.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Europe could be 'one of the leading AI continents,' EU von der Leyen says, as she ignores Vance's comments</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>European Commission <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> is up next on stage and the contrast between the two dynamic and the tone of the two speeches could not be bigger.</p> 
  <p>She says this is “the third summit on AI safety in just one year,” and yet “three new generations of ever more powerful AI models have been released in that time.”</p> 
  <p>She says she wants Europe to <strong>“be one of the leading AI continents,”</strong> and dismisses suggestions – including by Macron himself! – that “Europe is late to the race, while the US and China have already got ahead.”</p> 
  <p>“The AI race is far from over. Truth is, we are only at the beginning. The frontier is constantly moving, and global leadership is still up for grabs,” she says.</p> 
  <p>She says Europe wants its own “distinctive approach to AI,” focused on collaborative, open-source solutions.</p> 
  <p>She says the bloc “wants to replicate the success story of the CERN laboratory in Geneva,” with AI Gigafactories used to help and train very large models.</p> 
  <p>“We provide the infrastructure for large computational power. Researchers, entrepreneurs and investors will be able to join forces,” she says.</p> 
  <p>She ends by pledging additional €50bn for AI investment in the EU, bringing the total to €200bn.</p> 
  <p>Very notably, she does not respond to many of Vance’s criticisms of the EU and sticks to her speech.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Focus matters,' Vance says, as he calls for focus on opportunities, not risks</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Vance closes his speech with a reference to French military officer Marquis de Lafayette, who served during the American War of Independence.</p> 
  <p>He says he was given a chance to hold his sword during his tour of Paris last night, and it made him think about France, the US, and “the beautiful civilisation that we have build together.”</p> 
  <p>He says that sabres “are dangerous in the wrong hands, but are incredible tools for liberty and prosperity in right hands.”</p> 
  <p>He adds that “if we choose the wrong approach on other things that could be conceived of as dangerous, things like AI, and choose to hold ourselves back, it will alter not only our GDP or the stock market, but the very future of the project that Lafayette and the American founders set off to create.”</p> 
  <p>“This does not mean that all concerns about safety go out the window, but focus matters, and we must focus now on the opportunity to catch lightning in a bottle,” he says.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>With great confidence, I can say it is an opportunity that the Trump administration will not squander, and we hope everyone convened here today feels exactly the same.</em></p>

  <p>He says the Trump administration “will block such efforts full stop,” and safeguard US technologies from “theft and misuse.”</p> 
  <p>In a passage likely to be read in the context of <strong>China</strong>, he says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>I would also remind our international friends here today that partnering with such regimes, it never pays off in the long term, from CCTV to 5G equipment, we’re all familiar with cheap tech in the marketplace that’s been heavily subsidised and exported by authoritarian regimes.</em></p> 
   <p><em>But as I know, and I think some of us in this room have learned from experience, partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Vance</strong> briefly focuses on energy, saying “AI cannot take off unless the world builds the energy infrastructure to support it.”</p> 
  <p>But he then returns to the theme of regulation:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We face the extraordinary prospect of a new Industrial Revolution, one on par with the invention of the steam engine or Bessemer steel, but it will never come to pass if over regulation deters innovators from taking the risks necessary to advance the ball. Nor will it occur if we allow AI to become dominated by massive players looking to use the tech to censor or control users thoughts. …</em></p> 
   <p><em>Who is most aggressively demanding that we, meaning political leaders gathered here today, do the most aggressive regulation? It is very often the people who already have an incumbent advantage in the market.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He turns to examples of what he calls “ahistorical social agendas” replicated through AI in the last few years, and says “the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens right to free speech.”</p>

  <p>Speaking about the prospect of US tariffs, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted">

  <p>But in an highly political speech, as you would expect just weeks before the vote, he also repeatedly took aim at opposition leader Friedrich Merz, accusing him of “U-turns” on a number of issues, including German support for Ukraine, energy and the economy.</p> 
  <p>He also once again used his attack line that Merz’s CDU/CSU proposals on migration were “madness” as they would break the EU’s unity.</p> 
  <p>“If the EU is targeted by American tariffs ... then we are more dependant on European solidarity than any other country. Do you think this solidarity will be there if Germany deliberately breaks European law and closes its borders? Do not be naive,” he says.</p>

  <p>But there is also a clear political question: <strong>how should the EU respond?</strong></p> 
  <p>European Commission president <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> and French president <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> will meet with US vice-president <strong>JD Vance</strong> today, on the sidelines of the AI Action Summit in Paris. It will be their first formal meeting since the inauguration of the new US administration last month.</p> 
  <p>Keeping with the theme, I have asked <strong>various AI models</strong> to take on the role of a European leader and offer suggestions on how to respond to Trump’s increasingly assertive trade policy.</p> 
  <p>It turns out that models do seem to reflect the way policymaking is now being done in respective geographies.</p> 
  <p><strong>French</strong> <strong>Mistral AI’s Le Chat</strong> has offered me a rather bland “European Commission officials on a working trip to Brugge” type of response (also making me think of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4CTLW-Ddu0">“let’s do away with computers”</a> scene from the brilliant British TV series the Thick of It).</p> 
  <p>It told me – <em>and I swear to God, this is verbatim from its answers</em> – to “present a unified front”, “show solidarity with the member states,” and engage in “high-level dialogue,” before considering “targeted retaliatory measures” and filing a complaint to the World Trade Organization. Oh, and to “invest in innovation” to “enhance the competitiveness of European industries.”</p> 
  <p>So good, it could be leaked from an EU official’s inbox, and we would not know.</p> 
  <p>When I asked for unorthodox solutions, it told me to organise a “flashmob” (are they even still a thing in 2025?), record “viral videos,” and buy a billboard in a US city to “raise awareness” about the impact of tariffs. Yeah, good luck with that.</p> 
  <p><strong>American OpenAI’s ChatGPT</strong> struck was notably (way) more <strong>bullish</strong>, directing me to “play the Art of the Deal against Trump” and convince him we can get <strong>“a big, beautiful deal,”</strong> potentially even named after him, and claim it is <strong>“the best in history,”</strong> while <strong>actually getting whatever we want for Europe.</strong></p> 
  <p>“Instead of reacting defensively, we should go on the offensive,” it said, adding that we should also retaliate with expansive tariffs but suspend their application to “leave uncertainty hanging over US businesses” and essentially scare Trump into submission.</p> 
  <p>It then told me to “publicly praise his brilliant negotiating skills <strong>while quietly working around him</strong>,” and “<strong>use exaggerated flattery</strong> to make him think removing tariffs was his idea all along” by forcing him to <strong>“meet his erratic behaviour with controlled unpredictability of our own.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“He may not play by the rules, but that doesn’t mean we can’t beat him at his own game,” it concluded.</p> 
  <p>Someone better send that to Ursula and Emmanuel before they meet with Vance for a Parisian lunch.</p> 
  <p>It’s <strong>Tuesday, 11 February 2025</strong>, and this is <strong>Europe live</strong>. It’s <strong>Jakub Krupa</strong> here.</p> 
  <p>Good morning.</p>
