<p>The Co-op has admitted to more than 100 breaches of a rule that prevents supermarkets blocking rivals from opening competing shops nearby.</p> <p>The UK competition watchdog said the substantial number of breaches by the mutual, which has nearly 2,400 stores, represented “a significant failure of compliance for a business of Co-op’s size”.</p> <p>The Co-op, which markets itself as an ethical business, has rewritten 104 of the rogue agreements, which placed restrictions on land use, and agreed to resolve a further four, according to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).</p> <p>The CMA introduced a rule in 2010 that banned the use of restrictive clauses prohibiting a piece of land or a building from being used for a supermarket to block rivals opening nearby stores, hindering competition.</p> <p>The law was brought in amid concerns about supermarkets <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/may/09/businesscomment.supermarkets">amassing “land banks”</a> of unused property to prevent competitors building stores near their outlets.</p> <p>It was also once commonplace in the grocery industry to place restrictions on the activity of those taking on a lease or buying the land to control competition.</p> <p>Some also employed lengthy exclusivity agreements to prevent, for example, a convenience store from opening in the same block. Such actions were outlawed under the 2010 rules.</p> <p>Daniel Turnbull, the senior director of markets at the CMA, said: “Restrictive agreements by our leading retailers affect competition between supermarkets and impact shoppers trying to get the best deals. We know that Co-op has made a considerable effort to amend all their unlawful agreements, given this order has been in place since 2010. Co-op and the other designated retailers must make sure they do the right thing by their customers in the future.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Co-op, which is understood to be reviewing how the breaches occurred, said: “As a business that is committed to operating fairly, we recognise this is extremely disappointing.</p> <p>“Co-op operates in a range of markets, both as a community retailer and a national funeral provider and the number of breaches amount to less than 2% of transactions across our entire property portfolio.</p> <p>“This is a matter we take very seriously, and we have taken all necessary action to ensure this issue is resolved and does not happen again.”</p> <p>The CMA said the action against the Co-op was part of a wider effort to enforce the 2010 rule.</p> <p>The Co-op, which has a large estate of small outlets, was found to have the longest list of sites with incorrect restrictions in a series of breaches found by the watchdog.</p> <p>The CMA has previously taken action on similar breaches of the same rules beginning with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-demands-action-after-tesco-blocks-rival-supermarkets">Tesco</a> in 2020 (23 breaches), after an<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/10/tesco-failing-comply-2010-competition-order-supermarket-restrictive-convenant"> investigation by the Guardian</a>. The CMA has also taken action against <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/anti-competitive-land-deals-re-written-to-help-businesses-and-shoppers">Waitrose</a> in 2022 (7 breaches); <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-letter-to-sainsburys-about-land-agreements-restricting-competition">Sainsbury’s</a> (18); <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-letter-to-asda-about-land-agreements-restricting-competition">Asda</a> (14) in 2023; <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-letter-to-morrisons-about-land-agreements-restricting-competition">Morrisons</a> (55); and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-letter-to-ms-about-land-agreements-restricting-competition">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> (10) in 2023.</p>
