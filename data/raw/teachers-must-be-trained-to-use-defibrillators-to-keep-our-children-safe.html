<p>Children across England are preparing to return to school this week following the summer break, but parents should be concerned for their safety and wellbeing while they are in school.</p> <p>After years of campaigning after the tragic death of my son Oliver to sudden cardiac arrest, I strongly welcomed the commitment given by the previous government to ensure that all state-funded schools across England received life-saving defibrillators. The rollout of the programme was significant and marked a giant step forward in improving emergency medical readiness, and potentially saving lives in schools across England.</p> <p>Now I am urging the current Labour government to go a step further by ensuring that all school staff receive appropriate and up-to-date training on how to use defibrillators confidently and effectively. Through our work at the <a href="https://www.theoliverkingfoundation.co.uk/">Oliver King Foundation</a>, we have heard first-hand from headteachers and teaching staff across the country that this life-saving equipment is not being used and instead being stored in cupboards because the training on how to use it has not been provided.</p> <p>The presence of defibrillators in schools alone is not going to solve the problem. Providing adequate training is crucial as a means of maximising the valuable investment made by the former government and in ensuring that every child, teacher and visitor in our schools is as safe as possible in the event of a cardiac emergency. Failure to provide this training is putting lives needlessly at risk.</p> <p>Cardiac conditions such as sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (Sads)<a href="https://www.c-r-y.org.uk/a-condition-which-kills-young-people-in-their-prime/"> kill 12 young people under the age of 35 every single week</a> in the UK. The need to ensure our schools are prepared to deal with unexpected emergencies such as cardiac arrest could not be clearer. </p> <p>This is not a partisan issue, but a matter of safeguarding the health and lives of our children. Regardless of political affiliation, we can all agree that schools should be safe spaces where teachers are equipped to respond effectively in emergencies. Training is a commonsense solution that transcends political lines and reflects a shared commitment to the wellbeing of every child in England. As the new school year approaches, I am urging the government to act quickly. <br><strong>Mark King</strong><br><em>The Oliver King Foundation</em></p>
