<p>Surveys show that the increasing number of extreme climate events, including floods, wildfires and hurricanes, has not raised <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/do-extreme-weather-events-increase-public-concern-knowledge-and-attention-to-climate-change-in-china/7169713B5848AE18BEB8892BC6C4A4BC">awareness of the threats</a> posed by climate change. Instead, people change their idea of what they see as normal. This so-called <a href="https://aftercoal.pl/en/the-frog-boiling-syndrome-are-we-getting-accustomed-to-climate-change/">“boiling frog effect</a>” makes gradual change difficult to spot.</p> <p>Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania wondered if climate change could be made more obvious by presenting it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02183-9">in binary terms</a>. Local newspaper archives describing ice skating on Lake Carnegie when it froze in winter inspired a simple experiment.</p> <p>Some test subjects were shown temperature graphs of a fictional town’s winter conditions; others had a chart showing whether or not a fictional lake froze each year. The result, published in Nature, <a href="https://grist.org/science/break-through-climate-apathy-data-visualization-lake-freezing-study/">showed those who</a> receiving the second graphic consistently saw climate change as more real and imminent.</p> <p>Binary data gives a clearer impression of the “before” and “after”. The disappearing ice is more vivid and dramatic than a temperature trace, even though the underlying data is the same.</p> <p>“We are literally showing them the same trend, just in different formats,” says Rachit Dubey, a co-author of the study.</p> <p>These results should help drive more effective ways of communicating the impact of climate change in future by finding simple binary, black-and-white examples of its effects.</p>
