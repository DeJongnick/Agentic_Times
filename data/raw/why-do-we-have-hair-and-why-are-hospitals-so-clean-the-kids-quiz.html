    <h2 class="quiz__correct-answers-title">Solutions</h2>
    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:A - It’s theorised that we grow hair on our heads and on our bodies because we evolved from primates – a group of mammals that includes monkeys and apes. Our hair protects us from the heat of the sun during the day and at night-time it keeps us warm., 2:C - Seashells are the outside of a mollusc, which is a small sea creature such as a snail or clam. The mollusc that used that shell was probably eaten by a hungry bigger sea creature!, 3:C - Evidence has been found to suggest Pliny the Younger, a Roman lawyer and author, was telling his students to practise their public speaking outside of class back when he was alive, between 61 and 113 AD. So homework has been around for a very long time!, 4:D - Electricity is the flow of tiny particles called electrons. A power source, such as a battery, gives these electrons the energy to flow., 5:B - Hospitals must be kept clean because there are so many people in there who are sick already! If the hospital was dirty, then bacteria and viruses might spread and make those people get sicker.</p>
