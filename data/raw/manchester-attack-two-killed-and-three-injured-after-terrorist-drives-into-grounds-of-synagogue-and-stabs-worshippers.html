<p>Police have shot dead a terrorist who killed two people and seriously injured three others in an attack at a synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.</p> 
<p>Using a car to ram into the grounds of the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall, the man then stabbed worshippers in a six-minute rampage that ended only when armed officers shot at him twice, fearing he also had an explosive device tied to his chest. It was later found to be a fake.</p> 
<p>Police named the attacker on Thursday night as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent. Greater Manchester police revealed that three other people – two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s – had been arrested “on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism”.</p> 
<p>It is understood the attacker entered the UK as a young child and was granted British citizenship in 2006.</p>

<p>The attack drew widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, with Keir Starmer calling the knife attacker a “vile individual” who “attacked Jews because they are Jews, and attacked Britain because of our values”. Political rivals Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage were among those joining the prime minister in showing support for the Jewish community.</p> 
<p>It happened days before the second anniversary of the 7 October attacks by Hamas in Israel. Police said there would be heightened security at synagogues and Jewish community centres in coming days. Research published on Thursday showed that more than a third (35%) of British Jews said they felt unsafe in the UK, compared with 9% before the 7 October attacks.</p> 
<p>The Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council ​said in a statement on Thursday evening that the attack was “sadly something we feared was coming”.</p> 
<p>They added: “We call on all those in positions of power and influence to take the required action to combat hatred against Jewish people, and will be working with the authorities on a series of additional measures to protect our community over the coming days.”</p>

<p>Starmer flew back to the UK early from a gathering of European leaders in Denmark to chair an emergency <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/cobr-cobra">Cobra meeting</a> after the incident before speaking to the nation from Downing Street..</p> 
<p>Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement: “Israel grieves with the Jewish community in the UK after the barbaric terror attack in Manchester. Our hearts are with the families of the murdered, and we pray for the swift recovery of the wounded.”</p> 
<p>In reference to his combative speech at the UN general assembly last week, the Israeli prime minister added: “As I warned at the UN, weakness in the face of terrorism only brings more terrorism. Only strength and unity can defeat it.”</p> 
<p>Police said three people remained in hospital with serious injuries. One was stabbed while another was hit by a car, and a third man “presented himself at hospital with an injury that may have been sustained as officers stopped the attacker”.</p> 
<p>The Guardian understands the attacker’s last known address was in Manchester. Police said officers were continuing inquiries as part of their investigation in Crumpsall and nearby Prestwich.</p>

<p>In a statement, Greater Manchester police said: “We are now able to confirm that, although formal identification is yet to take place, we believe the person responsible for Thursday’s attacks is 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie. He is a British citizen of Syrian descent.</p> 
<p>“A suspicious device worn by the attacker during the incident has been assessed and was deemed not to be viable.</p> 
<p>“Based on what we currently know, our records do not show any previous Prevent referrals relating to this individual.” The statement added: “We are working to understand the motivation behind the attack as the investigation continues.”</p> 
<p>The investigation is being led by counter-terrorism police.</p>

<p>At an earlier press conference, the GMP chief constable, Sir Stephen Watson, said that, thanks to the bravery of worshippers, security staff and the fast response of the police, the attacker was prevented from entering the synagogue.</p> 
<p>He said: “There were a large number of worshippers attending the synagogue at the time of this attack.”</p> 
<p>Witnesses were said to have seen a car driving erratically before a man got out and started attacking people with a knife. When it became clear what was happening, members of the congregation are said to have blockaded the doors to the synagogue.</p> 
<p>Rob Kanter, 45, a university lecturer with a PhD in Jewish-Muslim relations, was inside the synagogue at the time of the attack. When he first heard the shots, Kanter said he felt “bewildered, because I think the adrenaline kicks in” and then found himself thinking “am I really hearing this?”</p> 
<p>His first response was “how are we going to keep ourselves and everyone else safe?” But he said the mood inside the synagogue was “actually relatively calm” as the attack unfolded outside.</p> 
<p>Kanter said: “I would say the mood among our fellow congregants was very calm, and everyone deals with these things in their own way. Some people get through this in a very quiet way, others like to talk, some people even try to use an element of humour just to keep themselves going.”</p> 
<p>Kanter said that once they were evacuated by police, the rabbi did his best to continue with the Yom Kippur service.</p> 
<p>GMP said officers had been called to the synagogue on Middleton Road at 9.31am by a person who said he had witnessed a car being driven towards members of the public and that one man had been stabbed.</p> 
<p>The force said: “Firearms officers were deployed at 9.34am as police continued to receive further reports from members of the public that a security guard had been attacked with a knife.”</p> 
<p>It said it declared Plato – the national codeword used by police and emergency services when responding to a “marauding terror attack” – and a major incident at 9.37am.</p> 
<p>Shots were fired by police firearms officers at 9.38am, with paramedics arriving at 9.41am, the statement continued.</p> 
<p>Video shared on social media appeared to show police officers pointing guns at someone lying on the ground outside the front of the synagogue. Members of the public could be heard shouting to firearms officers that the suspect had a bomb strapped to him.</p>

<p>Distressed relatives and friends of those inside the building gathered at the cordon. A woman whose husband was inside the synagogue said she was sick with worry as she had been unable to contact him since the attack. </p> 
<p>“We’re just waiting for news,” said the woman, who did not wish to be identified. “I’ve not even got dressed yet, I just ran out in my pyjamas.” </p> 
<p>Another woman, who lives nearby, said she had family and friends who attended the synagogue and she had rushed out as soon as she heard the police helicopter.</p> 
<p>Olivia Gold said: “I’m absolutely distraught. It’s Jewish new year as well and this is the holiest day in the calendar … It would have been very busy, mainly with the men doing the service. It’s a big shul [synagogue].”</p> 
<p>The UK’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, said on Thursday night: “This is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come.”</p> 
<p>He added: “This is not only an assault on the Jewish community, but an attack on the very foundations of humanity and the values of compassion, dignity and respect which we all share.”</p>
