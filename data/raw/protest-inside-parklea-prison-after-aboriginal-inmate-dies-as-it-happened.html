This included personal photos, social media account details and the number of tattoos a person had.</p> <p>If passed, a standard rental application form will be introduced to clarify what information can and cannot be collected, and altered photographs would have to be disclosed. This includes using artificially generated furniture that shows a double bed in a bedroom that is only large enough to fit a single one, or digitally modifying photos to obscure property damage.</p> <p>The legislation introduces penalties of up to $11,000 for individuals and $49,500 for corporations for agents and landlords who fail to adhere to the privacy rules, or $5,500 for individuals and $22,000 for businesses for non-disclosure of misleading or altered photographs.</p> <p>The minister for better regulation and fair trading, <strong>Anoulack Chanthivong</strong>, said: “Renters are entitled to dignity and privacy when living in a rental property – and this extends to their personal information too.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-29T00:47:35.636Z">at 1.47am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-686086968f080e774971330e" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/caitlin-cassidy"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-29T00:20:22.486Z">1.20am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Cyberbullying and sexually-explicit deepfakes top concerns in school bullying review</strong></p> <p>Back to the state education ministers’ meeting, bullying was also on the agenda as a review into the problem attracted more than 1,300 submissions.</p> <p>Ministers were briefed by co-chairs of the review, <strong>Dr Charlotte Keating</strong> and<strong> Dr Jo Robinson </strong>AM, and agreed that the use of electronic devices, including creating sexually-explicit deepfakes, would be addressed in the review.
