<p>Gianluigi Donnarumma has welcomed having to compete with James Trafford to be Manchester City’s No 1, the Italian goalkeeper saying “together we can make success”.</p> <p>The 26-year-old was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/02/manchester-city-sign-gianluigid-donnarumma-as-proud-ederson-joins-fenerbahce">signed from Paris Saint-Germain</a> for about £30m (€35m) on transfer deadline day, the move causing some surprise after Trafford joined from Burnley on the last day of July for £27m.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/10/omar-marmoush-likely-to-miss-manchester-derby-and-at-risk-of-long-injury-absence">Omar Marmoush likely to miss Manchester derby and at risk of long injury absence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trafford displaced Ederson, who left for Fenerbahce for £14m last week, as Pep Guardiola’s first choice but made a shaky start, being culpable for João Palhinha’s goal in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Tottenham’s 2-0 win</a> at City in their second league game.</p> <p>On competing for the goalkeeper jersey, Donnarumma said: “I’m happy because competition is good for everyone. I can’t wait to meet [James], and I can’t wait to meet my new teammates. We have to be a strong and united group with people who care for each other and that is the key to success. Together we can make great success.</p> <p>“I want to enjoy everything, I want to get to know the city and get to know new people and my new teammates. I’m really looking forward to discovering the environment of the stadium and I can’t wait to take to the pitch and hear the sounds of the stadium and hear the support.”</p> <p>The Italian trained for the first time with Guardiola’s squad on Thursday. The manager has yet to decide whether to give him his debut in Sunday’s visit of Manchester United for the 167th derby.</p>    <p>Donnarumma said: “Playing in the Premier League with Manchester City is a great emotion for me and I’m ready for this challenge. I’ve always dreamed about playing in the Premier League, as it’s the best league in the world.</p> <p>“For a player, I think achieving in the Premier League is the maximum for his career, therefore I’m really happy to be here. I’m willing to take to the pitch for this club who has been trying so much to sign me and I hope I can pay that trust back.”</p> <p>Donnarumma was City’s fifth major acquisition of the window, following the arrivals of Trafford, Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, who is injured, and Rayan Aït-Nouri.</p>
