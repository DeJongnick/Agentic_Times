<p>The former Sheffield Wednesday manager Danny Röhl is now the favourite to succeed Russell Martin at Rangers after Steven Gerrard dramatically withdrew from talks over the Ibrox post.</p> <p>Gerrard, who had returned from the Middle East to meet with Ibrox officials in London, had been the overwhelming choice of the Rangers support. Those directors now face an even bigger challenge to win over a seriously disgruntled fan base. Rangers want a new manager in place before Dundee United visit Ibrox on Saturday.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/07/steven-gerrard-england-golden-generation-egotistical-losers">England’s golden generation were egotistical losers, says Steven Gerrard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Martin’s disastrous, 123-day Rangers stint <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/steven-gerrard-in-frame-rangers-return-russell-martin-sacked">ended after the draw at Falkirk</a> on Sunday. Thoughts immediately turned towards Gerrard, who was in charge at Ibrox between 2018 and 2021. The former Liverpool captain has been out of work since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/30/steven-gerrard-focuses-on-positives-after-leaving-saudi-arabia-al-ettifaq">leaving Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia late January</a> but has remained based in Bahrain.</p>    <p>Gerrard’s interest in the Rangers position was sufficient for him to travel to meet with a club delegation. Gerrard has now made it known he feels the time is not right to return to Ibrox.</p> <p>While the scenario has been portrayed as mutually friendly – and Rangers have not offered anyone the job – this constitutes another public relations blow the Ibrox hierarchy could well do without given the swell of support behind the ex-England captain.</p> <p>Röhl, who also met Rangers’ American ownership at the end of last week, was under serious consideration before Martin was hired in June. The 36-year-old’s spell at Wednesday was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/30/sheffield-wednesday-facing-efl-action-and-possible-walkout-after-failing-to-pay-players">overshadowed by off-field problems</a>. His lack of working involvement in Scottish football, though, is an issue Rangers observers will be keen to highlight.</p> <p>Röhl left Hillsborough in late July. He previously worked as a coach at RB Leipzig, Bayern Munich, Southampton and the German national team. Sean Dyche, who had earlier been linked with Rangers, had also made it clear he was not keen on the job.</p>
