<h2>Into a Finnish labyrinth</h2> 
<p>One of the most magical places I’ve been is Lake Saimaa in eastern Finland – a huge labyrinth of islands and tranquil forests where you don’t come across many people. We rented a lakeside cabin (typically they cost from about €100 a night, sleeping two) and watched the midnight sun shimmer across peaceful waters. Days were spent kayaking between uninhabited islets or hiking pine-scented trails, with only the call of black-throated divers (or loons) for company. We visited the <a href="https://www.visitfinland.com/en/product/4cd716a9-d777-4e44-81da-170c72034fff/linnansaari-national-park/">Linnansaari national park</a> on an archipelago in the middle of the vast lake (the largest in Finland and fourth largest freshwater lake in Europe), where encounters with rare Saimaa ringed seals await. It’s nature’s embrace at its purest – remote, quiet and utterly rejuvenating.<br><strong>Anthony</strong></p> 
<h2>Canyons and forests in Montenegro</h2> 
<p>Last autumn, I visited <a href="https://nparkovi.me/parks/Durmitor">Durmitor national park</a> in northern Montenegro, a quiet and beautiful place in the Dinaric Alps. The road there passed through thick pine forests and opened on to wide valleys surrounded by tall, rocky mountains. I walked to the Black Lake (Crno Jezero), where the water was so still it perfectly reflected the autumn colours of the trees. In the hills, shepherds looked after their sheep, and small villages sold fresh cheese and honey. I also gazed down into Tara River Canyon, which is among Europe’s deepest gorges; right at the bottom, several thousand feet below me, I could see the bright turquoise ribbon of the river. <br><strong>Lorna Walkden</strong></p>

<h2>Cycling through the Bosnian countryside</h2> 
<p>My partner and I cycled the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/apr/25/cyro-trail-new-cycle-track-dubrovnik-mostar-bosnia">Ćiro trail</a> in Bosnia Herzegovina. We picked up <a href="https://ciro-trail.com/en/">the trail</a> in Ivanica and followed it for more than 80 miles to Mostar. It follows the route of the Dubrovnik to Mostar railway line, which closed in the 1970s, and has a lot of spooky, bat-filled tunnels. We barely met another person on the route. One night we camped overnight in a pub beer garden because we were worried about mines. Stunning scenery, spooky history, and we saw tortoises on the trail.<br><strong>Anna Fenton</strong></p> 
<h2>Pyrenean hideaway, Spain</h2> 
<p>If there was ever a jaw-dropping way to enter Spain it has to be over the peaks of the Pyrenees to the village of Ochagavía in Navarre. Nestled in the valley of Salazar, its cobbled streets and whitewashed homes are surrounded by rivers, forests and peaks where walkers mingle with birds of prey, chamois, marmots and an occasional hermit. When civilisation and replenishment are needed, <a href="https://www.kixkia.com/">Sidrería Kixkia</a>, a restaurant in Ochagavía, will fill your very grateful tank with local cider and a very meaty menu.<br><strong>Liz Owen Hernandez</strong></p> 
<h2>Remote islands off northern Germany</h2> 
<p>We stayed at the charming seaside resort of Cuxhaven in Germany and took the horse-drawn carriage over mud flats to visit the tidal island <a href="https://www.hamburg-travel.com/discover-hamburg/areas/island-neuwerk/">Neuwerk</a> with its extraordinary 700-year-old lighthouse. I’d also recommend a ferry trip beyond Neuwerk to incredible Heligoland island to see the 47-metre-high Lange Anna sea stack and the large gannet colony. You can see the craters left by the British in 1947 when the occupying authorities decided to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39590752">blow up </a>the remaining German military installations on the island in one giant explosion, having already bombed the island severely in 1945. Yet the tiny island with its red cliffs and grassy plateau survived somehow, and is now home to more than 1,000 people.<br><strong>Sue Kyson</strong></p> 
<h2>Kayaking between icebergs, Iceland</h2> 
<p>Starting in Reykjavík, with my 15-year-old, I took a rental car for a road trip, staying in small hotels and hostels on the way. We went kayaking between icebergs in the Jökulsárlón lagoon, snowmobiling and ice-climbing on the Sólheimajökull glacier and whale-watching near Húsavík. We were amazed to see the molten lava on the Reykjanes peninsula, as well as the interactive volcano museum near Vik. Highlights for my teen included taking a ferry to the island of Grímsey to snorkel with puffins while they were diving for fish.<br><strong>Karen Guenzl</strong></p> 
<h2>Brittany’s quiet side</h2> 
<p>Tucked away in western Morbihan, an hour from Vannes and the Breton coast, Inguiniel is a quiet corner of Brittany, where rolling hills and forests invite you to slow down. We stayed at picture-perfect <a href="https://www.brittanytourism.com/offers/camping-de-pont-calleck-inguiniel-en-1964600/">Camping Pont Calleck</a>, which was ideal as a walking and cycling base. From there we cycled to Le Faouët, a town with a pretty square, a 16th-century market hall, and striking gothic chapels. As evening fell, our ride took us along the River Scorff past weirs and watermills and eventually to a quiet auberge for a traditional Breton meal.<br><strong>Kevin Atkins</strong></p> 
<h2>Winning tip: bathed in constant daylight, Norway’s Svalbard</h2> 
<p>The Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard (which used to be called Spitzbergen) in summer is bathed in constant daylight because it is entirely within the Arctic Circle. <a href="https://huskytravellers.com/">Dog sledding on wheels</a> is a great way to experience this remote landscape, guiding your teams of eager huskies over the tundra, past mountains necklaced with puffy Arctic cottongrass flowers. Boat trips, passing near the town of Barentsburg, the inhabitants of which are mostly Russian, allow closeup views of slumbering walruses, minke whales and dozens of seals. Nearby, huge cliffs at Alkhornet are the breeding ground for thousands of birds, and below the nests, arctic foxes wait patiently for their next meal. Afterwards, <a href="https://svalbad.no/">rent a floating sauna cabin</a>, leaping into the sea to cool off. <br><strong>Caroline</strong></p>
