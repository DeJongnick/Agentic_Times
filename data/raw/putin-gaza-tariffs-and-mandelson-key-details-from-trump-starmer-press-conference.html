<p>Given an hour to speak freely in front of the world’s media, Donald Trump is always likely to spring a surprise or two.</p> 
<p>His joint press conference with Keir Starmer at Chequers on Thursday was largely a disciplined performance, skirting around several potential topics of conflict. But it was still full of news, telling details, and startling information and opinions. <br><br>Here are some of the most important, and some you might have missed.</p>

<h2>Trump blames Putin for the war in Ukraine – today</h2> 
<p>The US president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/trump-ukraine-war-russia-could-have-made-a-deal">switches between</a> blaming Russia and Ukraine for the war between the two countries, but 90 minutes with Starmer appeared to have focused the president’s attention on the role of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.</p> 
<p>“I spoke to President Putin about Ukraine, it was the apple of his eye,” Trump said. “He would have never done what he did, except that he didn’t respect the leadership of the United States.”</p> 
<p>The president does not appear to want to increase sanctions on Russia however, seeking instead to criticise other countries for buying Russian oil.</p> 
<h2>Starmer is worried about provoking Trump on Gaza</h2> 
<p>Downing Street’s worries that the UK’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/17/reports-say-starmer-will-recognise-palestinian-state-over-weekend">impending recognition</a> of Palestinian statehood would cause a divide between the two leaders proved unfounded. Trump admitted the two leaders disagreed over the issue, but added it was “one of our few disagreements”.</p> 
<p>In his efforts to placate the president however, Starmer entirely avoided talking about the bloodshed and starvation that Israel is causing in Gaza. </p> 
<p>“Hamas … don’t want two-state solution,” the prime minister said. “They don’t want peace, they don’t want the ceasefire.” His comments earned a pat on the back from Trump. </p> 
<h2>Starmer will defend the Online Safety Act</h2> 
<p>Allies of Trump <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/trump-ally-calls-for-big-tech-united-front-to-fight-uk-and-eu-online-safety-laws-13405165">have criticised</a> European online safety rules, saying they unfairly target American technology companies. Starmer however believes he has found an argument that will resonate with the president.</p> 
<p>“Free speech is one of the founding values of the United Kingdom … [but] I draw a limit between free speech and the speech of those that want to peddle paedophilia and suicide social media to children,” he said.</p> 
<h2>Trump has noticed Starmer’s defence spending commitments</h2> 
<p>Days before Starmer travelled to Washington DC earlier this year, the prime minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/25/starmer-planning-big-cuts-to-aid-budget-to-boost-defence-spending-say-sources">announced a huge cut</a> in international aid to pay for an increase in defence spending. </p> 
<p>The decision prompted outrage from international aid agencies and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/28/anneliese-dodds-resigns-keir-starmer-cut-aid-budget">the resignation</a> of one of his cabinet ministers. But it does appear to have bought him some favour in the White House.</p> 
<p>“I want to congratulate the United Kingdom on making the vital commitment to spend 5% of GDP on defence at the Nato summit this year,” Trump said.</p> 
<h2>There has been no progress on tariffs</h2> 
<p>“He’s a tough negotiator,” Trump said about Starmer when talking about the trade deal, before turning to the prime minister to add: “I think it was a better deal for you than us, but these are minor details.”</p> 
<p>But there was no mention on Thursday of reducing tariffs on British steel exports, something which the deal promised but now appears to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/16/plan-slash-us-steel-tariffs-shelved-ahead-donald-trump-visit">have been abandoned</a>. Trump’s commitment to tariffs in general remains strong.</p> 
<p>“The United States, as you probably have heard, is doing better than it has ever done in terms of business and investment,” he said. “A lot of it’s because of tariffs.” </p> 
<h2>The US is trying to retake control of Bagram</h2> 
<p>Bagram was the US’s largest military base in Afghanistan until it left the country in 2021. Now Trump appears to want it back thanks to its proximity to China, though his comments suggest he is trying to negotiate over its control rather than contemplating a reinvasion.</p> 
<p>“We’re going to keep Bagram – one of the biggest airbases in the world,” the president said. “We’re trying to get it back, by the way. OK, that could be a little breaking news. We’re trying to get it back, because they need things from us.</p> 
<p>“One of the reasons we want the base is, as you know, it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.”</p> 
<h2>Keir Starmer was christened</h2> 
<p>The prime minister is an atheist who observes some Jewish traditions because of his wife. </p> 
<p>But asked by GB News whether Britain was still a Christian country, he said on Thursday: “I was christened. So that is my church – has been all my life.” </p> 
<h2>Donald Trump appears to have forgotten who Peter Mandelson is</h2> 
<p>In May Peter Mandelson stood over Trump’s left shoulder as the president signed the UK-US trade agreement. He left <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/13/peter-mandelson-maga-labour-lord-charmed-donald-trump-inner-circle">with a souvenir</a> from the president himself. “Peter,” it read. “Great job!”</p> 
<p>Some British officials were worried therefore that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations">Starmer’s decision to sack Mandelson</a> over his friendship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein could cause a rift with the president, not least because Trump had his own well-publicised friendship with Epstein.</p> 
<p>Asked about Mandelson on Thursday however, the president suffered an apparent attack of amnesia. “I don’t know him,” Trump replied, before handing over to the prime minister.</p>
