  <p>A fourth day of strikes between Israel and Iran continues as global leaders meet today at the G7 Summit in Canada.</p> 
  <p>Here are the top headlines we’ve followed today:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel indicated that its attacks on Iran are unfinished, and that it would not rule out targeting the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in interviews with US media today.</strong> Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> told the Associated Press that Israeli strikes have set Iran’s nuclear program back a “very, very long time” and he would “not be surprised” if the attacks toppled the Iranian government. Speaking on ABC News, Netanyahu added that killing Khamenei would not “escalate the conflict” but rather “end it.” On social media, Israel’s foreign minister <strong>Gideon Sa’ar </strong>wrote that he had told the European Union’s foreign minister <strong>Kaja Kallas</strong> that its military operation in Iran was unfinished and that “Israel will act to complete it.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Meanwhile, Iran called its counter-attacks on Israel “self-defense” and has appealed to Gulf State leaders for aid asking Donald Trump to help negotiate a ceasefire with Israel.</strong> Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations told the body’s Security Council that its strikes on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> are “proportionate defensive operations directed exclusively at military objectives and associated infrastructure”, Reuters reports. Iranian officials have also asked the leaders of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to mediate discussions with the United States, Reuters reports.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The United States has relocated refueling aircraft to Europe in order to give Donald Trump military options as hostilities escalate between Iran and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, Reuters reports. </strong>Reuters and the New York Times also report that the USS Nimitz, an aircraft carrrier, is en route to the Middle East as part of a planned deployment. The news comes even as US senator <strong>Tim Kaine</strong> introduced legislation to restrict Donald Trump’s war powers.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Group of Seven leaders drafted a joint statement calling for de-escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict, according to two sources and a draft seen by Reuters. </strong>The draft commits to safeguarding market stability, including energy markets, and says Israel has the right to defend itself. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> does not intend to sign the statement, CBS News reports, citing unnamed US officials.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>European countries have begun evacuating their citizens from Israel.</strong> Germany will evacuate its citizens via Jordan’s capital Amman, with a charter flight scheduled for Wednesday. Meanwhile, the UK is establishing a system for UK nationals to register their presence in Israel.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russia believes Iran is exercising its right to defend itself against attack by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said.</strong> Russian news agencies also quoted Ryabkov as saying that Russia was discussing the crisis with the United States as well as maintaining contacts with both Israel and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>.</p></li>

  <p><strong>House Speaker Mike Johnson will postpone a visit to Israel due to the ongoing hostilities between Israel and Iran.</strong></p> 
  <p>“Due to the complex situation currently unfolding in Iran and Israel, Speaker Ohana and I have made the decision to postpone the special session of the Knesset. We look forward to rescheduling the address in the near future and send our prayers to the people of Israel and the Middle East,” Johnson said.</p>

  <p><strong>Humanitarian organisations told UK parliamentarians they fear colleagues in Gaza will “die in the dark” as the world shifts its attention to concerns of a regionwide war.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking on Monday before the foreign affairs committee on Israel’s war on Gaza, a number of humanitarian organisations including <strong>Médecins Sans Frontières</strong> (MSF), <strong>Medical Aid for Palestinians</strong> (MAP) and <strong>the Norwegian Refugee Council</strong> (NRC) spoke of the humanitarian crisis on the ground in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.</p> 
  <p>Opening the evidence session on Monday, the committee chair and MP <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong> said the “eyes of the world have turned away” from what’s happened in Gaza the last few days.</p> 
  <p>“It’s gone off the news and it’s not like things aren’t happening,” said Thornberry. “It’s important that we put information before the public.”</p> 
  <p>“This has been the darkest and most terrifying period of the attacks so far,” said <strong>Rohan Talbot</strong>, director of advocacy and campaigns at MAP. </p> 
  <p>Talbot spoke of the daily casualties from Israeli bombardment and at aid distribution points, and fears among colleagues when Israel cut internet in the territory a few days ago. </p> 
  <p>“They worry they will die in the dark,” he said.</p> 
  <p>For MSF, understanding the situation on the ground has been difficult because of the communication blackout in northern and central Gaza, said <strong>Anna Halford</strong>, field coordinator for MSF and Doctors without Borders.</p> 
  <p>“The situation in Gaza has not stopped, has not changed, there is still what amounts to a total blockade,” said Halford. </p> 
  <p>For the last 19 months there had been nearly 500 community points for people to obtain food in Gaza, said Halford, most of which were supported by international efforts. Now, she said, there are four.</p> 
  <p>Halford said that the organisation has had 4 aid trucks enter the territory since 27 May. At the border, 100 trucks containing essential drugs, materials and equipment to provide surgery and care for chronic diseases, are awaiting entry. </p> 
  <p>“There is nothing humanitarian about this system,” she said. “We are weeks away from having to make choices about quality of care, because there won’t be any care to provide.”</p> 
  <p>Also speaking before MPs was <strong>Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan</strong>, a pediatric doctor who has travelled into the territory with MAP, most recently as Israel broke the ceasefire in March. </p> 
  <p>“What future have we left for these children?” Haj-Hassan told MPs over video.</p> 
  <p>She recalled the hospital she volunteered in being attacked by a drone as she worked in the emergency room. She recalled mass casualties of children and described a complete dismantling of the territory’s healthcare infrastructure.</p> 
  <p>“I remember thinking to myself this is the worst it could possibly get, something will change, and it hasn’t.”</p>

  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> held informal talks over a glass of wine at the G7 summit with <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong>, the German chancellor, France’s president <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong>, <strong>Mark Carney</strong>, the Canadian prime minister, and <strong>Georgia Meloni</strong>, the Italian prime minister, Downing Street has said.</p> 
  <p><strong>The Middle East crisis “featured heavily” in the talks, a No 10 spokesperson said, although no other details were available given the leaders were talking without any officials present</strong>. Asked if another focus of the talks was “Trump-handling strategy”, the spokesperson said he would not characterise it as that.</p> 
  <p>The gathering happened by chance at the main G7 hotel in Kanakaskis in Alberta, after Starmer had held a formal bilateral with Meloni. The UK prime minister and Merz started talking in a restaurant area, and were joined successively by Macron, Carney and then Meloni. They “had a glass of wine each”, the spokesperson said.<br>While UK officials stressed this was not a snub to <strong>Donald Trump</strong> given the US president did not arrive at the summit until later on Sunday night, such talks will be seen as a way for a key group of G7 leaders to present a united front to the volatile US president. Starmer is due to meet Trump later on Monday.</p>

  <p><strong>The UK government is setting up a formal system for UK nationals in Israel to register that they are there, Keir Starmer has told broadcasters at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Canada.</strong></p> 
  <p>Ahead of a day of talks which will be based around ways to wind back the Iran-Israel clashes, the UK prime minister said he was deeply worried about the possibility of the knock-on effects on the region.</p> 
  <p>“For British nationals in Israel, we’re giving advice today to register their presence, so there will be a portal for that,” he said, following UK travel advice against travelling to Israel. Officials said the portal is expected to be live later on Monday.</p> 
  <p>Asked about his efforts at the G7, Starmer said: “It is really important that we focus on de-escalation, because the risks of the conflict escalating are obvious across the region and beyond the region., the impact that this could and probably will have on Gaza, which is a tinderbox, and, of course, the impact on the economy. That is why the G7 has such a focus on de-escalation. That will be an intense discussion for our talks today</p> 
  <p>“We’re just arriving for the beginning of these talks. We haven’t started the sessions yet, so there’s going to be a whole day of discussions about all manner of things, including the economy, the global economy, and a number of other matters. But this will be a central issue.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">UK declines to say if it backs US negotiating demand</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The UK has declined to say if it supported the US negotiating demand that Iran must lose its right to enrich uranium inside Iran, the issue on which the bilateral Iran-US talks were stalled, but had not yet aborted.</strong></p> 
  <p> A sixth round of talks scheduled for Sunday were cancelled after Israel mounted its pre-emptive military strike.</p> 
  <p>The issue still matters since the possibility of a return to diplomacy rests in part on whether there is still any scope for manoeuvre about a limited Iranian right to enrich, or whether European countries was always backing the Trump administration policy, and will not press for the issue to be reopened.</p> 
  <p>Iran has said it will only consider returning to talks if the Israeli attacks cease, and it is continuing to insist on its right to enrich as a matter of national sovereignty.</p> 
  <p>Britain, France, and Germany last week played a central role in passing a motion censuring Iran for failing to cooperate with the UN nuclear inspectorate the IAEA, but the British government has not yet said in public that it now believes Iran had permanently forfeited the right to enrich.</p> 
  <p>Iran negotiated a right to enrich in the 2015 nuclear deal, a multilateral agreement from which the UK France and Germany have never withdrawn, unlike the US which withdrew in 2018.</p> 
  <p>The Foreign Office in response to a question on whether the UK continued to support Iran’s right to enrich said simply that “the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty does not provide states with a right to enrich uranium; it also does not prohibit uranium enrichment”.</p> 
  <p>Officials added the UK was clear that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon and have long called for Iran to de-escalate its deeply concerning nuclear activities.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Ali Khamenei: ruthless defender of Iran’s revolution with few good options left</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>When he appeared in public for the first time in five years in October, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, had an uncompromising message. Israel “won’t last long”, he told tens of thousands of supporters at a mosque in Tehran in a Friday sermon.</p> 
  <p>“We must stand up against the enemy while strengthening our unwavering faith,” the 84-year-old told the gathering.</p> 
  <p>Days before, Israel had killed Hassan Nasrallah, the veteran secretary general of Hezbollah, with huge bombs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/israel-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah">dropped on the militant Islamist movement’s headquarters in Beirut</a>. The assassination was a personal blow to Khamenei, who had known Nasrallah for decades.</p> 
  <p>The Israeli air offensive against Iran, launched on Friday, is another such blow. It has prompted more defiance from Tehran, and a barrage of missiles and drones launched at Tel Aviv, but neither appear likely to stop the Israeli attacks. Iran’s air defences are apparently ineffective and the coalition of Islamist militias that Khamenei had built up to deter Israel is effectively shattered.</p>

  <p><strong>Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said the latest attack on Israel employed a new method that caused Israel’s multi-layered defence systems to target each other</strong>, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>“The initiatives and capabilities used in this operation, despite the comprehensive support of the United States and Western powers and the possession of the most up-to-date and newest defence technology, led to the successful and maximum hitting of the missiles on the targets in the occupied territories,” it said.</p>
