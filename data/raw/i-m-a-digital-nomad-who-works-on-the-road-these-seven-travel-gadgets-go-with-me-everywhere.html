<p>Two years ago, I traded the routine of a fixed desk for a rotating cast of airport gates, train stations and cafe tables. As a freelance journalist constantly on the move, I’ve learned that the right gear doesn’t just make travel easier, it’s the only way to make this lifestyle possible. Fortunately, as a tech reviewer, I’m able to test just about every travel gadget you can imagine.</p> <p>From beach towns in Asia to work trips in the US and Europe, these products are the reason I can pack light, stay productive and keep moving without losing my sanity. Whether you’re also living and working out of a backpack, or just want to stay connected on your next vacation, there’s something for you here.</p> <h2>Item trackers</h2> <p>If you <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us/travel">travel</a> nonstop, it’s only a matter of time before you misplace your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/18/best-carry-on-travel-bag-backpack-luggage">backpack</a>, wallet or phone. An item tracker can help you quickly relocate it in that heart-racing moment when you realize it’s gone.</p> <p>Apple users have a go-to option with the AirTag, but Android users may prefer Chipolo, which works on both platforms. I use the Chipolo Pop for its extra capabilities: it doubles as a remote camera shutter button, you can double-press it to find your smartphone, and more.</p> <p><strong>Apple Air</strong><strong>Tag</strong></p>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0CWXNS552" > $24.99 at Amazon </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag" > $29 at Apple </a>  <p><strong>Chipolo Pop</strong></p>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-pop-4-pack" > $29 at Chipolo </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0DZXRQX4T" > $29 at Amazon </a>  <p>Recently, I also started using the new Chipolo Loop because it offers USB-C charging so I don’t need to constantly swap batteries. I love my wallet’s slim Nomad Tracking Card for the same reason. It can be charged wirelessly, though it only supports iOS.</p> <p><strong>Chipolo Loop</strong></p>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://chipolo.net/en/products/chipolo-loop" > $39 at Chipolo </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0FLKHYLF7" > $39 at Amazon </a>  <p><strong>Nomad Tracking Card</strong></p>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/tracking-card" > $29 at Nomad </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0D5LC5C1K" > $29 at Amazon </a> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter-us/2025/oct/15/bungee-cords-travel-hacks">Bungee cords are an oddball hack for traveling – here are 10 clever ways to use them</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Peak Design packing cubes</h2>    <p>I am not the most organized person, and was never into organizers or packing cubes until I used the ones from Peak Design. After I fell in love with the small-size <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter-us/2025/oct/04/travel-essentials-packing-list-us">packing cube</a>, I eagerly bought a larger size. They help me stay organized on the go with smart design choices.</p> <p>For instance, you get dual compartments for separating clean and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter-us/2025/oct/07/laundry-detergent-sheets-hey-sunday-review">dirty clothes</a>, and a compression zipper for making additional space when needed. Peak Design claims its packing cubes can last decades. I’ve used them for two years, and they’re going strong.</p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0DHJCN963" > $23.96 at Amazon </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.peakdesign.com/global/products/packing-cube?Size=Small&amp;Color=Sage" > $29.95 at Peak Design </a>  <h2>Moment Tech Organizer</h2>    <p>I have way too many tiny gadgets, but the Moment Everything Tech Organizer helps me keep them all straight. From cable compartments to pockets for my GoPro and Insta360 batteries, it has designated space for all the essentials. The low-profile design doesn’t add extra bulk to my backpack, and the ripstop fabric with two-layer waterproofing helps against liquid damage, too.</p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.shopmoment.com/products/mtw-tech-organizer" > $60 at Moment </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B08DWC8HX4" > $40 at Amazon </a> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/09/xreal-one-ar-glasses-review">These glasses make economy class bearable with a virtual 147-inch screen</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</h2>    <p>The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 fit me extremely well, and offer excellent sound alongside surprisingly effective active noise cancellation (ANC). I love them because you can control playback, ANC and volume, and summon a voice assistant, all without a protruding stem design. They’ve helped me catch sleep on multiple long-haul flights. I’m testing the new Apple AirPods Pro 3 as we speak, which may rival these, but those are $249, and these are now marked down to $189, making them a great value.</p> <p><strong>Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</strong></p>    <a class="element element-link" href="amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-Cancellation/dp/B0D79ND3N7" > $189 at Amazon </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds_pro_2?hl=en-US" > $229 at Google </a>  <p><strong>Apple AirPods Pro 3</strong></p>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airpods/airpods-pro-3" > $249 at Apple </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG" > $249 at Amazon </a>  <h2>Insta360 X5 360-degree action camera</h2>    <p>I carry a pair of Ray-Ban Meta glasses for shooting first-person video footage, but they aren’t made to be worn for adventures. And that’s where the Insta360 X5 comes in. It can record 360-degree footage in 8K resolution with unique perspectives, which isn’t possible with a phone or a pair of sunglasses. The latest generation has improved low-light footage, intuitive in-app editing and a replaceable lens design, so you can swap just the lens if you break it. It is expensive, but worth it if you want to record your travels from all-new perspectives.</p> <p><strong>Insta360 X5</strong></p>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://store.insta360.com/product/x5" > $549.99 at Insta360 </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Insta360-Waterproof-Replaceable-Built-Stabilization/dp/B0DZCBYCNY" > $549.99 at Amazon </a>  <p><strong>Ray-Ban Meta glasses</strong></p>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/wayfarer-shiny-black-clear/" > $299 at Meta </a>  <h2>Casio G-Shock 2100 Series</h2>    <p>I have a white Casio G-Shock 2100 Series GA-2100-7A7, which goes with me everywhere. From surfing lessons at the Mantra Surf Club in India to kayaking in Sri Lanka or work-focused travels to the US and Europe, this G-Shock has been on my wrist for every type of outing. This G-Shock is sporty, comfortable to wear, easy to switch between time zones with a few button presses, and looks premium without costing a lot.</p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.casio.com/us/watches/gshock/product.GA-2100-7A7/" > $110 at Casio </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.reeds.com/casio-g-shock-analog-digital-carbon-core-guard-tone-on-tone-white-resin-strap-watch-ga2100-7a7-plu20429080.html" > $110 at Reed’s Jewelers </a> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/sep/24/best-road-trip-guide-gear-accessories">From phone chargers to podcasts, the best road trip accessories make the miles fly by</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Apple MacBook Air M4</h2>    <p>The Apple M2 MacBook Air has been the most reliable laptop in terms of battery life and usability for me in the past few years. I’m recommending the M4 model because it packs more power and better value for the money in 2025. As a digital nomad, I want my laptop to be lightweight and ready whenever I need it, and the Apple MacBook Air conveniently checks both boxes. For Windows fans, I love and recommend the Asus Zenbook A14, which is even lighter and offers longer battery life than the Apple laptop.</p> <p><strong>Apple MacBook Air M4</strong></p>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air" > $899 at Apple </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC" > $899 at Apple </a>  <p><strong>Asus Zenbook A14</strong></p>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0DV9YB8PP" > $879 at Amazon </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/asus-zenbook-a14-14-fhd-oled-laptop-copilot-pc-snapdragon-x-plus-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-zabriskie-beige/JJGGLH86J4" > $999.99 at Best Buy </a>
