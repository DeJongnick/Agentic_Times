<p><strong>Juventus</strong> lost 1-0 at <strong>Lazio</strong> in Serie A on Sunday to pile more pressure on their coach, Igor Tudor. The Bianconeri have not won in any competition since 13 September, when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/13/european-football-kylian-mbappe-lifts-10-man-real-madrid-past-real-sociedad">they defeated Inter 4-3</a>, and they went a fourth successive match without scoring a goal as they lost in Rome.</p> <p>A mistake from the Juventus forward Jonathan David led to Lazio’s goal in the ninth minute. The Canada international was deep in his own half and under no pressure when he headed the ball to the home side’s Danilo Cataldi, who laid it off to Toma Basic to drive into the bottom right corner.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/25/european-football-bayerns-lucky-13-as-kimmich-breaks-down-10-man-gladbach">European football: Bayern’s lucky 13 as Kimmich breaks down 10-man Gladbach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Juventus were fortunate that Weston McKennie was not sent off in the 57th minute after he appeared to push over Mattéo Guendouzi, who was furious. McKennie had been booked three minutes earlier but the USA international avoided getting another yellow card and being sent off. It was Lazio’s first win in nearly a month.</p> <p><strong>Roma </strong>kept pace with Napoli at the top of the table after a 1-0 win at <strong>Sassuolo</strong>, with Paulo Dybala’s 16th-minute goal on the rebound securing all three points. <strong>Bologna </strong>let a two-goal lead slip at <strong>Fiorentina</strong>, who stay winless but battled back for a point through Moise Kean’s late penalty after Emil Holm was sent off for the visitors.</p>    <p><strong>Torino </strong>fought back from a goal down at half-time to beat lowly <strong>Genoa </strong>2-1 at home, with the defender Guillermo Máripan volleying the late winner from a corner. <strong>Verona</strong> also stay winless as they drew 2-2 at home against <strong>Cagliari</strong>, having been 2-0 up with 15 minutes to go.</p> <p>In Ligue 1, the fourth-placed <strong>Lille </strong>put six past <strong>Metz</strong>, with Félix Correia scoring twice. Hamza Igamane, Romain Perraud, Benjamin André and Hákon Haraldsson were also on target in a 6-1 rout that keeps the bottom club stuck on two points.</p> <p><strong>Nice </strong>moved above <strong>Rennes </strong>in mid-table as Jonathan Clauss’s opportunistic finish proved to be decisive in a 2-1 away win. In two games featuring sides in the relegation picture, <strong>Angers </strong>defeated <strong>Lorient </strong>2-0 at home, while <strong>Le Havre </strong>won 1-0 at <strong>Auxerre.</strong></p> <p><strong>Bayer Leverkusen </strong>secured their fourth successive Bundesliga win with a 2-0 home win against Freiburg. Ernest Poku’s fine finish and a header from Edmond Tapsoba sealed victory for Kasper Hjulmand’s side. Elsewhere, <strong>Stuttgart </strong>are up to third after fighting back to beat <strong>Mainz </strong>2-1 at home, Deniz Undav scoring an 80th-minute winner.</p> <p>In the Eredivisie, Ismael Saibari hit a hat-trick as <strong>PSV </strong>edged a top-of-the-table battle with <strong>Feyenoord</strong>, winning 3-2 to move level with their hosts on 25 points. <strong>Ajax </strong>are fourth after three goals in seven minutes secured a 3-2 victory at <strong>Utrecht</strong>.</p>
