<p>Great that you featured <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2023/nov/30/northern-ballet-nutcracker-grand-theatre-leeds-in-pictures">Northern Ballet’s Nutcracker</a> as a double-page photo spread in your print edition, mentioning that Tchaikovsky’s music is still “played live” (Eyewitness, 30 November). What a pity you didn’t mention that Northern Ballet plans to use recorded music in future and that it has already had its soon-to-be-redundant Sinfonia making the necessary recordings. For the musicians this is akin to signing their own death warrant. Are the dancers now to be automatons too?
