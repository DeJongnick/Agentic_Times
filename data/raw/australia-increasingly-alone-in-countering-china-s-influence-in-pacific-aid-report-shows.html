<p>Australia is “increasingly alone” in countering Beijing’s influence in the Pacific and remains the largest foreign aid donor to the region as the US and other western partners cut funding, a new report shows.</p> <p>The 2025 Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map, released late on Sunday, tracks official development finance (ODF) from 2008 to 2023. It finds ODF to the Pacific fell by 16% in 2023 to US$3.6bn, marking a second consecutive year of record decline in development support.</p> <p>Australia makes up 43% of official development finance in the region, four times more than New Zealand in second.</p> <p>“Australia’s steady aid spending and rapid expansion in infrastructure lending looks set to cushion the Pacific from the impact of major donor cuts,” said lead author Riley Duke.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/02/vanuatu-open-to-signing-deal-with-australia-but-will-not-be-subject-to-bullying-from-larger-countries">Vanuatu open to signing deal with Australia but will not be subject to ‘bullying’ from larger countries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Preliminary data and forecasts have been used for 2024 through to 2028, after the Trump administration gutting foreign aid and Australia stepping up to plug the gaps in the Pacific.</p> <p>The dismantling of USAID by Donald Trump has had a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/donald-trump-usaid-withdrawal-impact-pacific-explainer"> ripple effect across the Pacific</a>, leaving people and programmes with an uncertain future.</p> <p>But the report found while the impact of USAID cuts in the region had been overstated – which played into China’s narrative of US unreliability – it had hurt Washington’s standing in the region.</p> <p>“In the Pacific, the real cost of US aid cuts won’t be measured in lost dollars, but in lost trust,” said the Lowy map’s project lead, Alexandre Dayant.</p> <p>“While Washington steps back, Beijing is winning something far more strategic: narrative dominance. China is recasting itself as the steady, non-interventionist partner in a region where consistency counts.</p> <p>“For Australia, America’s withdrawal is more than inconvenient, it leaves Canberra increasingly alone in countering Chinese influence.”</p> <p>At the same time, the report’s authors say Australia’s dominant role in Pacific development is expanding.</p> <p>“By 2028, it will likely deliver more than double the combined support of Japan, New Zealand, the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom,” lead author Duke said.</p> <p>China has moved away from loan-financed infrastructure projects to grants and smaller community initiatives. This has allowed Beijing to strengthen political and grassroots ties while spending remains flat.</p> <p>“China now spends less than it did a decade ago, but its aid reaches far deeper into Pacific communities. Projects are smaller but more frequent and locally targeted,” Duke said.</p> <p>The aid map collates data from more than 38,000 projects, worth more than $80bn, from 76 development partners.</p> <p>Australia is also working with south Pacific nations including Chile, Fiji, France, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Tonga to better respond to natural disasters in the region.</p> <p>The Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, attended the 2025 South Pacific defence ministers’ meeting in Chile, where members agreed to push ahead with a Pacific response group decided the previous year.</p> <p>The next phase will create a year-round, shared location model with New Zealand taking command of the regional headquarters for two years starting in mid-2026.</p> <p><em>AAP contributed to this report</em></p>
