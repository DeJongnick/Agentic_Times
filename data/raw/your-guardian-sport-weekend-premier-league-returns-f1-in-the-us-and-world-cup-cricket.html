White-ball cricket as a warmup for the greatest Test series of them all may seem curious but the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka follows hot on the heels of the Ashes. On England’s last visit to Asia this year they lost 10 out of 11 matches, including seven from eight in India, but Harry Brook’s side are targeting the trophy he helped them win in Australia in 2022. Brook is back to lead the side after being rested last month in Ireland, where Jacob Bethell became England’s youngest men’s captain, aged 21, and guided them to a 2-0 T20 series win. When they last had a full complement, England became the first Test nation to score 300 in a men’s T20, with Phil Salt and Jos Buttler flaying South Africa’s bowlers to all parts at Old Trafford. Up early to helm our over-by-over coverage is <strong>James Wallace</strong>, with <strong>Simon Burton</strong> reporting from Hagley Oval.</p> <p>8am</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p><strong>Emillia Hawkins</strong> is at the controls of our essential gateway to the day’s football action. She will be looking ahead to Saturday’s seven Premier League fixtures, with the lunchtime kick-off at the City Ground, where Nottingham Forest face Chelsea at 12.30pm in a lively start to proceedings. There’ll be team news and breaking stories as well as any wash-up from Friday night’s Championship game between Middlesbrough and Ipswich. There are three lunchtime fixtures in the second tier, including the London derby between QPR and Millwall. Julien Stéphan’s hosts are on a six-match unbeaten streak that includes wins over Bristol City, Stoke and Charlton. Elsewhere, Borussia Dortmund’s undefeated run has filled Niko Kovac’s team with confidence for <em>Der Klassiker</em> at Harry Kane’s Bayern Munich despite the hosts’ impressive 10-match winning streak in all competitions.</p> <p>12pm</p> <p>Champions Day at Ascot live</p> <p>Racing</p>  <p>The latest instalment of the Ombudsman v Delacroix rivalry takes place at Ascot in a mouthwatering Champion Stakes. The former will be returning to the scene of his dazzling Prince of Wales’s Stakes triumph and has since struck gold in the Juddmonte International, where he levelled the score with Delacroix after Aidan O’Brien’s star son of Dubawi flew home late to deny John and Thady Gosden’s four-year-old in the Eclipse. Delacroix has since produced a spellbinding display to add to his own Group One haul on home soil in the Irish Champion Stakes and will now try to become only the seventh horse to complete the Anglo-Irish Champion Stakes double. <strong>Tony Paley</strong> has all the unfolding action on a day of compelling racing, with <strong>Greg Wood</strong> at Ascot.</p> <p>12.30pm</p> <p> Nottingham Forest v Chelsea live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Ange Postecoglou’s last stand? Forest host Chelsea as the noise builds around the Australian’s future at the City Ground. Zero wins from his seven games in charge is hardly grounds for confidence, mate. There is plenty of speculation pointing to ex-Forest player Sean Dyche replacing him in the dugout. It won’t help that Chelsea are something of a bogey team: Postecoglou lost all four of his Premier League games against the Blues during his two-year spell as Tottenham manager. That said, Enzo Maresca’s side – reeling from the news that Cole Palmer will be out for six weeks – have been shaky on the road with just three wins from their past 14 away league fixtures. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong> helms our live blog while <strong>Ben Fisher</strong> reports from the City Ground.</p>   <p>3pm</p> <p>Man City v Everton and Brighton v Newcastle live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p><strong>Barry Glendenning</strong>’s clockwatch steers you through the pick of the 3pm kick-offs. At the Etihad Stadium, Pep Guardiola’s City are aiming for three wins on the trot, their brio boosted by Erling Haaland’s hot streak. The Norway striker has scored in 10 successive appearances for club and country. Everton will be no pushovers, however. David Moyes is again working wonders in his second stint at the club, although they have been beaten in three of their four away games in all competitions this season. Two sides on nine points meet at the Amex, where Brighton have never been beaten by Newcastle in eight Premier League games. Eddie Howe’s visitors have been dully predictable on their travels, meanwhile, with all three games ending in goalless draws. <strong>John Brewin</strong> reports from Brighton, with <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong> our man at Manchester City.</p> <p>5.30pm</p> <p>Fulham v Arsenal live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Mikel Arteta’s pacesetters return from the international hiatus eager to maintain their momentum against a Fulham side who have lost their last two Premier League games, shipping three goals in both matches. Arsenal have an ominous record in London derbies, having only lost one of their last 18 in the league – that sole defeat coming in a 2-1 loss at Fulham in December 2023. <strong>Scott Murray</strong> helms our live blog, with <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> and <strong>Barney Ronay</strong> at Craven Cottage.</p> <p>10pm</p> <p>United States Grand Prix qualifying </p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>Days after retaining their constructors’ title, McLaren’s duelling duo of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris sweep into Texas looking warily in their rear-view mirrors for Max Verstappen. With six rounds of the world championship remaining, the title contenders are separated by just 22 points with the four-times champion adrift by 63 points, but revelling in his recent form after beating both McLarens in the past three races. In that time, the Dutchman has reduced a 104-point deficit to Piastri at the start of September by 41 points to turn a seemingly lost cause into a thrilling late, if unexpected, charge for a fifth title. If he succeeds, it will be a record for overturning a deficit. So the Circuit of the Americas is likely to be the scene of much drama as the two McLaren hot shots, in a car that has not been updated in recent weeks, strive to fend off the much-revised and hard-charging Red Bull. That there is a sprint race too on Saturday, the first of three remaining this year, only adds to the potential for shredded nerves in qualifying. <strong>Beau Dure</strong> steers our live lap-by-lap coverage with <strong>Giles Richards</strong> reporting.</p>   <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>8am</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p><strong>John Brewin</strong> and <strong>Michael Butler</strong> sift through the fallout from Saturday’s programme before our unmissable live football countdown blog looks forward to a Sunday fixture list that features Tottenham v Aston Villa and Liverpool v Manchester United in the Premier League as well as eight Women’s League Cup fixtures. In the Scottish Premiership, Celtic travel to Dundee for a midday kick-off while in La Liga Real Madrid are at Getafe in the pick of the European fixtures.</p> <p>10.30am</p> <p>India v England live</p> <p>Women’s Cricket World Cup</p>  <p>Rain saved England from a likely defeat against winless Pakistan on Wednesday. England slumped to 79 for seven before a first break of almost four hours led to the match being reduced to 31 overs per side. Charlie Dean (33) and Em Arlott (18) led a rally to 133 for nine but the target was revised downwards and looked well within Pakistan’s reach before another deluge. The no-result meant their unbeaten record in the competition was preserved. Next up are the co-hosts India in Indore and there is concern over the form of a number of players in what will be a decisive test of England’s championship ambitions. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong> and <strong>James Wallace</strong> are at the controls of our OBO live coverage, with <strong>Raf Nicholson</strong> reporting.</p>   <p>2pm</p> <p> Tottenham v Aston Villa live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Before the weekend fixtures, Spurs were sitting in a heady third place in the table after seven games and a win against Villa could see them go top if Arsenal and Liverpool drop points against Fulham and Manchester United. Thomas Frank has certainly made an impressive start as Tottenham manager but has struggled against Aston Villa. At Brentford, his side won only once in eight league games against them. In addition, Unai Emery’s side’s record against Spurs is impressive: four wins from their last six Premier League games. <strong>Michael Butler</strong> steers our live blog and <strong>Matt Hughes</strong> reports from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p> <p>2.30pm</p> <p>Jaguars-Rams, Vikings-Eagles, Chiefs-Raiders live</p> <p>NFL</p>  <p><strong>Graham Searles</strong> tracks all the American football action, with the clash of Los Angeles and Jacksonville at Wembley Stadium among the highlights of week seven. The Rams claimed a 17-3 victory against the Ravens last time out, but could be without their key receiver Puka Nacua in London, though the quarterback Matthew Stafford is forging a potent connection with the wide receiver Davante Adams. The Jaguars, meanwhile, lost 20-12 at home to Seattle last week and will look to Trevor Lawrence for inspiration.</p> <p>4.30pm</p> <p>Liverpool v Manchester United live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p><strong>Rob Smyth</strong> helms our minute-by-minute coverage of one of English football’s fiercest rivalries. The first doubts are beginning to emerge about Liverpool’s title defence on the back of three straight losses, two of them in the league, while Manchester United teeter from one crisis to another. Liverpool stumbled to late defeats against Crystal Palace and Chelsea before the international break, and another loss came in the Champions League. It is the club’s worst run under Arne Slot, who was near-faultless in his title-winning first season. Ruben Amorim, meanwhile, enjoyed some relative calm during the international break after backing from United’s co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe but finds himself back in the Premier League maelstrom once again. Victory against the out-of-sorts reigning champions would mean back-to-back league wins for the first time since Amorim took over nearly a year ago. <strong>David Hytner</strong> and <strong>Andy Hunter</strong> are our reporting team at Anfield.</p>   <p>8pm</p> <p>United States Grand Prix</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>Max Verstappen has reeled off four consecutive podium finishes and has won three of the last four Austin races, missing out only last year when Ferrari claimed a one-two, contenting himself instead with a sprint race win. For McLaren, Lando Norris took pole last year and finished fourth and is under pressure to beat his 24-year-old Australian teammate Oscar Piastri, and Verstappen if possible. The pressure is also on Piastri: the Australian has gone three races without a podium. His best result in Austin was fifth last year, after retiring following a crash in 2023. The tension at McLaren is likely to be matched at Ferrari after a fraught few days of reports suggesting that the team is in disarray and are lining up the former Red Bull controller Christian Horner as a possible successor to the under-pressure team chief, Fred Vasseur. Without a win this year, Ferrari and the seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, in particular, badly need a result in Texas. The Briton has gone 18 races without a top-three finish as he returns to a favourite circuit where he has won five times. Mercedes will also be hunting success after George Russell’s triumph in Singapore and the belated confirmation that they are retaining an unchanged lineup, with the Italian teenager Kimi Antonelli alongside Russell, next year. <strong>Beau Dure</strong> helms our lap-by-lap coverage and <strong>Giles Richards</strong> reports on the race. </p>
