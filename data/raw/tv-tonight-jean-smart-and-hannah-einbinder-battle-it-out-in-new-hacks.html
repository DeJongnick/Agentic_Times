<h2>Hacks</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Max</strong><strong><br></strong>Season four of the hit comedy arrives, and Deborah (Jean Smart) has the late-night hosting gig with Ava (Hannah Einbinder) as her head writer. Except it didn’t happen that easily – Ava had to use blackmail. Can they get the job done? With Deborah calling Ava the C-word “in that angry boomer way” and stitching her up by posting her “dirty panties” to new colleagues, that’s not likely. It’s all the better for our entertainment, though, and we’re rooting for them to pull this off. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Beyond Paradise</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>In textbook cosy-crime fashion, a batch of artisan chocolates have been poisoned, with the three victims being apparently unrelated residents of Shipton Abbott. Detectives Goodman and Williams (Kris Marshall and Zahra Ahmadi) investigate a case that suffers from a short list of suspects, but recovers with a neat howdunnit<em>. Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Gardeners’ World</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>As Neil from The Young Ones put it: first we sow the seeds, nature grows the seeds, and then we eat the seeds – ably illustrated here by Adam Frost amid his ornamental vegetable garden. Elsewhere, Rachel de Thame meets a magnolia grower, and Advolly Richmond visits Surrey landscape garden Painshill. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>What’s the Big Deal: Britain’s Best Buys?</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>Natalie Cassidy continues to test the buzziest shopping fads: this week, they include teeth-whitening products, the Ninja ice-cream maker, eco-friendly shower heads and barefoot shoes. She has an eager team of testers to help out and share their verdicts, too. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Black Snow</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong></p>    <p>Season two of the middling Aussie crime drama continues, kept afloat by a strong lead performance from Dune: Prophecy’s Travis Fimmel. Convinced that Zoe may still be alive and making those silent phone calls, Samara reaches out to her family. Meanwhile, Cormack seems to make a breakthrough in Ritchie’s case. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Austin</h2> <p><strong>9.30pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>Julian (Ben Miller) and Ingrid (Sally Phillips) go for lunch with his newly discovered son Austin (Michael Theo) and his mum (Gia Carides) – what could possibly go wrong with Ingrid meeting the woman with whom he had an affair and child? A very funny and heartwarming comedy. <em>HR</em></p>
