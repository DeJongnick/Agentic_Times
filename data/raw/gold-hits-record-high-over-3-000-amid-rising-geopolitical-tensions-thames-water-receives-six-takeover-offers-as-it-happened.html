consider water company demands for even higher bills</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The news that Thames Water has received six takeover proposals since last summer comes as regulator Ofwat asks the competition watchdog to consider requests from several other water companies to lift their bills even higher than has been allowed.</strong></p> <p>Ofwat is referring redetermination requests from <strong>Anglian</strong> <strong>Water</strong>, <strong>Northumbrian</strong> <strong>Water</strong>, <strong>South</strong> <strong>East</strong> <strong>Water</strong>, <strong>Southern</strong> <strong>Water</strong> and <strong>Wessex</strong> <strong>Water</strong> to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).</p> <p>The five companies are all challenging <strong>Ofwat’s</strong> ruling last year about how they can raise their bills between 2025 and 2030, arguing that the increase – 36% on average across the industry – wasn’t enough to invest in pipes, drains, reservoirs and treatment works.</p> <p><strong>Ofwat</strong> defends its decisions, saying:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The increase in investment means that customers’ bills will increase from 1 April; many customers are already expressing concerns about the level of increase.</p> <p>While the companies have not yet set out the details of their reasons for appealing, their initial statements highlight the need for additional funding beyond the substantial increase already allowed. This would mean a further increase in bills for customers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Interestingly, the regulator has also agreed a request from <strong>Thames</strong> <strong>Water</strong> to defer its referal to the CMA for up to 18 weeks. That delay, Thames says, will give it time to potentially “unlock a market-led solution for the recapitalisation of the Company” (presumably through one of the six offers on the table).</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67d96c7f8f0846970b3a2fc2" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-03-18T13:18:24.198Z">1.18pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Thames Water: We've received six takeover approaches</h2>  <div class="block-elements">    <p><strong>Thames Water has revealed it has received six approaches from potential suitors.</strong></p> <p>The struggling utility, which has been on the verge of collapse for months, says it has received proposals from six parties in response to a fundraising process launched in 2024, and that it “has since been conducting a detailed assessment of each proposal”.</p> <p><strong>Thames</strong> says that many of the proposals included its bond holders taking a hit:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The proposals involve a range of potential valuations, structures and outcomes for stakeholders. Of the five proposals that provided financial metrics, all except one (from a Class B Creditor and with significant conditions attached) indicated a material impairment of the Class A debt. </p> <p>The sixth proposal was for minority equity, intended to partner with investors, and did not set out financial metrics.</p> <p>In certain of the contemplated proposals, relevant creditors would receive – in exchange for debt impairment – certain rights to share in future growth in the value of the Company, and/or will have the ability to co-invest in the business.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Thames</strong> adds that most of the proposals are conditional on the company achieving various “regulatory support and accommodations” – a nod to its financial and operational problems, from a £19bn debt pile to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/16/thames-water-on-tv-pity-the-staff-this-place-is-decrepit">crumbling infrastructure</a>.</p> <p>It explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Discussions with relevant parties are ongoing, although there is no certainty that a binding equity proposal will be forthcoming or that any such proposals will be capable of being implemented.

Two oil price shocks, in 1973 and 1979, stoked inflation and investors took fright from paper assets and promises, such as government debt, and sought out ‘real’ assets where supply only grew slowly instead.</p> <p>“The second took place in the early 2000s, as central banks played increasingly fast and easy with monetary policy in response to a series of crises, real or perceived. They ranged from the collapse of the LTCM hedge fund in 1998, the millennium IT bug, the collapse of the technology, media and telecoms bubble and then the Great Financial Crisis and the European Debt Crisis. Record-low interest rates and Quantitative Easing followed, to persuade some investors that central banks and policymakers had lost control, just as it seemed they had in the 1970s.</p> <p>“The third, and current surge, has its origins in the last decade, as central banks continued to run zero-interest rate policies and did little to sterilise QE. Then came the Covid pandemic, and a crisis for which already-tattered government balance sheets were, in many cases, ill-prepared. Government borrowing surged, especially in the UK and USA, and in the latter the federal debt has continued to grow at an unprecedented pace. The result is that the annual interest bill is now $1.2 trillion, or more than a fifth of the federal tax take, a situation that seems unsustainable.
