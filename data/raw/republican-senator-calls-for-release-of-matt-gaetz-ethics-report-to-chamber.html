<p>Discussion on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s selection of Matt Gaetz, the former Florida congressman who has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/18/matt-gaetz-ethics-misconduct">accused of sexual misconduct</a>, for US attorney general continued on Sunday, with the Republican senator Markwayne Mullin calling for an unreleased ethics report to be released to the Senate.</p> <p>Mullin told NBC’s Meet the Press that the Senate, which will oversee Gaetz’s confirmation hearings to become attorney general, “should have access to that” but declined to say if it should be released publicly.</p> <p>Gaetz resigned from his seat in Congress on Wednesday soon after the president-elect made his controversial pick, frustrating plans by a congressional ethics panel to release a review of claims against Gaetz, including sexual misconduct and illegal drug use. Gaetz denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p>Republican House speaker Mike Johnson repeated his position on Sunday that the survey should remain out of the public realm. Gaetz had faced a three-year justice department investigation into the same allegations that concluded without criminal charges being brought.</p> <p>Johnson said the principle was that the ethics committee’s jurisdiction did not extend to non-members of the House. “There have been, I understand, I think, two exceptions to the rule over the whole history of Congress and the history of the ethics committee,” Johnson told CNN, adding that while he did not have the authority to stop it “we don’t want to go down that road.”</p> <p>Trump’s selection of Gaetz, while successfully provoking Democrats’ outrage, is also seen as a test for Republicans to bend Trump’s force of will. Mullin has previously noted situations in which Gaetz had allegedly shown colleagues nude photographs of his sexual conquests and described him as “unprincipled”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/trump-cabinet-pete-hegseth-matt-gaetz-sexual-misconduct-allegations">Two Trump cabinet choices in jeopardy over sexual misconduct allegations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the senator said he had not made a decision on whether to support Gaetz in a confirmation vote. “I’m going to give him a fair shot just like any individual,” Mullin said.</p> <p>The pending report seems likely to emerge in some form after other senior Republicans, including senators Susan Collins, John Cornyn and Thom Tillis have all said they believe it should be shown to them.</p> <p>Separately, the Pennsylvania Democratic senator John Fetterman repeated his advice to members of his own party to not “freak out” over everything Trump does, pointing out that for at least the next two years, Republicans can “run the table”.</p> <p>Fetterman said he looked forward to reviewing some of Trump’s nominations but others “are just absolute trolls”, including Gaetz.</p> <p>For Democrats, who are still trying to figure out reasons for their devastating loss at the ballot box this month, their outrage at Trump’s nominations “gets the kind of thing that he wanted, like the freak-out”, Fetterman continued.</p> <p>“It’s still not even Thanksgiving yet and if we’re having meltdowns at every tweet or every appointment.”</p> <p>Democrats, Fetterman added, should be “more concerned” about Republicans being able “to run the table for the next two years. Those are the things you really want to be concerned about, not small tweets or, you know, random kinds of appointments.”</p> <p>But the Democratic senator-elect Adam Schiff told CNN that Gaetz was “not only unqualified, he is really disqualified” to become the country’s top lawyer.</p> <p>“Are we really going to have an attorney general [with] … credible allegations he was involved in child sex-trafficking, potential illicit drug use, obstruction of an investigation? Who has no experience serving in the justice department, only being investigated by it,” Schiff said.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 18 November 2024. An earlier version said that John Fetterman was re-elected in Pennsylvania this month. In fact he was elected in November 2022 and is not due for re-election until 2028.</p>
