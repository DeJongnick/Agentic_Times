<p>You report that experts have warned that adding levies to electricity bills to support low-carbon projects will make it more difficult for people to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/20/why-the-uks-electricity-costs-are-so-high-and-what-can-be-done-about-it">Why the UK’s electricity costs are so high – and what can be done about it, 20 April</a>).</p> <p>One way to reduce those levies dramatically would be to scrap all planned nuclear power stations. These include the crazily expensive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/14/sizewell-c-cost-nuclear-power-plant-edf">Sizewell C</a>, which has already <a href="https://www.sizewellc.com/proposals/funding-sizewell-c/">received nearly 2.5bn in subsidies</a> before it has even started construction and which will cost the bill payer dear, even without the inevitable huge cost overruns that the French-state-owned EDF always incurs (think Flamanville and Hinkley C); and the four, possibly six, new reactors to be built on a flood plain on the River Severn at Oldbury in Gloucestershire.</p> <p>These latter reactors are still at an early design stage, will have to go through years of safety approval before construction can start, and, being of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/06/what-are-small-modular-reactors-and-why-does-uk-want-to-build-them">an uncertain and novel design</a>, will end up costing the bill payer a fortune in subsidies. And then there’s the unquantifiable cost of decommissioning and trying to deal with the highly radioactive waste.</p> <p>The energy minister, Ed Miliband, has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-61021214">publicly expressed doubts</a> in the past about the wisdom of subsidising nuclear power at the expense of renewables. Now is the time for him to scrap all plans for this unaffordable and dangerous way to boil water, and invest in renewables, including tidal power.<br><strong>John French</strong> <br><em>Stand (Severnside Together Against Nuclear Development) </em></p> <p>• Your report says that “by generating more electricity from renewable energy and nuclear reactors, electricity costs would begin to fall”. All reliable recent studies demonstrate this is so for renewables, but not so for nuclear, if the full costs of uranium mining, milling, enrichment, fuel fabrication, radioactive waste management and nuclear facility decommissioning are taken into account.</p> <p>To illustrate this, a very recent <a href="https://www.hanford.gov/files.cfm/2025_Lifecycle_Scope,_Schedyle_and_Cost_Report.pdf">report from the US Department of Energy</a> projects to final clean-up costs of Hanford, the US equivalent of Sellafield, but bigger, is an extraordinary $589bn. These huge sums need to be factored into nuclear power’s costs to give the real price of power from splitting the atom.<br><strong>Dr David Lowry<br></strong><em>Co-author, The International Politics of Nuclear Waste</em></p>
