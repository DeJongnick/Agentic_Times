<p>Matt Powell suggests the Sycamore Gap vandals be punished by an order to plant 2,000 trees each, describing this as “loathsome, back-breaking work” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/14/sycamore-gap-tree-duo-do-not-belong-in-prison">Letters, 14 May</a>). It’s a creative idea but, as a former forestry worker with years of tree-planting experience and a fine, unbroken back, I take issue with his description. It’s healthy work, far more satisfying than many jobs, and planting 2,000 trees would only be about 10 hours’ work at a reasonable pace.<br><strong>Nic Pease</strong><br><em>Inchigeela, County Cork, Ireland</em></p> <p>• Jane Lowe wonders if she and her husband were “sten party” trendsetters in 1979 (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/may/18/were-we-sten-party-trendsetters-in-1979">Letters, 18 May</a>).

On the evening before my wedding, my female colleagues treated me to a meal out and referred to the event as “Iain’s hag party”.
