<p>The parliamentary standards commissioner has denied reports that a Scottish National party MP has been cleared of bullying the former cabinet minister Nadine Dorries and said the investigation is ongoing.</p> <p>The SNP’s culture spokesperson, John Nicolson, was reported – including by the Guardian – to have been cleared of cyberbullying after a six-month long investigation by parliament’s independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS).</p> <p>The ICGS reportedly assessed a series of tweets Nicolson sent about Dorries while she was culture secretary in Boris Johnson’s cabinet.</p> <p>Nicolson called Dorries “a horrible disgusting woman”, “a “mendacious, vacuous Tory goon” and “thick as two short planks”.</p> <p>But Daniel Greenberg said on Thursday the investigation was ongoing. “Following a request from both parties to the investigation and in response to recent media reporting, I am taking the unusual step of using my powers to correct the record,” he said.</p> <p>“The investigation in the case referred to in recent media reports is ongoing, and no decision has yet been made.”</p> <p>Nicolson liked the tweets posted by others after the pair engaged in a Commons select committee session, during which he questioned Dorries on her use of Twitter.</p> <p>After a number of exchanges during the digital, culture, media and sport committee hearing in November 2021, she said she was “not going to answer questions about tweets that I posted 12 years ago, or whenever it was”.</p> <p>At one point, Nicolson said: “It is hard to keep track of your tweets”, to which Dorries replied: “Not as hard as it is to keep track of yours.”</p> <p>The case marks the first time a British politician has been investigated by the ICGS over allegations of cyberbullying another MP. The ICGS was created in 2018 to get a grip on misconduct within parliament.</p> <p>A House of Commons spokesperson said: “Parliament’s ICGS operates on the basis of confidentiality for the benefit of all parties. Therefore, we cannot provide any information on any complaint, including whether or not a complaint has been received.”</p>
