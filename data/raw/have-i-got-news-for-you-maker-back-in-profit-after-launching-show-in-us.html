<p>The production company behind Have I Got News For You has bounced back into the black after launching the hit panel show in the US for the first time.</p> <p>Hat Trick, which also makes Mastermind, Derry Girls and Whose Line is it Anyway?, reported pre-tax profits of almost £857,000 last year. In 2023, the company reported a pre-tax loss of £377,000.</p> <p>However, turnover at the company, the maker of hits including Father Ted, Trigger Point and Outnumbered, fell almost 28% from £48.4m to £35m year on year.</p> <p>The return to profit came as Hat Trick successfully debuted a 10-episode series of Have I Got News for You in the US on CNN in the run-up to last November’s US presidential election, with a further 20 episodes running this year.</p>    <p>The number of series produced, a key measure of the company’s performance, rose from seven to 10 last year.</p> <p>In total, the London-based company paid out an interim dividend of £1m, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/11/tv-producer-hat-trick-42m-jimmy-mulville-karen#:~:text=TV%20producer%20Hat%20Trick%20pays,Independent%20production%20companies%20%7C%20The%20Guardian">down on the £4.7m in 2023</a>.</p> <p>Of this, £900,000 was paid to Jimmy Mulville and his wife, Karen, who received a £4.2m payout in 2023, while the chair, Patrick McKenna, received £100,000.</p> <p>Hat Trick was founded in 1986 by Mulville – an aspiring standup turned TV executive – and his ex-wife, Denise O’Donoghue, who together created comedy shows including Drop the Dead Donkey and Room 101 before her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/31/independentproductioncompanies.citynews">departure</a> from the company in 2005.</p> <p>Earlier this year Mulville spoke about his attempt to “buy out” Graham Linehan from a planned Father Ted musical. Mulville said Linehan, the co-creator of the hit series that ran between 1995 and 1998, refused to grant Hat Trick permission to make it even if he “drops dead”.</p> <p>In light of Linehan’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/05/graham-linehan-told-police-trans-teenager-taunted-him-about-divorce-trial-hears">activism and outspoken views on transgender issues</a>, Mulville said he suggested to him the controversy would be a hindrance to getting the Father Ted musical into theatres.</p> <p>“The book and the songs were written, and we were ready to go but that’s when it all turned very sour,” he told the Insiders: The TV Podcast, which he co-hosts with the TV executive Peter Fincham. “I had a conversation with Graham in which I said: ‘Look, this show isn’t going to get made with your name on it, there’s no reputable theatre that will make it.’</p> <p>“Things went from bad to worse … he even said that if he drops dead it’s in his will that we can’t do the musical.”</p> <p>Linehan has previously said he was “prepared to minimise my involvement, just coming along to the odd rehearsal to see how it was going. ‘No,’ I was told; they wanted a clean break.” He ultimately rejected a proposed deal, which he described as an “insult”.</p> <p>Last month Linehan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/05/graham-linehan-told-police-trans-teenager-taunted-him-about-divorce-trial-hears">appeared in court to face</a> charges of criminal damage and harassing a teenager, which he denies.</p>
