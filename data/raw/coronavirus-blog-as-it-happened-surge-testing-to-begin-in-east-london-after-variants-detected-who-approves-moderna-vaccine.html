  <p>The Duke of Sussex has expressed pride that his Sentebale charity has managed to continue helping children in <strong>Africa </strong>during a year which “hasn’t been easy” due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> 
  <p>Prince Harry co-founded Sentebale in 2006 to help vulnerable children in Lesotho, Botswana and Malawi, including those who are affected by extreme poverty and the HIV/Aids epidemic, PA reports.</p> 
  <p>Covid-19 meant that tried-and-tested programmes, which involve people coming together in groups, were ruled out at a time when support for children and young people was “needed more than ever”, Harry and Sentebale co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho stated.</p> 
  <p>The princes said: “Our role as a communicator was a valuable asset, enabling us to reach out and support communities when they needed it most.</p> 
  <p>“Despite limited resources, we are proud to say that Sentebale stepped up to meet the moment.</p> 
  <p>“This is a testament to our staff and volunteers - to their creativity, flexibility, and passion.</p> 
  <p>“As we begin recovering from Covid-19, now is also the time for Sentebale to look to the future and the role we will and must play.” <br></p>

  <p>The festival was making a return in the city, where Covid-19 first emerged, after it was forced to be online only last year due to lockdown restrictions.</p> 
  <p>A representative for the organisers told Reuters that numbers were being restricted this year, adding that around 11,000 people were there on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>Barriers were set up in front of each stage and security personnel restricted numbers in those areas. Some spectators wore masks, but many did not.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan </strong>has detected three cases of the <strong>Indian </strong>Covid-19 variant in people who had not travelled.</p> 
  <p>“Two cases were recorded in Amman and one in Zarqa in people who did not travel, which confirms that the emergence of mutated cases does not necessarily have to come from outside, but rather as a result of specific reproduction,” health minister Firas Al-Hawari told Al Mamlaka TV.</p> 
  <p>Jordan recorded on Saturday 704 cases of Covid-19 with 35 deaths, bringing the total cases detected in the kingdom to 712,077 with 8,871 deaths, according to the health ministry, Reuters reports.</p>

  <p><strong>Australia </strong>received its first delivery of Covid-19 vaccines in mid-February and has begun the mammoth task of immunising every willing adult in the country.</p> 
  <p>Repeated delays to Australia’s vaccine rollout – triggered by supply issues, logistical failures and changing health advice – have dramatically reshaped the government’s plan for vaccinating Australians.</p> 
  <p>The target of fully vaccinating the entire population by the end of October has been pushed back and the changing advice surrounding the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/astrazeneca">AstraZeneca</a> and associated blood-clotting risks for younger Australians has meant Pfizer vaccines are preferred for that cohort.<br></p>

   <p>Shah joined volunteers from one of Britain’s largest Hindu temples who set out to raise £500,000 by racking up 7,600 kilometers (4,722 miles) on stationary bikes — roughly the distance from London to Delhi — in 48 hours.</p>

  <p>“I think every single person of Indian origin will have someone affected over there,” Shah, 40, said outside the temple in London.</p>

  <p>A potential for coronavirus cases to “reignite” remains as many adults are still unvaccinated, a former chief scientific adviser to the <strong>UK’s </strong>government has warned.</p> 
  <p>Professor Sir Mark Walport, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the country was on the cusp of being able to loosen more restrictions.</p> 
  <p>But he warned that, with around 35% of adults not yet vaccinated, there was the potential for the “spark to reignite” and cases to rise again.</p> 
  <p>Prof Walport added: “We are on the cusp of being able to move to the next step of relaxation, it’s absolutely right that vaccines have been spectacularly successful but not everybody is protected.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ve got 35% of adults who are not vaccinated and 60% who have only had one dose and the truth is the virus has not gone away.</p> 
   <p>“The mistake that has been made repeatedly really is relaxing just slightly too early. What we need to do is get the numbers right down, it’s important that we don’t act as an incubator for variant cases that might be able to resist immunity.”</p>

  <p>Pope Francis kicked off a month-long marathon of worldwide Roman Catholic prayer on Saturday to ask God for an end to the Covid-19 pandemic and said money spent on armaments should be used instead to prevent future outbreaks.</p> 
  <p>Francis presided at the recital of the rosary in St. Peter’s Basilica on the first day of May, a month Roman Catholics traditionally dedicate to daily prayer to the Madonna, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>Each day during the month, Roman Catholics have been asked to pray for a specific category of people affected by the pandemic, such as those who were unable to say goodbye to their dying loved ones, health workers, the poor, the homeless and those thrown into economic difficulty.</p> 
  <p>The pope prayed that “this difficult trial ends and that horizons of hope and peace return”.</p>

  <p><strong>Pakistan </strong>will reduce the number of international flights by 80 per cent to help curb rising Covid-19 cases, the government said on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>The restrictions will come into effect on May 5 and will run to May 20, Pakistan’s Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement, though it did not specify which flights or destinations would be affected by the measure, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>The controls will be reviewed on May 18, the government said in a statement endorsed by the National Command Operation Center (NCOC), which oversees Pakistan’s response to the pandemic.</p> 
  <p>The restrictions will be applied to chartered and private flights as well as scheduled services.</p> 
  <p>All international passengers upon arrival at Pakistani airports on remaining services would be required to undergo rapid antigen testing (RAT) and will also have to show an RT-PCR test conducted within 72 hours before boarding a Pakistan-bound flight.</p> 
  <p>Passengers with a negative Covid-19 test will still undergo self-quarantine at home for 10 days, and those found positive will be shifted to a self-paid facility for the same period of time. Inbound passengers will also need to download an app on to their phones to help monitor their movements.</p> 
  <p>There will be exemptions on these controls for children younger than 12 years old, disabled persons, high-level international dignities and Pakistani deportees.</p>

   <p>The so-called “Boum 2” protest, organised online, is a follow-up to an action last month that was broken up by police with horses and water cannon, causing injuries. Ahead of the event, prime minister Alexander de Croo had urged the crowds to stay away, and hundreds of officers were deployed.</p> 
   <p>By late afternoon, AFP reporters in the Bois de la Cambre, a large park in the city, saw fireworks set off and some missiles thrown as police moved in. “We’re here to protect our freedom. Masks? I don’t wear them anymore. I want to be free,” said an 18-year-old high schooler from Flanders.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>As a police car rolled on to the grass close to the heart of the gathering, the merry-makers chanted: “Freedom, Freedom.” A helicopter and a drone hovered overhead, but the protesters’ music all but drowned out police demands for masking and social distancing.</p> 
   <p>“It’s been a year,” a 21-year-old from the capital told AFP. “A whole year we can’t go out. After a while you need an alternative.”</p> 
   <p>Belgium is under its second national lockdown as a coronavirus prevention measure and bars and restaurants have been shut since late October. But a vaccination drive is picking up speed and outdoor dining and drinking is due to resume on 8 May, and authorities have appealed for calm.</p> 
   <p>Norton, a 23-year-old cook who has lost his restaurant job, said the plan was not to provoke violence but to demand an end to what he called “illogical” anti-virus measures.</p>

  <p>Experts have warned of backlogs of undiagnosed dementia cases and worsening standards of care after official figures revealed a collapse in assessing and monitoring patients in <strong>England</strong> during the pandemic.</p> 
  <p>NHS data shows the number of people who were assessed for dementia has fallen to less than half the level before the pandemic – 10,535 in February 2021 compared to 23,392 in February 2020.</p> 
  <p>In that time, the number of people receiving an initial memory assessment fell by two-thirds, while the number of referrals to memory clinics – which help diagnose dementia – fell by 42%. Partly as a result, the total number of patients aged over 65 with a dementia diagnosis fell by just over 43,000 – a drop of 10%.</p> 
  <p>“When I talk to people with dementia, their families, the absolute lack of contact and support is very apparent, and accessing things like GPs has been a challenge,” said Paul Edwards, director of clinical services at Dementia UK.<br></p>

   <p>“And if you shut down, you don’t have to shut down for six months. You can shut down temporarily to put an end to the cycle of transmission,” he added. No one likes to lock down the country... But if you do it just for a few weeks, you could have a significant impact on the dynamics of the outbreak.”</p> 
   <p>Many states have imposed heavy restrictions on activity, particularly in the western state of Maharashtra and the capital New Delhi where hospitals are at breaking point. The capital extended its shutdown for another week today.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Netherlands</strong> has delayed its next phase of lockdown easing by at least a week as cases and pressure on hospitals remains high.</p> 
  <p>“We are passing the peak of the third wave. But the decline [of the infection rate] is not strong enough yet,” health minister Hugo de Jonge said on Twitter.</p> 
  <p>Gyms, zoos and amusement parks had been due to reopen on 11 May, but this has now been postponed to at least 18 May, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>The country slightly relaxed its restrictions last week, lifting a night-time curfew and allowing bars and restaurants to serve small groups outdoors between midday and 6pm. </p> 
  <p>The number of coronavirus patients in Dutch intensive care wards has surged in recent weeks to its highest in a year as infections swelled to levels last seen at the start of the year.</p>

  <p>People are being urged to remain patient before the next relaxation of lockdown restrictions as there is still a possibility for coronavirus cases to “reignite”, amid reports that family and friends in <strong>England</strong> could be allowed to hug in just over a fortnight.</p> 
  <p>The success of the vaccine rollout and sharp reduction in coronavirus cases and deaths has led ministers to support the move, according to the Times. If approved, this would mark the first time that people in England have been allowed to have physical contact outside of their household or bubble for more than a year.</p>

   <p>If you are lucky enough to get one, it takes up to a week to get the result. Until it arrives, if you have a severe case of Covid and need hospitalisation, you can’t be admitted to a hospital because you don’t have the paperwork to prove you are positive.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Kenyan</strong> president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has lifted the lockdown he imposed last month, allowing for a reopening of bars and restaurants, religious services and schools, as the rate of infections eases in the east African country.</p> 
  <p>Reuters has the story:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Curbs on travel in the capital Nairobi and four surrounding counties are to be lifted, and schools will be allowed to reopen. Religious services will resume with some restrictions, while political gatherings would still be banned, he said in a speech.</p> 
   <p>An evening curfew that currently starts at 8pm will now be 10pm. The changes will be in effect from midnight on Saturday, Kenyatta said. Under the restrictions now being relaxed, Nairobi and surrounding counties were treated as one zone, with residents barred from traveling to other areas.</p> 
   <p>Cases in Kenya, the richest country in East Africa, have fallen from last month’s peak but it is still among the top five nations in Africa reporting new infections and deaths, according to a Reuters tracker.</p> 
   <p>Kenya reported 497 new infections and 17 deaths within the past 24 hours, according to the latest health ministry data released on Friday. Overall, the country of 53 million has recorded nearly 159,000 cases and around 2,700 deaths.</p>

   <p>“So that’s one stream of work, but we are also trying to offer help to our exhausted colleagues in India – doctors are overstretched, they’re working too hard.”</p> 
   <p>They are offering long-distant consultations and advice to patients who do not need critical care, and also analysing the results of tests conducted in Indian hospitals. Prof Singhal said that BAPIO’s telemedicine project so far had 250 volunteers, and they are aiming to get 1,000.</p> 
   <p>One way BAPIO volunteers are helping out remotely is by analysing the results of CT scans. Prof Singhal told Sky News: “A lot of people are getting scans but [the results] are not getting reported in a timely manner.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The travel ban preventing <strong>Australians</strong> in <strong>India</strong> from returning home could be subject to legal challenges, with lawyers and academics believing the extraordinary measure may breach the law.</p> 
  <p>Scott Morrison’s government has been condemned for its “outrageous” decision to introduce fines of up to $66,600 or five years in prison, or both, for anyone defying a travel ban preventing Australians returning home from India.</p> 
  <p>The travel ban officially begins on Monday, in what is believed to be the first time Australia has banned its own citizens from returning home.</p> 
  <p>Griffith University human rights law professor Sarah Joseph said the ban, implemented under the Biosecurity Act, must satisfy section 477 of that act, which states that the measure has to be “appropriate” and “no more restrictive or intrusive than is required in the circumstances”.</p>

  <p><strong>Hong Kong</strong> migrant worker groups have criticised plans to make coronavirus vaccines compulsory for all foreign domestic workers, labelling the move “discriminatory and unjust”.<br tabindex="-1"></p> 
  <p>AFP reports:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Health officials said they were planning to roll out mandatory inoculations for the 370,000 domestic helpers in the city, mostly poorly-paid women from the Philippines and Indonesia.</p> 
   <p>Those wanting to apply for work visas - or renew their current ones - would need to show they had been vaccinated, officials said Friday. If the plan goes ahead it would be the first time Hong Kong has directly tied working rights for foreigners to vaccines.</p> 
   <p>“This is clearly an act of discrimination and stigmatisation against migrant domestic workers,” said Dolores Balladares Pelaez, the chair of United Filipinos in Hong Kong.</p> 
   <p>Labour groups representing domestic workers said they were angered other foreigners – and locals working in environments such as care homes – were not also required to get vaccinated. “Again, we are being singled out and targeted,” Pelaez added.</p> 
   <p>Health officials announced the vaccination plan after two domestic helpers were found to be infected with one of the more virulent strains of the coronavirus. All domestic workers have also been ordered to get tested over the coming days – a measure that did not extend to the families they work for.</p> 
   <p>Hong Kong labour secretary, Law Chi-kwong, defended linking domestic worker visas to vaccination. “Of course they can choose not to work in Hong Kong as they are not Hong Kong residents,” Law said.</p>

  <p>Counting on an accelerating vaccination campaign to keep new infections in check, much of continental Europe has announced plans for a gradual exit from lockdown over the coming weeks as case numbers begin to fall. Here is where things stand:</p>

  <p>Director of public health in Liverpool, <strong>England</strong>, Matt Ashton has said it was “wonderful” to see the looks on clubbers’ faces as they returned to the dance floor at a pilot event for 3,000 people in the city.</p> 
  <p>PA Media reports:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>He told BBC Breakfast that the event gave a glimpse of what the future might hold but stressed it was still a scientific experiment about how more events could be opened in the future.</p> 
   <p>Ashton added: “This is a scientific experiment, both before and after the event people have to return to doing the things they are supposed to, so following the rules in place.</p> 
   <p>“We have to deal with Covid still as if it is still around because it is, even if it is at low levels, so we have to be cautious in our approach. And for me that’s why it is so important that we collect the science around this to allow us to do this safely and properly in the future.</p> 
   <p>“But it is still wonderful to see the looks on people’s faces as they were at the event last night. It just gives a glimpse of what think we think the future might hold.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Researchers at the event will gather evidence for the Events Research Programme (ERP) on how small and large-scale events could be permitted to safely reopen. </p> 
  <p>Attendees had to live within a Liverpool postcode and test negative to a Covid-19 lateral flow test to gain entry to the club, as well as undergo a more accurate PCR test after the event. </p> 
  <p>Ashton said pilot events like the club night in the city were crucial to opening up the economy again and letting people return to normal life. Asked if the data from the pilots will be crucial to opening up society again in late June, he said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Yeah, don’t forget this is a crucial part of our economy, in Liverpool it’s over 40% of our economic output, so it’s really important we start to get the economy opening again. But also just in terms of a return to normal life, all of us being social creatures and doing the things we want to do more.</p> 
   <p>So the evidence base is absolutely essential. This is going to be part I think of a longer journey of understanding how we live with Covid more safely in the future.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He added that people who tested positive following the pilot club night will be expected to self-isolate and then be followed up by contact tracers as normal.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Anybody who tests positive after the event would go back into normal self-isolation and we would follow them up and ask them where they have been and who they have been in contact with.</p> 
   <p>But the likelihood is if it is people who have attended the event then it will be through the event and that allows us to speak to other people about it as well.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>When asked if everyone at the event will be tracked afterwards and for how long he said: “Everybody who attended with a ticket, absolutely will be. We ask people to take a PCR [polymerase chain reaction] five days afterwards and that helps us identify any virus that happened as a result of the event. I’m not expecting any.”</p>

  <p><strong>Canada</strong> will start getting Pfizer Covid vaccines from the <strong>US</strong> next week, a company spokesperson said, in what is to be the first time the US has allowed that company’s jabs to be exported to Canada.</p> 
  <p>The Associated Press reports:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Despite Canada’s tightly woven commercial ties with the U.S., it has been getting Pfizer’s vaccines from Belgium until now because U.S. authorities had kept supplies made in the U.S. for domestic use.</p> 
   <p>Prime minister Justin Trudeau repeated yesterday that starting next week, Canada will be receiving 2 million doses a week from Pfizer alone.</p> 
   <p>Vaccinations have ramped up in Canada in recent months. Every adult in Quebec will be eligible to make a vaccine appointment on May 14 and in Ontario, Canada’s largest province, every adult can book an appointment starting May 24.</p> 
   <p>Trade-dependent Canada previously lagged on vaccinating its population of 38 million because it lacks the facilities to manufacture the vaccine itself.</p> 
   <p>Pfizer has delivered almost 160 million doses to the U.S. from its Kalamazoo, Michigan, plant and that figure is expected to reach 200 million by the end of May.</p>

  <p>Disneyland in <strong>California</strong>, <strong>US</strong>, reopened yesterday after an unprecedented 13-month closure, with hugs and handshakes with characters off limits, and parades and fireworks shows shelved to limit crowding.</p> 
  <p>The Associated Press has the story:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The world-famous theme park is admitting only state residents and operating under a limited capacity for now with visitors needing to wear masks and only being able to remove them to eat in designated areas. </p> 
   <p>The reopening highlights a big shift for the nation’s most populous state from just months ago when Covid cases were surging, hospitals were running out of ICU beds, and hundreds of people died from the virus each day.</p> 
   <p>Now, California has the country’s lowest rate of confirmed coronavirus infections and more than half of the population eligible for vaccination has received at least one dose.</p> 
   <p>Theme parks were among the last California businesses allowed to reopen, in contrast to states with fewer restrictions such as Florida, where Disney World’s Magic Kingdom resort has been up and running, though at lower-than-usual capacity, since July. </p> 
   <p>At an early morning flag ceremony, Disney chief executive Bob Chapek thanked the park’s employees, many who greeted each other with fist-bumps and bright-eyes, though their smiles were concealed by constellation face masks. He asked them to “bring the magic back” for visitors who were kept away during the 412-day closure.</p>

  <p><strong>Pakistan</strong> plans to reduce the number of inbound international flights to 20% of current numbers to curb rising Covid cases, the official body overseeing the country’s pandemic response said.</p> 
  <p>“In view of prevailing global and regional disease trends, Pakistan has decided to reduce inbound international travel from 5 May to 20 May,” said the National Command Operation Center (NCOC) on Twitter.</p> 
  <p>It was not immediately clear which routes and air carriers would be affected. The NCOC added the decision would be reviewed on 18 May.</p> 
  <p>Pakistan has seen record deaths in recent days from the coronavirus, and stricter restrictions on movement and gathering in public are planned for the upcoming Eid holiday. </p>

  <p>The <strong>Australian</strong> government is to introduce penalties including fines and jail time for anyone who tries to return home from <strong>India</strong>, with treasurer Josh Frydenberg defending the moves as “drastic” but needed.</p> 
  <p>The move comes after two Australian cricketers who had been in India returned home on Thursday after transiting through Qatar, despite the government earlier in the week banning all direct flights from Covid-ravaged India.</p> 
  <p>The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, announced the strengthening of border controls late last night, saying that anyone who attempted to defy the rules would be hit with fines of up to $66,600 or five years in prison, or both.</p>

  <p>Reuters reports that human rights groups have criticised the ban, suggesting the government’s focus should be on improving its quarantine system, not on punishment.</p> 
  <p>“This is an outrageous response. Australians have a right of return to their own country,” Human Rights Watch’s Australia director, Elaine Pearson said in a statement. “The government should be looking for ways to safely quarantine Australians returning from India, instead of focusing their efforts on prison sentences and harsh punishments.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">India daily cases top 400,000 for first time, government 'ignored warnings on variant'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>India</strong> has posted a record daily rise of 401,993 new coronavirus cases today as the country opened up its humungous vaccination drive to all adults, although several states warned of acute shortages.</p> 
  <p>Reuters has the story:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It was the first time India’s daily case count had topped 400,000 after 10 consecutive days over 300,000. Deaths related to Covid-19 jumped by 3,523 over the past 24 hours, taking the total toll to 211,853, according to official data.</p> 
   <p>The world’s biggest producer of Covid-19 vaccines has a limited number of shots available, worsening a grim second wave of infections that has overwhelmed hospitals and morgues while families scramble for scarce medicines and oxygen.</p> 
   <p>The chief minister of the hard-hit state of Delhi yesterday implored people not to queue at vaccination centres, promising more vaccines would arrive “tomorrow or the day after”.</p> 
   <p>India’s eastern Odisha state said it had received a consignment of 150,000 shots but would only allow a few people to get shots due to lockdown restrictions preventing movement.</p> 
   <p>Meanwhile, a fire in a hospital about 115 miles south of Ahmedabad killed 16 coronavirus patients and two staff, the latest in a series of deadly accidents at hospitals.</p> 
   <p>A forum of scientific advisers set up by Modi administration warned Indian officials in early March of a new and more contagious variant of the coronavirus taking hold in the country, five scientists who are part of the forum told Reuters.</p> 
   <p>Despite the warning, four of the scientists said the federal government did not seek to impose major restrictions to contain the spread of the virus. Millions, largely unmasked, attended religious gatherings and election rallies that were held by Modi, leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and opposition politicians.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">England Covid rule that ‘turned care homes into prisons’ to be scrapped</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone reading. I’m Mattha Busby, here bringing you global coronavirus updates for the next couple of hours. </p> 
  <p>My colleague Peter Walker has the latest on the scrapping of a rule forcing care home residents in England who go on any sort of outside visit to then spend two weeks in their room. One campaign group said the regulation had turned “care homes into prisons”.</p> 
  <p>Under new guidance to begin from Tuesday, those in care homes will not have to self-isolate if they leave the home to be in the garden of a relative or friend, or to visit outdoor spaces such as parks and beaches.</p> 
  <p>John’s Campaign, which is campaigning for better visiting rights, launched a legal challenge arguing that the mandatory self-isolation brought in three weeks ago, regardless of the age or health of the individual, was discriminatory and unlawful.<br></p> 
  <p>Law firm Leigh Day, which was helping John’s Campaign and other groups with the challenge, quoted the parents of a 30-year-old man with autism who lives in a home as saying they were unable to visit him because he did not understand why he could not go out with them, and became distressed.<br></p>
