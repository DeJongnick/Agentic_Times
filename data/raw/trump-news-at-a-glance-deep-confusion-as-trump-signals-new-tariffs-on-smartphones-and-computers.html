<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s tariff war has dived deeper into chaos after a cabinet official telegraphed new levies on semiconductors – a crucial component in electronic goods – just days after the Trump administration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/12/trump-administration-smartphones-computers-china-tariffs">exempted computers and smartphones</a> from reciprocal tariffs.</p> <p>Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said in an interview with NBC that the tariff exemption on several electronic devices was just temporary and that new duties would come in “a month or two”. Semiconductors would be targeted with new tariffs, he said.</p> <p>Trump was forced to intervene, saying he would lay out the new tariffs on Monday and any relief would be short-lived. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform, adding: “Especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!”</p> <p>Here are the key stories at a glance:</p>  <h2>US markets on rollercoaster as Trump says electronics were never exempt</h2>  <p>US stock markets were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/13/us-stock-markets-expected-to-recover-after-trump-drops-tariffs-on-mobiles">expected to stage a recovery after the announcement</a> of smartphone and computer tariff exemptions, and shares in Apple and chip maker Nvidia were on course to soar. That outlook could change and hinges on what Trump may announce on Monday.</p> <p>Trump denied they were ever actually exempt from tariffs because a previous tariff still exists on them. “There was no Tariff ‘exception’,” Trump said in a social media post on Sunday, adding that the levies were merely “moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/trump-warns-exemptions-on-smartphones-electronics-will-be-short-lived-promises-future-tariffs-president-china"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Hedge fund billionaire says US may face ‘worse than a recession’</h2>  <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio said he was worried <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news">the US</a> would experience “something worse than a recession” as a result of Trump’s trade policies. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/billionaire-investor-ray-dalio-is-worried-about-something-worse-than-recession-full-interview-237257285807">Speaking to</a> NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, the 75-year-old hedge fund manager said: “I think that right now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession. And I’m worried about something worse than a recession if this isn’t handled well.”</p> <p>He added: “We have something that’s much more profound. We have a breaking down of the monetary order. We are going to change the monetary order because we cannot spend the amounts of money.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/13/ray-dalio-trump-tariffs-recession"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>‘Everything’s fine with Elon,’ says Trump adviser Navarro after Musk calls him ‘moron’</h2>  <p>Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser to Trump, said he and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> were “great” after the president’s billionaire business adviser publicly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/musk-trump-tariffs">called him “a moron”</a> who was “dumber than a sack of bricks” over his stance on tariffs.</p> <p>“I’ve been called worse,” Navarro said Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press in some of his most extensive remarks about the insults Musk directed at him days earlier. Praising Musk’s role in the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge), Navarro added: “Everything’s fine with Elon.” Navarro’s evident attempt to be magnanimous came after Musk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/musk-trump-tariffs">criticized</a> Trump’s proposals for global tariffs, which the president has since set at 10% on all countries, with some nations receiving higher trade levies.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/13/trump-adviser-peter-navarro-elon-musk-feud"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Man in custody after Pennsylvania governor’s home set ablaze, say police</h2>  <p>Police say a person is in custody after a suspected arson fire at the mansion of Pennsylvania’s governor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/02/josh-shapiro-kamala-harris">Josh Shapiro</a>. No one was injured in the blaze but the fire damaged parts of the home where Shapiro and his family slept.</p> <p>Pennsylvania state police colonel Christopher Paris identified the man in custody as Cody Balmer, 38, of Harrisburg, and said the investigation was continuing. Francis Chardo, the Dauphin county district attorney, said forthcoming charges would include attempted murder, terrorism, attempted arson and aggravated assault.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/13/josh-shapiro-pennsylvania-governor-house-fire"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump is ‘fully fit’ and manages high cholesterol, says White House physician</h2>  <p>Donald Trump – who at 78 is the oldest person to ever be elected US president – controls high cholesterol with medication and has elevated blood pressure but is “fully fit”, White House physician Sean Barbabella said in a report released on Sunday, two days after Trump underwent a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/12/white-house-promises-details-as-donald-trump-oldest-president-in-us-history-has-medical-check-up">routine physical</a>.</p> <p>Barbabella wrote that Trump exhibited “excellent cognitive and physical health” and that he was up to date on all recommended vaccines.

Following the most recent cuts, groups representing survivors and even Democratic US senators say they have no clarity on how the program will continue to provide benefits.</p> <p>“This is bureaucratic cruelty,” said Michael Barasch, an attorney who represents thousands of first responders and survivors of the attacks. Barasch described people suffering post-traumatic stress disorder from picking up body parts after the attack, unsure of whether their medical services will continue. Other were cancer patients, anxious about what services they could access, he said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/13/trump-health-cuts-world-trade-center-program-911"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>US deports 10 more alleged gang members to El Salvador, says Rubio</h2>  <p>The US has deported another 10 people that it alleges are gang members to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/el-salvador">El Salvador</a>, secretary of state <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio">Marco Rubio</a> said on Sunday, a day before that country’s president, Nayib Bukele, is due to visit the White House. Rubio praised the alliance between Trump and Bukele as “an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere”.</p> <p>Trump administration officials have repeatedly made public statements alleging that detained immigrants are gang members – claims they have not backed up in court.

But it also opens up powerful possibilities for resistance,” they write. “To bet against the future on this scale – to bank on your bunker – is to betray, on the most basic level, our duties to one another, to the children we love, and to every other life form with whom we share a planetary home.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/13/end-times-fascism-far-right-trump-musk"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>What else happened today:</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Russia launched a deadly Palm Sunday attack on churchgoers in Ukraine.
