<p>In a segment<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/chiefs-kicker-harrison-butker-endorses-sen-josh-hawley-re-election-no-other-person-id-want-support"> last week</a>, Laura Ingraham could barely contain her glee when she announced that Harrison Butker had decided to venture into politics: a “move sure to drive the liberals crazy”.</p> <p>Butker, for those who aren’t aware, is a kicker with the Kansas City Chiefs – who are famous in non-sporty circles for being the team that Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, plays for. As well as being the highest-paid kicker in the NFL and the owner of a very impressive beard, Butker is what a polite person might call “traditional” and a more direct person might call “Taliban-adjacent”. He essentially thinks women should stay at home making sandwiches for their husbands and looking after their kids. In May, the athlete <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/15/harrison-butker-commencement-speech">caused a</a> stir when gave a commencement speech at Benedictine College, a Catholic private liberal arts school, espousing these views. In the same speech, Butker also denounced “dangerous gender ideologies”, called Pride month a “deadly sin”, and rattled off various other conservative talking points.</p> <p>Butker’s Benedictine speech caused enormous backlash but, predictably, it also made him a hero on the right. No longer was he just a guy who got paid millions of dollars to play ball, he was a fighter, valiantly opening up a new front in the never-ending culture war. Sales of his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/17/harrison-butker-jersey-speech">jersey surged.</a></p> <p>Now it seems Butker plans on riding his newfound notoriety all the way to the White House. Don’t worry, he hasn’t announced a campaign for president yet – though one imagines the thought has crossed his mind – but he has decided to dip his toes into the murky world of political financing.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone with a chip on their shoulder and some money in their pocket has a Pac these days</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the weekend, the kicker established a political action committee called <a href="https://www.uprightpac.org/">Upright Pac,</a> aimed at getting more Christians to vote. “We’re seeing our values under attack every day. In our schools, in the media, and even from our own government,” the website explains. “But we have a chance to fight back and reclaim the traditional values that have made this country great. That’s why UPRIGHT PAC was founded.”</p> <p>Butker announced the Pac shortly after he <a href="https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/chiefs-harrison-butker-endorses-sen-josh-hawley-for-reelection">officially endorsed</a> the far-right Missouri senator Josh Hawley for re-election. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/josh-hawley-feminism-men-pornography-video-games">Hawley is the guy</a> who raised a fist in solidarity to protesters during January 6 and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/21/josh-hawley-running-away-rioters-january-6">was then filmed fleeing</a> from those protesters when they violently breached the Capitol building. He also can’t stop <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/05/31/hawley-manhood-crisis-masculinity/">talking about</a> the “collapse of American manhood” and the supposed crisis of men retreating “into the enclave of idleness and pornography and video games”.</p> <p>While the Upright Pac website doesn’t explicitly mention Donald Trump, Butker told Ingraham on Thursday that he would be supporting the former president because of his stance on abortion. “I think Donald Trump is the most pro-life president,” Butker said. Which might make things awkward at Kansas City Chiefs socials since Swift endorsed Kamala Harris.</p> <p>With only weeks to go until the election, Butker’s new Pac is not going to make much difference when it comes to getting Trump elected. But who knows what it might achieve in the future. His decision to mobilize Christian voters via a Pac speaks to a broader issue: the oversized influence of special interest groups and influential individuals in shaping US politics.</p> <p>Back in 2010, the US supreme court’s controversial Citizens United ruling loosened restrictions on campaign finance law and enabled corporations and special interest groups to <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained">spend unlimited money on elections</a> as long as there was no direct coordination with political candidates or parties. This paved the way for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/17/when-is-a-campaign-not-a-campaign-when-its-a-super-pac">Super Pac funding vehicles</a>: basically fancy legal frameworks which enable big (and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/dark-money-campaign-financing-citizens-united">frequently dark</a>) money to be funnelled into campaigns. Jimmy Carter has called it legalised “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/03/carter-says-campaign-finance-2010-citizens-united-ruling-legalised-bribery">bribery</a>”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/15/harrison-butker-commencement-speech">Chiefs’ kicker Harrison Butker rails against Pride, Biden and working women in speech</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pacs have played an important role in this election cycle. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), for example, has spent more than $100m on federal elections so far this cycle and may have played a large part in unseating Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush – two of Congress’s <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/aipac-100-million">most vocal critics</a> of Israel’s conduct in Gaza. It also seems to have helped to sustain support for the war: a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/10/congress-member-pro-israel-donations-military-support">Guardian analysis</a> published in January found that the members of Congress who were the most supportive of Israel’s campaign in Gaza during the first six weeks of the war were politicians who had benefited from donations from pro-Israel groups like Aipac.</p> <p>And Aipac is far from the only group toppling politicians. It’s possible <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/01/crypto-super-pac-katie-porter-attack-ads">Fairshake Pac</a>, a Super Pac backed by the cryptocurrency industry, may have had a role in preventing Katie Porter from advancing in her run for US Senate in California earlier this year. Fairshake, backed by cryptocurrency industry leaders, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/28/fairshake-crypto-pac-katie-porter-ads-california-senate">spent millions</a> in the primary on ads urging cryptocurrency enthusiasts to vote against Porter. Elon Musk, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/16/elon-musk-donald-trump-donation-america-pac">donated roughly $75m</a> over the last three months to his pro-Trump America Pac.</p> <p>In short: Butker is in crowded company. Everyone with a chip on their shoulder and some money in their pocket has a Pac these days. If you want to buy friends and influence elections, they’re a must-have.</p> <p>And while it’s still early days for Butker’s Pac, he certainly seems to have a lot of support. The owner of the Kansas City Chiefs said on Wednesday that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/17/harrison-butker-political-action-committee-pac-chiefs-kicker">he had no issue</a> with his player’s foray into politics. Which is interesting because, when they lean to the left, athletes are often criticized for getting political. Indeed, the very same Laura Ingraham who is so thrilled about Butker’s move into politics memorably told the basketball star LeBron James to keep his political comments to himself and “shut up and dribble” back in 2018. Ingraham had taken umbrage at James discussing the challenges of being Black and a public figure in the US during an ESPN interview. “It’s always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid $100 million a year to bounce a ball,” <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/19/587097707/laura-ingraham-told-lebron-james-to-shutup-and-dribble-he-went-to-the-hoop">she snarked.</a></p> <p>Butker, meanwhile, gets paid $6.4m a year to play with a football. And I haven’t heard a single person on the right tell him to keep quiet and kick.</p>
