<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>Peter Dutton’s poll woes today comes as Victoria’s opposition leader, Brad Battin (pictured), distanced the state party from the opposition’s controversial nuclear policy, saying he will concentrate on gas and that the federal leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/15/victorian-liberal-leader-brad-battin-distances-state-party-from-peter-dutton-nuclear-proposal">has his “own campaign”</a>. In a wide-ranging interview with our state correspondent Benita Kolovos, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/14/brad-battin-is-counting-the-days-to-victoria-election-but-will-liberal-leader-pass-pub-test">Battin explains</a> how he would fix the justice system, why he “grew up differently” to fellow former cop Dutton and that he’s counting the days to the state’s next election (599 to go).</p> 
<h2>Not the news</h2> 
<p>It seems unlikely that the work of a 96-year-old Japanese artist could be the most popular exhibition in Australian history, topping even Van Gogh for visitor numbers. But Yayoi Kusama’s show at the NGV, with its bright colours, polka dots and flowers, has done just that – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/apr/15/yayoi-kusama-why-this-96-year-old-artists-show-is-the-most-popular-in-australian-history">prompting our own Sian Cain to find out why</a>.</p>
