<p>Making the point that women have always been especially vulnerable to popular prejudice and state victimisation, Lucy Mangan writes “there have never been … mass trials of … impoverished men who can be accused of supernatural crimes and put to death without evidence” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/14/witches-of-essex-review-rylan-real-life-witch-trials">Witches of Essex review, 14 October</a>).</p> <p>Well, maybe not. But much more recently than the witchcraft trials, six agricultural labourers from <a href="https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Tolpuddle-Martyrs/">Tolpuddle</a>, who came together in 1833 to form a society to fight for better wages, were prosecuted on the evidence of two informers who had witnessed the men swearing a solemn oath of mutual solidarity to the Friendly Association of Agricultural Labourers while standing blindfolded before a crude representation of a skeleton.</p> <p>The lurid imagery evoked by the account of the clandestine oath ceremony could hardly have failed to trigger thoughts of witchcraft and necromancy in the superstitious minds of a 19th-century Dorset jury and contribute to the guilty verdict and the men’s transportation to the penal settlements of Australia.
