<strong>Denmark has moved towards banning social media access to children under 15 in what it said was “a groundbreaking step” towards improving online safety.</strong></p>    <p>The government <a href="https://www.digmin.dk/digitalisering/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2025/nov/ny-politisk-aftale">said</a> that “<strong>the pressure from the tech giants’s business model is too significant,</strong> and the responsibility [for keeping children safe] must be therefore shouldered jointly” by parents and the state.</p> <p>The proposed measure <strong>provides a way for parents to agree to their child using social media earlier, from 13-year-old.</strong></p> <p>Minister <strong>Caroline Stage Olsen</strong> said the move was “a necessary stand against a situation where <strong>large tech platforms have had free rein in children’s rooms for far too long.</strong>”</p> <p>“The goal of the agreement is that 15 years of age becomes the norm in Denmark, so that <strong>children have more time for peace, play and development before they have profiles on social media,</strong> which are characterised by a number of risks,” the government said.</p> <p>The political agreement, announced today, also <strong>includes a push to strengthen the national regulator responsible for the implementation of the EU’s Digital Services Act.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div

regimes,</strong> according to a leaked paper.</p>    <p><strong>The European Commission intends the centre to bring together expertise across the EU</strong> and <a

manipulation and interference, and disinformation.</p> <p>The idea <strong>forms the centrepiece of the so-called “democracy shield”</strong>, pitched by commission president <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> when she sought a second term ahead of the European elections in 2024.</p> <p>Von der Leyen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/ursula-von-der-leyen-suspension-eu-trade-israel">announced the idea </a>of a European Centre for Democratic Resilience in <a

The document to be released on Wednesday outlines further details, including where the EU sees the biggest threat.</p> <p>The paper seen by the Guardian states: </p> <blockquote> <p><em>“In addition to its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine,<strong> Russia is also escalating hybrid attacks, waging a battle of influence against Europe.</strong> The tactics used are reaching deep into the fabric of our societies, with potentially long-lasting impacts. By spreading deceitful narratives, sometimes including the manipulation and falsification of historical facts, they try to erode trust in democratic systems.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The EU’s foreign service says <strong>it has identified dozens of instances of Russian disinformation and information manipulation,</strong> including through the <a href="https://euvsdisinfo.eu/doppelganger-strikes-back-unveiling-fimi-activities-targeting-european-parliament-elections/">Doppelganger campaign ahead of the European elections</a>, where copycat versions of well-known media sites promulgate anti-western narratives. </p> <p>Disinformation has been carried on websites mimicking media outlets such as <strong>Die Welt, Le Point, Le Parisien, La Stampa, La Repubblica, Polityka, </strong>and<strong> Polskie Radio.</strong> </p> <p>On these copycat sites, <strong>fake articles, which are also promoted on social media, sought to discredit political candidates or undermine government support for Ukrainian refugees</strong> or Ukraine.</p> <p><strong>The centre would be a hub for EU institutions and member states to share information,</strong> early warnings and raise public awareness about foreign governments seeking to manipulate information, especially during election campaigns and emergencies, such as a pandemic or power outage.</p> <p><strong>Participation in the centre would be voluntary for EU member states</strong> and countries hoping to join the EU. The commission also suggests participation could be open to “like-minded partners” raising the prospect of involvement for the UK, which is often described in such terms. </p> <p>Other elements of the democracy shield plan include t<strong>he creation of a network of independent European network of fact-checkers</strong>, and a voluntary network of internet influencers to raise awareness about EU rules on democratic standards.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-690dffca8f08236086ba5bfc" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/jennifer-rankin"> <p class="block-time

motives</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Andrew Roth </strong><em>in Washington and </em><strong>Flora Garamvolgyi</strong><em><strong> </strong>in Budapest</em></p> <p>In other news, <strong>Viktor Orbán will visit the White House on Friday as Hungary’s far-right prime minister tries to broker another summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin</strong> that his advisers claim could help end the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>    <p>Orbán, who has proposed hosting the summit in Budapest, <strong>will also seek an exemption from US sanctions against Russian energy</strong> in what will be a major test of Trump’s tougher line on the Kremlin after he accused Putin of slow-rolling negotiations to end the conflict.</p> <p>Yet <strong>Orbán’s priority, insiders say, is to get Trump to visit Hungary as he faces an unprecedented domestic challenge from a new opposition leader ahead</strong> of the parliamentary elections in April. A visit by Trump would reinforce Orbán’s role as a statesman and energise his conservative base, his advisers believe.</p> <p><strong>“Orbán wants Trump to come to Budapest before the elections,”</strong> said a source working for a Hungarian government foreign policy institution. “This is a top priority. They will discuss the Russian gas issue, but the thing Orbán cares about the most is the elections.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/07/orban-hungary-white-house-visit-trump">Orbán to visit US to try to broker another Putin summit but questions raised over motives</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-690db2538f08bdefda48515e" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/jakub-krupa"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-07T09:08:08.153Z">9.08am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Morning opening: Drones, once again</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Brussels and Liège airports in Belgium faced disruptions overnight once again over suspected drone sightings,</strong> just hours after the Belgian government’s national security council discussed its response to the emerging threats.</p>    <p>Both airports reported <strong>limited effect on their operations.</strong></p> <p>More <strong>unconfirmed drone sightings were also reported</strong> in the vicinity of the <strong>Doel nuclear power plant</strong> and the <strong>nuclear research center SCK in Mol</strong>, <a href="https://www.hln.be/nieuws/opnieuw-sprake-van-drones-in-buurt-van-brussels-airport-ook-meldingen-bij-nucleair-onderzoekscentrum-in-mol~a33d096f7/">as reported by Het Laatste Nieuws</a>, and <strong>Antwerp port</strong>, <a href="https://vrtnws.be/p.Pqn1MwxDy">as per VRT.</a></p> <p>Amid growing frustration with the continuing problem, Belgium is <strong>expected to receive anti-drone support from the German army</strong>, local media <a href="https://www.standaard.be/politiek/duitse-bundeswehr-komt-defensie-helpen-in-strijd-tegen-drones/103256542.html">reported</a>, in a bid to put an end to the repeated incidents of drone sightings near civil airports and military bases.</p> <p>Separately, <strong>Sweden’s second-largest airport in Gothenburg also reported drone disruptions,</strong> prompting police to open an investigation into “suspected aviation sabotage.”</p>    <p>The incidents come as <strong>a top German military official issued a stark warning that Russia would have capacity for a limited strike against Nato territory at any time</strong>, Reuters reported.</p> <p>“If you look at Russia’s current capabilities and combat power, Russia could kick off a small-scale attack against Nato territory as early as tomorrow,” Lt Gen <strong>Alexander Sollfrank</strong> told Reuters in an interview. “<strong>Small, quick, regionally limited, nothing big</strong> – Russia is too tied down in Ukraine for that.“</p> <p>Sollfrank said <strong>whether Moscow might choose to attack Nato would be determined by three factors:</strong> Russia’s military strength, military track record and leadership, Reuters reported.</p> <p>“These three factors lead me to the conclusion that a Russian attack is in the realm of the possible. <strong>Whether it will happen or not depends to a large extent on our own behaviour,</strong>” he added, alluding to Nato’s deterrence efforts.</p> <p>Let’s see what reactions we are going to get to these latest incidents.</p> <p>It’s <strong>Friday, 7 November 2025,</strong> it’s <strong>Jakub Krupa</strong> here, and this is <strong>Europe Live.</strong></p> <p><strong>Good morning.</strong></p> </div>   </div>
