<p>A federal judge has thrown out Drake’s defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG), ruling that the company cannot be held responsible for promoting Kendrick Lamar’s hit diss track Not Like Us.</p> <p>US district judge Jeannette Vargas decided Thursday that the song’s lyrics express “non-actionable opinion” and therefore cannot be considered defamatory.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/feb/11/silence-is-key-after-kendrick-lamars-super-bowl-how-can-drake-possibly-come-back">‘Silence is key’: after Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl, how can Drake possibly come back?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The issue in this case is whether Not Like Us can reasonably be understood to convey as a factual matter that Drake is a pedophile or that he has engaged in sexual relations with minors,” the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.635046/gov.uscourts.nysd.635046.96.0.pdf">judgment</a> states. “In light of the overall context in which the statements in the recording were made, the court holds that it cannot.”</p> <p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/drakes-not-like-us-defamation-suit-universal-music-group-dismissed-1236544861/">Variety</a>, a UMG spokesperson said: “From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day. We’re pleased with the court’s dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake’s music and investing in his career.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Drake said in a statement: “We intend to appeal today’s ruling, and we look forward to the court of appeals reviewing it.”</p> <p>Drake, who is signed to Republic Records, and Lamar, signed to Interscope Records, both operate under the Universal Music Group umbrella but through separate labels. The legal fight began earlier this year when Drake accused UMG of damaging his reputation by distributing and promoting Not Like Us.</p> <p>He claimed the company made secret payments and offered discounted licensing deals to boost the song’s reach, allegedly to harm his brand and reduce his leverage in ongoing contract talks.</p> <p>In March, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/mar/18/drake-kendrick-lamar-universal-lawsuit-dismissal-motion-ntwnfb">UMG filed</a> to have the motion dismissed. The label claimed that Drake “lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated”.</p> <p>“Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds,” UMG said in its statement. “Plaintiff’s complaint is utterly without merit and should be dismissed with prejudice.”</p> <p>Kendrick Lamar is widely acknowledged to have won last year’s culture-consuming rap beef with Drake, with Not Like Us going on to win five Grammy awards, including record of the year and song of the year.</p>
