For updates on Ukraine, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">follow here</a>.</p> <p>Here’s a wrap-up of the day’s key events:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a>, said on Monday he would be ready to join Russia’s Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/20/zelenskyy-calls-for-more-us-patriot-air-defences-after-trump-again-sides-with-putin">at their summit in Hungary if he is invited</a></strong>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/zelenskyy-tomahawk-missiles-trump-putin-budapest">Trump and Putin are expected to meet</a> in the Hungarian capital, possibly in a matter of weeks, as the US leader continues to try to broker a peace deal to end the three-and-a-half-year war. Zelenskyy told reporters in remarks released on Monday: “<em>If I am invited to Budapest – if it is an invitation in a format where we meet as three or, as it’s called, shuttle diplomacy, President Trump meets with Putin and President Trump meets with me – then in one format or another, we will agree.”</em></p></li> <li><p><strong>EU countries on Monday agreed to phase out remaining gas imports from Russia by January 2028,</strong> breaking a dependency the bloc has struggled to end despite Moscow’s war on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>. Energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg approved a plan by the European Commission to phase out both pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a>, subject to approval by the bloc’s parliament. The ministers approved the plans, which would phase out new Russian gas import contracts from January 2026, existing short-term contracts from June 2026, and long-term contracts in January 2028, at a meeting in Luxembourg. The law is not yet final. EU countries must negotiate the final rules with the European parliament, which is still debating its position.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump on Sunday suggested the best way to end the war in Ukraine would be to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/20/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-donbas-region-end-russia-invasion">“cut up” the Donbas region</a>,</strong> leaving most of it to Russia. The US president told reporters: “Let it be cut the way it is,” adding: “They can negotiate something later on down the line.” The comments came after a tense White House meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump reportedly put pressure on the Ukrainian president to give up swaths of territory.</p></li> <li><p><strong>EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was wrong to pressure Ukraine to secure an end to Russia’s war, after reports US president Donald Trump pushed Kyiv to give up land.</strong> Kallas said:<strong> </strong><em>“What we must not forget is that Russia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim here, so putting the pressure on Ukraine as the victim is not the right approach.” </em>Earlier on Monday, Kallas said that it was “not nice” that Putin might travel to EU member Hungary for talks on the war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his reportedly tense meeting with Donald Trump on Friday was “positive” — even though he did not secure the Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine. </strong>Zelenskyy said Trump reneged on the possibility of sending the long-range missiles to Ukraine, which would have been a major boost for Kyiv, after his phone call with Vladimir Putin hours earlier.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine is preparing a contract to buy 25 Patriot air defence systems.</strong> In comments to media at a meeting on Sunday and cleared for use on Monday, Zelenskyy said the systems would be supplied every year for a number of years, and that Ukraine would seek for some European nations to give Kyiv priority in the queue for the systems. Patriots are seen by Kyiv as the most effective systems to stop Russian ballistic missiles, which travel several times faster than the speed of sound.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy said he had spoken to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday about applying pressure on Russia</strong>, and that he had agreed to meet him in the near future. “Pressuring the one who started the war is the key to a denouement,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “Emmanuel and I discussed all the current diplomatic aspects and our recent contacts with partners.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia is prepared to expand cooperation with Iran in all areas</strong>. Asked by reporters how Russia saw the development of events around Iran’s nuclear programme and if Moscow would deepen ties with Tehran, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: <em>“Russia is definitely ready to expand cooperation with Iran in all areas. Iran is our partner, and our relations are developing very dynamically.”</em></p></li> <li><p><strong>The European Union is looking to increase the ability of its member states to carry out inspections on Russia’s “shadow fleet”</strong> of ageing oil tankers. <em>“We are discussing with the member states how to better coordinate our actions regarding the shadow fleet,”</em> EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas said at a meeting with foreign ministers. <em>“We should think about it more – to be more creative.”</em></p></li> <li><p><strong>Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto will visit Washington on Tuesday.</strong> Szijjarto did not say whom he would meet in Washington after arriving on Tuesday or what the agenda of the US visit was.</p></li> <li><p><strong>An investigation into the Lisbon funicular crash will publish its first report on Monday into the causes of the derailment,</strong> which killed 16 people in early September.</p></li> <li><p><strong>France’s Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted Monday to security flaws in protecting the Louvre that had led to robbers a day earlier stealing imperial jewels in broad daylight from the famed Paris museum. </strong><em>“What is certain is that we have failed, since people were able to park a furniture hoist in the middle of Paris, get people up it in several minutes to grab priceless jewels and give France a terrible image,”</em> he told France Inter radio. The Louvre remained closed on Monday for a second day running.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Louvre did not tap a private Israeli intel firm despite the CEO’s earlier claims that they had.</strong> “The Louvre exceptionally asked us to uncover the identity of people involved in the theft and to retrieve the stolen artefacts,” CGI Group CEO Zvika Naveh told AFP on Monday. However, shortly after, the management of the Louvre museum denied having contacted a private Israeli intel firm to investigate the weekend’s heist. A press representative told the Guardian in an email: <em>“The Musée du Louvre denies having contacted an Israeli company in connection with the investigation.”</em></p></li> <li><p><strong>Greece slammed as ‘provocative’ the British Museum first ever fundraiser that had guests dining in the gallery hosting the Parthenon marbles. </strong>“The safety, integrity, and ethics of the monuments should be the primary concern of the British Museum, which once again demonstrates provocative indifference,” Greece culture minister Lina Mendoni said in a statement.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Pope Leo met with survivors of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy for the first time on Monday,</strong> days after the Vatican’s child protection commission accused senior Church leaders of being too slow to help victims. Leo held a meeting with Ending Clergy Abuse, an international coalition of survivors, the group said. The encounter, which included six abuse victims, lasted about an hour and was “a significant moment of dialogue,” they said. The 1.4-billion-member Church has been shaken for decades by scandals across the world involving abuse and cover-up, damaging its credibility and costing it hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-20T14:13:42.641Z">at 3.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68f639eb8f089404e7e56609" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-20T14:01:08.106Z">3.01pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">EU chief: Pressuring Ukraine 'not right approach' to ending war</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>EU foreign policy chief <strong>Kaja Kallas</strong> said Monday it was wrong to pressure Ukraine to secure an end to Russia’s war, after reports US president Donald Trump pushed Kyiv to give up land.</p> <p>Kallas, after a meeting of EU foreign ministers, said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>What we must not forget is that Russia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim here, so putting the pressure on Ukraine as the victim is not the right approach.</p> </blockquote> <p>She added:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We are working also trying to convince our allies all across the world, nothing can come out of these meetings if Ukraine or Europe is not part of it.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Who doesn’t want to end this war is Russia.

The hall, full of gold leaf and paintings, would be the model for the Palace of Versailles’ Hall of Mirrors.</p> <p>For more details on the reaction to the robbery and whether this has happened before, read:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/20/louvre-museum-robbery-thieves-stolen-jewellery">Louvre museum robbery: how the thieves broke in, what they stole and what happens next</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-20T10:44:00.108Z">at 11.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68f605d48f089def4b073355" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-20T10:05:08.587Z">11.05am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Russia accuses Ukraine of contradictory signals on peace process</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Russia said on Monday it was engaged in serious work with the United States to seek a peace deal in Ukraine but accused Ukraine of sending contradictory signals that made the process harder.</p> <p>The Kremlin said that Budapest was chosen as the venue for a summit between Russian president <strong>Vladimir</strong> <strong>Putin</strong> and US president <strong>Donald</strong> <strong>Trump</strong> because Hungarian prime minister <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong> has warm ties with Trump and constructive ties with Putin.</p> <p>Kremlin spokesperson <strong>Dmitry Peskov</strong> told reporters that work was only just beginning on the summit, which would be aimed at advancing a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, and developing relations between Russia and the United States.</p> <p>He declined to give any further information about the most recent phone call between the two leaders last week.</p> <p>The Russian Defence Ministry also said on Monday that its troops had taken control of the village of Molodetske in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.
