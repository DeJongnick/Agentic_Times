<p>The Producers star Nathan Lane says that “homophobia is alive and well” in Hollywood and that being an out gay actor cost him roles.</p> <p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/nathan-lane-midcentury-modern-awards-insider">In an interview with Vanity Fair</a>, Lane said that his breakthrough film role in the 1996 comedy <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/article/20210310-the-birdcage-at-25-a-pioneering-moment-in-mainstream-cinema">The Birdcage</a>, in which he played a flamboyant drag queen in a long-term relationship with Robin Williams’ club-owner, failed to lead to a significant movie acting career, reporting that his then agent told him: “Maybe if you weren’t so open about your lifestyle, it would have.”</p> <p>Lane added: “I don’t know what goes on behind closed doors, but I can’t help but think that [homophobia] played a part.”</p> <p>As an example, Lane said he was up for a role in the part-animated basketball comedy Space Jam (also released in 1996) and said he was told “the director [Joe Pytka] saw me hosting the Tony awards and thought that suggested I was too gay to play the part”. In the end, Wayne Knight (who played Newman in Seinfeld) was cast in the film. “But I don’t know. I’ll never know what people say. Homophobia is alive and well still.”</p> <p>Lane added that his early career success in theatre may have reinforced homophobic attitudes towards him. “There’s always … that ‘He’s from the <em>theatre</em>’ thing. It’s either homophobia or it’s just, ‘He gives big performances because he comes from the <em>theatre</em>.’ If they give me a chance, I seem to do well – but you have to get the part. You need a part to prove that. I gave up long ago trying to pursue it.”</p> <p>Lane also said he was “grateful” to Ryan Murphy, whose advent allowed him to play major character roles in TV shows, including journalist Dominick Dunne in Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story and defence attorney F Lee Bailey in The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime Story. He added: “Before I die, it would be lovely to get to play a juicy, serious supporting role in some film.”</p>
