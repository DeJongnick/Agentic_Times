<p>We want to hear from people aged 60 or over who have set up their own business in the UK, why they became entrepreneurs later in life and, if applicable, their reasons for still working past retirement age. How long have you been running your business and in what areas are you working?</p> <p>What has it been like to set up your own shop in your 60s or 70s?</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="dc3fa4ae-6d50-49f8-b51f-641397e040da" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <h2><strong>This Community callout closed on 30 January 2025.</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>You can contribute to open Community callouts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-community-team">here</a> or Share a story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/sep/02/guardianwitness-send-us-a-story">here</a>.</strong></p></li> </ul>
