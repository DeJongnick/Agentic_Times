<h1>Hegseth falsely cited weapon shortages in halting shipments to Ukraine, Democrats say</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, the US defense secretary, unilaterally halted an agreed shipment of military aid to Ukraine due to baseless concerns that US stockpiles of weapons have run too low, it has been reported.</p> 
<p>A batch of air defense missiles and other precision munitions were due to be sent to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> to aid it in its ongoing war with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a>, which launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022. The aid was promised by the US during Joe Biden’s administration last year.</p> 
<p>But the Pentagon halted the shipment, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/hegseth-halted-weapons-ukraine-military-analysis-aid-wouldnt-jeopardiz-rcna216790">with NBC reporting</a> that a decision to do so was made solely by Hegseth, Donald Trump’s top defense official and a former Fox News weekend host who has previously come under pressure for sharing plans of a military strike in two group chats on the messaging app Signal, one of which accidentally included a journalist.</p>

<p>Hegseth has now halted US military supplies to Ukraine on three occasions, NBC said, with the latest intervention purportedly coming due to concerns that the US’s own weapons stockpile is running too low.</p> 
<p>When the president was <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1940883017787949217">asked about the pause</a> in shipments to Ukraine by a reporter on Thursday, he claimed that it was necessary because “Biden emptied out our whole country, giving them weapons, and we have to make sure we have enough for ourselves”.</p> 
<p>A White House spokesperson said last week that the decision “was made to put America’s interests first following a [defense department] review of our nation’s military support and assistance to other countries across the globe. The strength of the United States armed forces remains unquestioned – just ask Iran.”</p> 
<p>“This capability review,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/skGPskzRTOQ?si=6x2BYx37KHod3N9M&amp;t=1162">told reporters</a> on Wednesday, “is being conducted to ensure US military aid aligns with our defense priorities.”</p> 
<p>“We see this as a commonsense, pragmatic step towards having a framework to evaluate what munitions are sent and where,” Parnell added. He also seemed to confirm that there is no current shortage of arms for US forces. “Let it be known that our military has everything that it needs to conduct any mission, anywhere, anytime, all around the world,” he said.</p> 
<p>The decision surprised members of Congress, as well as Ukraine and the US’s European allies. Democrats said there is no evidence that American weapon stocks are in decline.</p> 
<p>“We are not at any lower point, stockpile-wise, than we’ve been in the three-and-a-half years of the Ukraine conflict,” Adam Smith, a Democrat and ranking member of the House armed services committee, told NBC. Smith said that his staff had “seen the numbers” on weapon supplies and that there is no justification to suspend aid to Ukraine.</p> 
<p>The weapons being delayed include dozens of Patriot interceptor missiles that can defend against Russian missile attacks, as well as howitzers and other missile systems.</p> 
<p>Russia has recently stepped up its bombardment of Ukrainian cities, using missiles and drones to wreak havoc and terror among Ukrainian civilians. The delay in getting help to fend off these attacks is “painful”, a senior Ukrainian lawmaker said last week.</p> 
<p>“This decision is certainly very unpleasant for us,” said Fedir Venislavskyi, a member of the Ukrainian parliament’s defense committee, according to Reuters.</p> 
<p>“It’s painful, and against the background of the terrorist attacks which Russia commits against Ukraine.”</p> 
<p>The Department of Defense did not reply to a request for comment on the aid pause. </p>
