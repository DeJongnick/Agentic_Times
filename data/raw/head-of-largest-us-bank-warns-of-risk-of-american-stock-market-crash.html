<p>The chance of the US stock market crashing is far greater than many financiers believe, the head of America’s largest bank has said.</p> <p>Jamie Dimon, who is the chair and chief executive of the giant Wall Street bank JPMorgan Chase, said he was “far more worried than others” about a serious market correction, which he predicted could come in the next six months to two years.</p> <p>“I would give it a higher probability than I think is probably priced in the market and by others,” he <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg5ej03p604o">told the BBC</a>. “So if the market’s pricing in 10%, I would say it is more like 30%.”</p> <p>Dimon added there were a “lot of things out there” creating an atmosphere of uncertainty, pointing to risks including the geopolitical environment, fiscal spending and the remilitarisation of the world.</p> <p>“All these things cause a lot of issues that we don’t know how to answer,” he said. “So I say the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people’s minds than what I would call normal.”</p> <p>The comments are the latest in a string of warnings that stock markets may be due a correction.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said the world economy had shown surprising resilience in the face of Donald Trump’s trade war, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/08/imf-chief-warns-uncertainty-is-the-new-normal-in-global-economy">issued a stark warning about the mounting risks</a>, saying: “Buckle up: uncertainty is the new normal.”</p> <p>“Before anyone heaves a big sigh of relief, please hear this: global resilience has not yet been fully tested. And there are worrying signs the test may come,” she told an audience at the Milken Institute in Washington.</p> <p>Meanwhile, concerns are increasingly being aired that a stock market bubble has been created by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/oct/08/the-ai-valuation-bubble-is-now-getting-silly">high valuations of AI companies</a>, with the Bank of England stating on Wednesday that there is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/08/bank-of-england-warns-of-growing-risk-that-ai-bubble-could-burst">growing risk of a “sudden correction” in global markets</a>.</p> <p>Dimon conceded that some of the money being invested in AI would “probably be lost”.</p> <p>He added: “The way I look at it is AI is real; AI in total will pay off – just like cars in total paid off, and TVs in total paid off, but most people involved in them didn’t do well.”</p>
