<p>Morning everyone. The unity of the Coalition – and its climate policy – will be in the spotlight again today after Andrew Hastie said last night that he would quit the frontbench team if Sussan Ley sticks to her policy of backing net zero emissions.</p> 
<p>Kim Beazley has defended the Australian War Memorial’s decision to exclude a book about Ben Roberts-Smith from its literary prize; a scam weight-loss drug has been exposed as just watery saline solution; Gulf states are pleading with Donald Trump to rein in Israel; and pole vaulter Kurtis Marschall has opened Australia’s account in Tokyo.</p>
