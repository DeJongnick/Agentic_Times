<p>On Monday, Donald Trump took aim at a “ridiculous situation” that directly affects his daily life: paper straws.</p> <p>He signed an executive order that rolls back a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.</p> <p>“It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,” Trump told reporters at the White House as he signed the order. “These things don’t work,” he said, referring to paper straws. “I’ve had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode.”</p> <p>But Trump, such a fan of drinking Diet Coke that he has installed a <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/trump-diet-coke-button-oval-office">button</a> in the Oval Office in order to summon staff to deliver the drink, has long railed against any restrictions upon plastic straws. When attempting to gain re-election in 2020, his campaign <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/19/743683131/trump-seizes-on-soggy-paper-straws-as-campaign-issue-make-straws-great-again">sold</a> reusable straws on its website claiming that “liberal paper straws don’t work”.</p>    <p>While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said on Monday that he thought “it’s OK” to continue using them. “I don’t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they’re … munching their way through the ocean,” he said at a White House announcement.</p> <p>The White House staff secretary, Will Scharf, who presented the executive order to Trump, told him the push for paper straws had cost the government and private industry “an absolute ton of money and left consumers all over the country wildly dissatisfied with their straws”.</p> <p>The order directs federal agencies to review procurement processes to allow use of plastic straws. “It really is something that affects ordinary Americans in their everyday lives,” Scharf said.</p> <p>The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump’s move.</p> <p>“Straws are just the beginning,” Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. “‘Back to Plastic’ is a movement we should all get behind.”</p> <p>The world is undergoing a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/20/five-firms-in-plastic-pollution-alliance-made-1000-times-more-waste-than-they-saved-analysis-shows">glut of new plastic production</a>, and a summit among countries last year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/01/international-talks-on-curbing-plastic-pollution-fail-to-reach-agreement-busan">failed to come to a deal</a> to address this despite growing recognition of the harm caused by waste that takes hundreds of years to break down. Global annual plastic production doubled in the two decades since 2000 to about 460m tonnes and is expected to quadruple again by 2050.</p>    <p>Less than 10% of this plastic waste is <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/global-plastics-outlook_de747aef-en.html">now being recycled</a>. The rest invariably ends up in the environment, with the equivalent of one truck filled with plastic dumping its contents into the ocean every minute, according to experts’ estimates. Much of this trash is composed of single-use plastics, such as straws, which make up <a href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/guides/singleuseplastics/healthimpacts">about</a> 40% of plastic production.</p> <p>The result of this boom has been a world riddled with plastics, with large or microscopic fragments of the material found in every corner of the planet, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/21/no-mountain-high-enough-study-finds-plastic-in-clean-air">even in the air</a>. Plastics choke and throttle marine creatures and birds and microplastics have been found deep within the bodies of animals, including humans. Research has found plastics present in people’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/03/levels-of-microplastics-in-human-brains-may-be-rapidly-rising-study-suggests">brains</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/20/microplastics-human-testicles-study-sperm-counts">testicles</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time">blood</a> and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/27/microplastics-found-every-human-placenta-tested-study-health-impact">placentas</a>.</p> <p>More than 390m straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to the advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network. Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, says the group.</p> <p>“To prevent another sea turtle from becoming a victim to plastic, we must make personal lifestyle alterations to fight for these species,’’ the group said in a statement.</p> <p><em>Oliver Milman contributed to this report</em></p>
