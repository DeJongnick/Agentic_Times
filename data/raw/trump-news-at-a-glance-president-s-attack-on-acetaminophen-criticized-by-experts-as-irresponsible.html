<p>Donald Trump announced on Monday that pregnant women should limit their use of acetaminophen, usually branded as Tylenol in the US or paracetamol elsewhere, which he claimed heightens the risk of autism when it used by pregnant women, an assertion hotly contested by scientists internationally and contradicted by studies.</p> <p>The president said he had “waited for 20 years for this meeting” and added: “It’s not that everything’s 100% understood or known, but I think we’ve made a lot of strides.”</p> <p>Experts immediately criticized the announcement. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the leading US organization for obstetricians and gynecologists, said Trump’s announcement was “irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients”.</p> <p>“Today’s announcement … is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,” the organization’s president, Dr Steven Fleischman, said in a statement.</p>  <h2>Trump attacks use of key painkiller in contentious announcement</h2>  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> unveiled highly contentious conclusions about the causes of autism, together with a push for research purporting to find a possible “cure” for the condition on Monday. </p> <p>Trump said pregnant women should <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/">limit their use of acetaminophen</a>, known as Tylenol in the US and paracetamol elsewhere, claiming it heightens the risk of autism when used by pregnant women, flying in the face of broad medical consensus.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/trump-administration-autism-causes"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel to be back on TV on Tuesday, Disney announces</h2>  <p>Disney announced on Monday that Jimmy Kimmel Live! would return to broadcast this Tuesday, after a brief but highly criticized <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/18/jimmy-kimmel-live-suspended-indefinitely-after-hosts-charlie-kirk-comments">suspension</a> that sparked a national debate on free speech and the muzzling tactics of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/22/jimmy-kimmel-show-return-charlie-kirk-suspension-disney"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump designates antifa a ‘domestic terror organization’ after Charlie Kirk killing</h2>  <p>Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday that designates antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization”, reviving a controversial pledge from his first presidency in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s killing on 10 September and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/charlie-kirk-memorial-arizona-dispatch">yesterday’s memorial service</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-backlash-social-media-king"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Democrats urge Trump border czar investigation over $50,000 bag of cash claims</h2>  <p>Democrats have urged treasury watchdogs to investigate <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/tom-homan-cash-contracts-trump-doj-investigation-rcna232568">reports</a> that Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan accepted a $50,000 bag of cash from an undercover FBI agent in return for political favors.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-backlash-social-media-king"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Democrats silent as Republicans galvanized by Kirk memorial</h2>  <p>Democrats maintained a wary silence on Monday as Donald Trump’s Republican party appeared galvanized by a memorial service for the late rightwing activist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/thousands-gather-at-charlie-kirk-memorial-in-arizona-where-trump-to-pay-tribute-to-slain-organizer">Charlie Kirk</a> that was part religious revival, part political rally.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-backlash-social-media-king"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Explainer: how the H-1B visa changes work and could affect you</h2>  <p>Donald Trump’s administration has announced an annual $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, a type of US visa that allows companies to hire foreign workers in skilled occupations such as IT, healthcare and engineering.
