<p>The battle to lead the Greens has been confirmed as a straight fight between a joint ticket comprising two of the party’s MPs, Adrian Ramsay and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/17/green-party-british-politics-leader-adrian-ramsay-ellie-chowns">Ellie Chowns</a>, and the more insurgent offering of Zack Polanski, the deputy leader.</p> <p>A final list of nominations to head the party in England and Wales has resulted in a two-way battle for the leadership, while nine candidates are vying to be deputy leader.</p> <p>Since 2021 the party has been led by Ramsay and Carla Denyer, two of the Greens’ record haul of four MPs elected to Westminster a year ago. In May, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/08/carla-denyer-says-she-will-not-stand-again-as-greens-co-leader-to-focus-on-mp-role">Denyer announced she would not stand again</a>, with Ramsay opting to stand again alongside Chowns.</p>    <p>The leadership race is broadly a competition between two contrasting styles: the more organised and elections-led approach <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/12/adrian-ramsay-stand-re-election-greens-co-leader-with-ellie-chowns">of the two MPs</a>, versus Polanski’s aim to make the Greens a radical, mass-membership “eco-populism” movement.</p> <p>Polanski, who has been deputy leader since 2022 and serves as a London assembly member, said the party had to meet the challenge of Reform UK, which has a membership about four times the size of the Green party and won nearly 700 councillors in May’s local elections, against 79 for the Greens.</p> <p>Ramsay and Chowns have dismissed this implicit criticism, saying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/05/uk-general-election-2024-surprise-winners-and-losers-corbyn-truss">their record in winning</a> rural, Conservative-dominated seats a year ago – Chowns won North Herefordshire from the Tories while Ramsay took the new seat of Waveney Valley on the Norfolk-Suffolk border – showed they could win over new supporters.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/17/green-party-purge-gender-critical-voices-expelled-former-spokesperson-pallavi-devulapalli">Green party trying to purge gender-critical voices, claims expelled former spokesperson </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Greens in England and Wales normally hold leadership elections every two years, but there has not been a vote since 2021. Denyer and Ramsay were initially elected for three years, as their election was out of sequence after Siân Berry, now the fourth of the party’s MPs, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jul/14/sian-berry-quits-as-green-party-leader-in-dispute-over-trans-rights">quit</a> a year after a vote. The contest was then postponed for another year because of the general election.</p> <p>Voting by party members for the posts of leader and deputy leader opens on 1 August and runs for the whole month, with results announced on 2 September.</p> <p>Denyer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/08/carla-denyer-says-she-will-not-stand-again-as-greens-co-leader-to-focus-on-mp-role">decided not to run again for</a> the leadership of the party, saying she wanted to focus on her Bristol Central constituency and campaigns such as net zero and affordable housing.</p> <p>The <a href="https://greenparty.org.uk/members/internal-elections/2025-internal-elections/deputy-leader/">candidates for the deputy leadership</a> include a number of councillors but are largely unknown outside the party. The hopeful with the highest profile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/09/mothin-ali-challenges-greens-middle-class-image-as-he-enters-deputy-race">is Mothin Ali</a>, a Leeds councillor who intervened to stop rioters last summer and has received <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/23/mothin-ali-riots-leeds-green-party-councillor-gipton-and-harehills">death threats for his vocal support for Gaza</a>.</p>
