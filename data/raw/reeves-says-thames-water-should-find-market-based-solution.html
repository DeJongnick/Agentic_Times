<p>Rachel Reeves has told investors she would like to see a “market-based solution” for problems at Thames Water, rather than placing the company into special administration.</p> <p>The chancellor sent a letter in July to the Thames Water creditor group, which represents about 100 financial institutions that are trying to create a rescue plan for the company.</p> <p>Reeves sent the letter after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/19/thames-water-renationalisation-preparations">comments from the environment secretary, Steve Reed</a>, in June. He told MPs the government had “stepped up our preparations and stand ready for all eventualities … including [a] special administration regime if that were to become necessary”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/27/thames-water-agrees-payment-plan-for-sewage-and-dividend-fines">Thames Water agrees payment plan for £123m sewage and dividend fines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The remarks are reported to have caused concern among some debt-holders in the water industry, as such steps would involve a temporary form of nationalisation, leading to the restructuring of its £17.7bn net debt and the possible sale of the company to new owners.</p> <p>In the letter, seen by the Times, Reeves wrote: “The government recognises the seriousness of the situation facing Thames Water … Our position remains that the company should find a sustainable, market-based solution to the current situation.</p> <p>“This solution must not only secure the company’s long-term financial stability but also deliver a successful turnaround that achieves positive outcomes for customers and the environment.”</p> <p>However, she echoed Reed’s earlier remarks, writing: “The government is prepared for all eventualities across its regulated industries and has undertaken detailed contingency planning for a special administration regime, should this be required to ensure the continued provision of vital public services.”</p> <p>Thames Water has been under the effective control of its senior creditors, which hold most of its debt pile since shareholders walked away from the company last year.</p> <p>The water company, which serves 16 million customers across London and the south-east, has been on the verge of financial collapse for several years, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/11/debt-sewage-and-dividends-the-rising-tide-of-thames-waters-troubles">decades of underinvestment and dividend extraction</a>.</p> <p>Thames has desperately been seeking a way out of the turmoil without the government being forced to take control under a special administration regime, which is essentially temporary nationalisation. Last month it emerged the government had engaged the advisory firm FTI Consulting to look at its options, including special administration.</p> <p>The government is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/18/ofwat-to-be-abolished-as-ministers-explore-creating-new-water-regulator">planning to abolish Ofwat</a>, which could result in further complications as rival water companies might also consider legal action if Thames secures a favourable deal not available to them.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “The government will always act in the national interest on these issues.</p> <p>“The company remains financially stable, but we have stepped up our preparations and stand ready for all eventualities, including applying for a special administration regime if that were to become necessary.”</p>
