<p>The government is urging people who qualify for the warm home discount to check they are named on their energy bills so that this winter’s price cut can be made automatically.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/the-warm-home-discount-scheme">The annual scheme</a> gives households on low incomes £150 off their electricity bill, and is applied by the energy companies rather than sent out to customers. To qualify, you or your partner need to receive one of a list of benefits. These include housing benefit, income-based jobseeker’s allowance and pension credit.</p> <p>To get the discount, you also need your, or your partner’s, name to be on the bill.</p> <p>In England and Wales, the energy companies will automatically match people’s eligibility using their customer records from 24 August. In Scotland, the discount will automatically go to people who get pension credit guarantee and are named on their electricity bill. They will need to apply to their provider from October if on other qualifying benefits.</p> <p>It is not too late to get the discount after next Sunday, but you will need to wait for a letter to&nbsp;apply.</p> <p>Eligible customers on prepayment meters, who use a key or card to top up, should also ensure their household’s account is registered in their name.</p> <p>The government has expanded eligibility to the warm home discount this year, and it says that, as a result, 6 million households will receive the discount this winter&nbsp;– an increase of 2.7 million on last year.</p> <p>The minister for energy consumers Miatta Fahnbulleh, says:<strong> </strong>“If you know someone who might be eligible, please start spreading the word to family and friends, encouraging them to check&nbsp;they are named on their energy bill.”</p>    <p>Richard Neudegg, the director of regulation at the price comparison website Uswitch, says the discount could be “a lifeline for vulnerable customers”. He adds: “Anyone struggling to pay their bills should contact their supplier, who may be able to offer help or support.”</p> <p>This year the government has also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/04/winter-fuel-payments-to-be-reinstated-this-year-rachel-reeves-confirms">reversed the move</a> that took the winter fuel payment from all but the poorest pensioners. As a result, about nine million pensioners will get the allowance of up to £300, which will be paid to everyone who receives the state pension. Those with an income of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/09/winter-fuel-payment-change-explained">£35,000 or more will have theirs clawed back through tax</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jul/27/scam-watch-winter-fuel-allowance-u-turn-news-scammers">Scammers have been taking advantage of confusion over the payments</a> to target vulnerable people. Fraudulent messages are sent to people saying they need to register for this year’s “winter heating allowance”, and asking them to follow a link and submit personal details.</p> <p>The Department for Work and Pensions says it never texts people to ask for their information.</p> <p>The energy price cap is likely to change at the start of October, with analysts recently predicting that it will fall from its<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/may/23/energy-bills-in-great-britain-to-fall-ofgem-price-cap"> current level of £1,720 a year for a typical household</a>.</p>
