<p>Having rambled for 65 years with Ordnance Survey maps and a compass, I agree with John Harris about using GPS in the wild (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/27/smartphone-apps-gps-mountain-rescues-rise">We now leave navigation to our phones. The result: more of us are getting hopelessly lost, 27 April</a>). A phone screen is too small to see the wider terrain. But having carried an emergency whistle and pocket heliograph, I have to admit that phones can be a&nbsp;lifesaver in a real emergency.<br><strong>Joe Oldaker</strong><br><em>Nuneaton, Warwickshire</em></p> <p>• I can’t be the only one to think that if you can afford to quaff champagne on a regular basis, that would tend to lead to a more positive outlook and greater life chances generally (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/29/drink-champagne-reduce-risk-sudden-cardiac-arrest-study-suggests">Drinking champagne could reduce risk of sudden cardiac arrest, study suggests, 29 April</a>).<br><strong>Deirdre Burrell</strong><br><em>Mortimer, Berkshire</em></p> <p>• I always use self-checkouts (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/28/self-service-tills-a-bleeping-pain-or-brilliant">Letters, 28 April</a>). They often don’t work, which provides an opportunity to chat to other customers while we wait for an assistant to sort things out. In my local food store this provides employment for at least two people.<br><strong>David Diprose</strong><br><em>Thame, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>• One response to “How can I&nbsp;digitally help you?” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/27/ruffling-feathers-on-the-allotment">Letters, 27 April</a>) could be: “Well, you could pull your finger out for a start.”<br><strong>Dr Jonathan J Ross</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>• Further to the letters from Ian Saville (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/25/a-good-nights-sleep-for-heathrow-boss">25 March</a>) and Malcolm Shifrin (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/27/a-way-for-politicians-to-share-out-the-freebies">27 March</a>), pointing out your failure to acknowledge in your Birthdays column their unique contributions to life on Earth, please publish this letter in your print edition on 30 April to wish them both a very&nbsp;happy birthday from me.<br><strong>Jenny Swann</strong><br><em>Beeston, Nottingham</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
