<p>The first farmer-led programme to vaccinate badgers against tuberculosis is beginning in Cornwall with an aim to prevent transmission of the disease to cattle.</p> <p>The programme is significant because farmers and scientists have long been at loggerheads over the culling of badgers as a way to control TB. The three-year trial will start with 70 farms and involve farmers trapping, testing and vaccinating badgers, with training provided by scientists. An earlier pilot study of the approach showed TB rates in <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10691">badgers fell from 16% to zero</a> in four years.</p> <p>TB can devastate cattle herds and more than <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/incidence-of-tuberculosis-tb-in-cattle-in-great-britain/quarterly-tb-in-cattle-in-great-britain-statistics-notice-march-2025">20,000 infected cattle</a> were slaughtered in the last year in England. The badger cull started in 2013 and has <a href="https://www.badgertrust.org.uk/post/over-half-of-uk-badger-population-killed-247-880-culled-since-2013">killed about 250,000 badgers</a> but has been highly controversial.</p> <p>Most scientists have argued since the start that culling can make no meaningful contribution to TB control in cattle, based on a large-scale trial from 1998 to 2005. They say most cattle are infected by other cattle and that controlling livestock movements are key. Most farmers argue that badgers are a dangerous reservoir for the disease and must be controlled. The results of the culling to date are contested. Badger culling is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/30/badger-culling-end-england-2029-government-says">due to end in 2029</a>.</p>    <p>The £1.4m project is the first time the National Farmers’ Union has led a badger vaccination programme. Previous badger vaccination trials have been conducted by wildlife groups.</p> <p>Prof Rosie Woodroffe, at the Institute of Zoology in London, said: “For half a century, wildlife advocates and farmers have argued about the best way to manage the risk of TB transmission between badgers and cattle. Ultimately, we all want the same thing: to see TB eliminated so that farmers, their livestock, and wildlife can all thrive.</p> <p>“By working together to compare different approaches, we can develop a shared understanding of the evidence and use it to identify TB control solutions which are effective and sustainable.”</p> <p>Bridget Whell, a farmer and the NFU’s Cornwall chair, is taking part in the project and has 1,200 cattle serving two dairies. She has lost half the cattle from one of the dairies in the past and her farm has spent most of the last 15 years under government restrictions due to TB infections. “It was really devastating,” she said.</p> <p>There have been six years of badger culling on Whell’s farm but that have now ended due to the government’s decision to end culling. “It does seem now that in terms of the tools available, aside from biosecurity and [cattle] testing, [badger vaccination] is the future,” she said. Cattle vaccines for TB are being developed but have been complicated by the need to be able to distinguish between infected and vaccinated animals when they are tested.</p>    <p>“There’s been a lack of confidence [about badger vaccination] because there’s been no information,” Whell said. “What we hope to ultimately get out of [the project] is whether [badger vaccination] affects the cattle levels of TB – that remains to be seen, but I think it’s well worth doing.”</p> <p>“My scepticism, if any, is whether this is as a policy is sustainable, financially and practically.”</p> <p>The project will begin with 70 farmers over 80 sq km<sup> </sup> in Cornwall, and expand over three years to cover 400 to 500 sq km. It will assess the impact of badger vaccination on TB control and examine how vaccination can be scaled up and delivered in the most cost-efficient way.</p> <p>The project will assess three vaccination approaches to determine which works best: annual vaccination over four years, vaccination every other year or reactive vaccination based on TB infection on farms.</p>
