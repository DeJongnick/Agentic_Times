<p>Ever get the feeling of deja vu? In Indore on Wednesday, Australia took up where they had left off at the MCG in January: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/30/australia-england-womens-ashes-cricket-test-day-one-report">Alana King bowled unplayable balls</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/31/australia-england-womens-ashes-test-cricket-day-two-report">Annabel Sutherland</a> and Ash Gardner piled on the runs, and one side left the other for dust. It is the World Cup instead of the Ashes, but the result – a six-wicket win for Australia, with 57 balls to spare – was horribly familiar.</p> <p>Sutherland’s contribution to this World Cup had been limited to merely being the leading wicket-taker. On Wednesday, she again showcased her variations, getting a hint of away movement to clip the top of Amy Jones’s off stump, before removing Tammy Beaumont and Emma Lamb with her slower ball. Her three for 60, and a 10-over spell from King that went for 20, ensured that England put just 244 on the board.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/oct/22/australia-v-england-womens-cricket-world-cup-live">Australia beat England by six wickets at Women’s Cricket World Cup – live reaction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>England saw a glimmer of hope after Australia wobbled to 68 for four, with Linsey Smith again making inroads in the powerplay. But Sutherland, who had failed to reach double figures in four previous matches, snatched that hope away. Her unbeaten 98 was bettered only by the supremely powerful ball‑striking of Gardner, who took 22 balls to transform her half-century into a ton.</p> <p>Such was Australia’s dominance that Gardner, having brought up her century with four runs needed for the win, defended three balls from Lauren Bell to try to enable Sutherland to reach her own three‑figures. But Sutherland chose to run a single, allowing Gardner to strike the winning boundary. “I was happy for Ash to get it done,” Sutherland told Sky Sports.</p> <p>Both teams have already qualified for the semi-finals, but Australia are in pole position to top the group, assuming they defeat South Africa on Saturday. England will play the loser of that game, regardless of the result in their final group-stage match against New Zealand on Sunday.</p>    <p>“We took a few wickets at the start and put them under the pump, but they came back with a brilliant partnership to win the game,” Nat Sciver-Brunt said. “In patches we created opportunities and a bit of pressure, but we couldn’t prolong it. Australia bat very deep.”</p> <p>This was England’s first defeat, but the theme of their campaign came back to haunt them: a weak middle. This time it spoke to a phase of play, rather than the batting lineup – they scored 26 runs between the 20th and 30th overs and managed three boundaries between overs 21 and 40.</p> <p>That was partly testament to King’s skilful leg-spinners – one of which Sciver-Brunt miscued to Sutherland at mid-off – but it perhaps also reflected some lingering nervousness in the England lineup after their two best batters, Sciver-Brunt and Heather Knight, departed early.</p> <p>Beaumont, who finally recovered some form and looked well set for three figures, ended up trying to force the pace, caught at long-on for 78. The catcher was Georgia Voll, playing her first match of the World Cup after Alyssa Healy was forced out because of a calf injury.</p> <p>Apparently, the rugby ball Voll had spent hours twirling on the bench had warmed her up for her big moment: the former Queensland Under-18 rugby league player leaped in the air, overbalanced and was able to parry the ball back in and take it at the second attempt.</p> <p>“That’s why this team’s so great,” Gardner told Sky Sports. “We win those small moments that end up being big moments.”</p> <p>Australia’s bowlers had been uncharacteristically wayward early on – Beaumont got her teeth into a free hit after Kim Garth overstepped, fetching her down the ground for six as England scored 55 runs in the opening eight overs. At the back end, Alice Capsey and Charlie Dean added some much-needed impetus, after Sutherland ran out of steam.</p> <p>The problem was the moments in between: Sciver-Brunt having a rare rush of blood against King; and a ghastly bit of cricket from Sophia Dunkley, who charged down the track to Gardner, got nowhere near the ball and tripped over her own legs in a fruitless effort to return to the crease.</p> <p>At that point, Alyssa Healy was spotted grinning and dancing in the dugout. “She’s tracking nicely, but day-by-day progress,” the stand‑in captain, Tahlia McGrath, told Sky Sports.</p> <p>Hope aplenty, then, that she will be back on the field ready to lead her side’s charge to what feels like another inevitable world title.</p>
