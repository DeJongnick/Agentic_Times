<p>The UK government is being pressed to wipe billions from the energy costs facing households and heavy industry by reforming the high taxes levied on electricity bills.</p> <p>These policy levies mean the UK pays some of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/20/why-the-uks-electricity-costs-are-so-high-and-what-can-be-done-about-it">highest energy bills in the world</a>, and are simultaneously disadvantaging British industry and stifling the efforts of households to transition to lower-carbon heating systems, according to industry trade groups.</p> <p>Make UK has warned that the government’s long-awaited industrial policy is at risk of being derailed by the high energy prices charged to UK manufacturers, which the lobby group states make the sector’s energy bills 46% higher than the global average.</p> <p>The trade organisation has called on the government to cut industrial energy costs as part of Labour’s long-awaited industrial strategy, which is due later this month, by reforming “the complex and unfair policy levies that make low-carbon energy more expensive than fossil fuels”.</p> <p>Its plan includes the state underwriting a fixed energy price for manufacturers. Under the scheme, manufacturing firms would receive top-up payments from the government if energy wholesale costs rise beyond the set price – but they would repay the difference to the exchequer if the wholesale price falls below the agreed price.</p> <p>Stephen Phipson, Make UK’s chief executive, said: “If we do not address the issue of high industrial energy costs in the UK as a priority, we risk the security of our country. We will fail to attract investment in the manufacturing sector and will rapidly enter a phase of renewed de-industrialisation.”</p> <p>“UK manufacturers have faced energy prices far above those of European competitors for many years, undermining their ability to invest, grow, and compete globally,” Phipson said.</p> <p>Another trade organisation, Energy UK, blamed the government’s levies, which predominantly fall on electricity bills, for making cleaner alternatives such heat pumps artificially expensive in comparison with gas.</p> <p>The energy sector trade body, which represents energy suppliers, has proposed “rebalancing” the charges currently levied on electricity bills on to gas bills, saving homes using electric heating £400 a year. State subsidies should then be used to ease the burden on low- and middle- income gas-using households that would face an extra annual cost of £40 under its proposal, it said.</p> <p>Overall the scheme would make the government’s move from gas heating to electric heating about £40bn cheaper by 2040 compared with a situation in which policy costs are not removed from bills.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “Through our clean power mission, we will get off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets – protecting business and household finances with clean, homegrown energy that we control.”</p> <p>The spokesperson said that it was bringing energy costs for UK industries closer in line with other major economies through its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huge-boost-for-uk-industry-as-government-supercharger-rolls-out">British Industry Supercharger</a>, a government energy cost-cutting programme for firms in sectors such as steel, metals and chemicals, which is expected to save businesses £5bn over the next 10 years.</p> <p>“We are also looking at a range of options for longer-term energy market reform, including the rebalancing of gas and electricity prices, with the impact on consumers at the heart of our approach,” the spokesperson added.</p> <p>The comments about the government’s imminent industrial strategy proposals come as British business faces a string of challenges over the coming months.</p> <p>The business and trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, is expected to urge Donald Trump’s administration to cut a deal to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/31/uk-trade-secretary-to-seek-exemption-from-us-steel-and-aluminium-tariffs">reduce taxes on UK steel exports to zero</a> this week, after the US president vowed to double his global steel tariff to 50%.</p> <p>Elsewhere, private sector companies expect activity to fall in the three months to August to their weakest level for three years, according to the CBI’s latest growth survey. A separate poll of the UK hospitality industry also stated that recent increases to employer national insurance contributions and the changes to business rates mean that a third of the sector is operating at a loss.</p>
