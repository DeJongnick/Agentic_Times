Used car prices were unsurprising, rising 0.3% month-to-month. <strong>Furniture</strong> and other goods also surprised us modestly on the downside.</p> <p>Six of the nine high-level services sub-components we have in our table surprised us to the downside, with volatile <strong>car insurance</strong> one of the minority with an upside surprise. <strong>Accommodation services</strong> also surprised us, rising 3.2% month-to-month, up from -2.2% in August and above our call of 2.7%. Still, broadly we expected a strong month for hotel months, which had been signalled by our tracker. </p> <p>A large drop was always likely as <strong>airfares</strong> unwound the unusually large seasonal rise between August and September. Airfares still boosted inflation 10bp compared to August, just 1bp less than we assumed, because prices fell even faster in September 2024. </p> <p><strong>Private school fees</strong> rose 4.4% month-to-month, strong given how much headline inflation has slowed from the peaks that helped support this component, but weaker than we’d expected given the possibility that schools would still be passing through the VAT hike on fees implemented in January. </p> <p>Elsewhere, <strong>catering services</strong> inflation ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2% in August but undershot our call, rent inflation slowed 0.1pp to 4.3%, again surprising our call, communication inflation dropped 140bp, much weaker than we assumed. Within other services inflation in our table, recreation and cultural services were much weaker than expected, falling 0.3% month-to-month. We’ll get into the details but suspect live music explains that.

CPI was collected late, on September 16, compared to the September 9 date we and we think the market expected, which will have weighed on air fares and hotel prices. Underlying services inflation remains close to 4% and surveys suggest it will stay there at least until the spring. Erratic movements in some components, and a surprise in rents that the MPC look through, explain <em>some</em> of the downside.</p> <p>But those caveats fail to over-ride the dovish news completely. So the five doves on the committee will likely take heart. <strong>A rate cut by December looks likely now.</strong> We still think the MPC will skip November—the growth data and stabilising jobs suggest they can afford to wait still—and the 26 November budget also seems forth waiting for, as well as another round of inflation data. We’ll chew over the data in detail today, but our initial reaction is that we will likely bring forward our rate cut call from February to December. We’re not throwing in the towel on our structural hawkish views, as we say we think the path down for inflation will be protracted.
