<p>An exiled Venezuelan human rights activist and a political consultant have been shot and wounded in an apparently targeted attack in Colombia’s capital.</p> <p>Yendri Omar Velásquez Rodríguez and Luis Alejandro Peche Arteaga were shot on Monday as they left a building in north Bogotá, Colombian police said.</p> <p>The men were reported to be in a stable condition in hospital, police said, adding that Velásquez was to undergo surgery.</p> <p>The Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who last week was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/10/venezuelan-politician-maria-corina-machado-wins-nobel-peace-prize">awarded the Nobel peace prize</a> for her pro-democracy activism, condemned the attack on social media and said the two men had been targeted by the government of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.</p> <p>According to Machado, Velásquez had sought refugee status in Colombia after being abducted in Venezuela in 2024 “for his work as a human rights defender”, while Peche “was also in Bogotá due to political persecution by the Maduro regime”.</p> <p>“This attack constitutes a serious aggression not only against them but against all the work of protecting and promoting human rights in the region,” Machado said.</p> <p>The Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, said on X that government security forces would expand their protection of human rights activists. “All Venezuelan citizens who seek asylum in Colombia, independent of their ideas, are welcome,” he wrote.</p> <p>Colombia’s ombudsman’s office criticised the attack and urged the attorney general’s office to investigate.</p> <p>Colombian police said they were not aware of threats against the two men in Colombia.</p> <p>Venezuela’s main opposition coalition, the Democratic Unitary Platform, condemned the attack.</p> <p>Velásquez is the founder of the Venezuelan Observatory of LGBTIQ+ Violence, and had sought asylum in Colombia. He was detained in August 2024 at Venezuela’s main international airport outside Caracas, when the country was still tense from Maduro’s claim of a re-election victory and thousands were arrested after public protests. He had been on his way to a rights defence event in Switzerland.</p> <p>The election results announced by the electoral council <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/30/venezuela-maduro-election-protests">sparked protests across the country</a>, to which the government responded with force that left more than 20 people dead.</p> <p>The government cancelled Velásquez’s passport and held him for about six hours, an incident highlighted in a report by the human rights group Provea.</p> <p>Peche Arteaga is a political consultant who has advised politicians, government institutions and private organisations. He was an adviser to Venezuela’s national assembly in 2017 and 2018, according to his social media profile.</p> <p>Colombia’s ombudsman’s office said “the Venezuelan people deserve to live in peace and democracy”, adding that Venezuelan migrants in Colombia should be afforded protections by authorities.</p>
