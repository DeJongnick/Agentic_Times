<p>It is incredibly disappointing to read that so many schools in England have implemented an outright ban on phone use (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/10/majority-of-schools-in-england-ban-mobile-phone-use-survey-shows">More than 90% of schools in England ban mobile phone use, survey shows, 10 April</a>). While student engagement and the addiction to phones and social media certainly need to be addressed, schools are more likely to support students’ development if they teach them how to use technology in ways that are healthy, purposeful and life-enhancing. A balanced, nuanced approach to phone use can still promote social interaction for children of all ages and encourage learning beyond the&nbsp;classroom.</p> <p>All students should be equipped to access quality information and transfer knowledge quicker in their pursuit of independent learning. If&nbsp;phones or tablets can help achieve that goal, maybe we should not be so quick to dismiss them in&nbsp;schools. </p> <p>Shouldn’t we instead aim to help students become confident in using digital devices in and out of school? How else will young people learn how to think critically and navigate online spaces filled with disinformation that is supercharged by artificial intelligence?<br><strong>Dr Robert Harrison</strong><br><em>Director of education and integrated technology, </em><em>ACS International Schools</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
