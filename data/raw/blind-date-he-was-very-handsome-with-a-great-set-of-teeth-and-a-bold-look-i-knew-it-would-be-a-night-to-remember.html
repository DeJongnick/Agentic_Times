<h2>Lewis on Max</h2> 
<p><strong>What were you hoping for?</strong><br>To meet someone nice, and if it seems like there’s a mutual interest there, to try not to laugh it off, but go with it!</p> 
<p><strong>First impressions?</strong><br>When the barman pointed Max to my table, I was quite happy.</p> 
<p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong><br>Our dissociation with the wider queer community, and Max’s desire “to do more gay stuff”. </p> 
<p><strong>Most awkward moment?</strong><br>Finding out Max was born post-2000 was a bit sickening …</p> 
<p><strong>Good table manners?</strong><br>He offered to go vegan for the night so we could share some dishes, which was very kind of him. </p> 
<p><strong>Best thing about Max?</strong><br>He’s very genuine, and a really good listener. Also, his relationship with his mum, who encouraged him to sign up for the blind date. A big thank you to Max’s mum!</p>

    <p>Blind date is Saturday’s dating column: every week, two strangers are paired up for dinner and drinks, and then spill the beans to us, answering a set of questions. This runs, with a photograph we take of each dater before the date, in Saturday magazine (in the UK) and online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date">theguardian.com</a>&nbsp;every Saturday. It’s been running since 2009 – you can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/31/10-years-of-blind-date-weddings-babies-lost-knickers">read all about how we put it together here</a>.<br><br><b>What questions will I be asked?</b><br>We ask about age, location, occupation, hobbies, interests and the type of person you are looking to meet. If you do not think these questions cover everything you would like to know, tell us what’s on your mind.</p>
    <p><b>Can I choose who I match with?</b><br>No, it’s a blind date! But we do ask you a bit about your interests, preferences, etc – the more you tell us, the better the match is likely to be.</p>
    <p><b>Can I pick the photograph?</b><br>No, but don't worry: we'll choose the nicest ones.</p>
    <p><b>What personal details will appear?</b><br>Your first name, job and age.</p>
    <p><b>How should I answer?</b><br>Honestly but respectfully. Be mindful of how it will read to your date, and that Blind date reaches a large audience, in print and online.</p>
    <p><b>Will I see the other person’s answers?<br></b>No. We may edit yours and theirs for a range of reasons, including length, and we may ask you for more details.</p>
    <p><b>Will you find me The One?<br></b>We’ll try! Marriage! Babies!</p>
    <p><b>Can I do it in my home town?<br></b>Only if it’s in the UK. Many of our applicants live in London, but we would love to hear from people living elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Would you introduce Max to your&nbsp;friends?</strong><br>Max – quite boldly – stated that Gavin &amp; Stacey wasn’t really his thing, so he’s got some atoning to do first.</p> 
<p><strong>Describe Max in three words</strong><br>Kind. Hopeful. Cowboy (yeehaw).</p> 
<p><strong>What do you think Max made of you?</strong><br>There was prolonged eye contact. </p> 
<p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong><br>To a pub for some nerdy Star Wars chat.</p> 
<p><strong>And … did you kiss?</strong><br>Hey, I don’t kiss’n’tell! Although we didn’t … so I guess I can?</p> 
<p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</strong><br>Max asked whether we’d be meeting up again. I said “yeah definitely”, but not in a very convincing way. I wish I’d just properly said YES!</p> 
<p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong><br>8.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you meet again?</strong><br>We’re planning on seeing each other in&nbsp;the next couple of weeks.</p> 
<h2>Max on Lewis</h2> 
<p><em> </em><strong>What were you hoping for?</strong><br>An escape from the swipe, and to prove to my mum I open the links she sends.</p> 
<p><strong>First impressions?</strong><br>Very handsome, with a great set of teeth and a bold look. I knew it would be a night to remember.</p> 
<p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong><br>The simple pleasures of bread and oil, the challenge of making new friends as an adult, and a mutual agreement that we needed to release our food babies from buckled belts.</p> 
<p><strong>Most awkward moment?</strong> <br>Watching Lewis explore the pub on his journey to find the bathroom. </p> 
<p><strong>Good table manners?</strong><br>I’ve never seen a pile of beans eaten with such grace and decorum.</p> 
<p><strong>Best thing about Lewis?</strong><br>His keen eye for finding beauty in the most unlikely places.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you introduce Lewis to your&nbsp;friends?</strong><br>If he promises to still hang out with me&nbsp;sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think Lewis made of you?</strong><br>I hope he felt I was worth spending an&nbsp;evening with.</p> 
<p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong><br>Yes, we joined an old lady at a pub.</p> 
<p><strong>And … did you kiss?</strong><br>No.</p> 
<p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</strong><br>That I sat next to him instead of across&nbsp;from him.</p> 
<p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong><br>8.</p>
