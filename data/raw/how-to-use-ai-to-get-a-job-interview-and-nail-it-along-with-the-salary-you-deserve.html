<h2><strong>Supercharge your research</strong></h2> <p>The fear that artificial intelligence (AI) will replace millions of jobs is widespread. But equally, in today’s tough job market, not using AI wisely as part of your search could mean you miss out. It’s a tricky balancing act to harness the technology’s power without losing the human touch. </p> <p>You can use AI models such as <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a> to research employers, competitors and industry trends before applying for a job.</p> <p>Hannah Salton, a careers coach, says some of her clients have successfully used AI to find out more about companies, allowing them to “gain insights into culture, competitors and market positioning. It can also help identify SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] to apply to or network with.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/feb/10/britons-hunting-for-a-job-uk-jobseekers-pay">‘It’s nightmarish’: why 1.5m Britons are still hunting for a job</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She says: “For example, you can ask ChatGPT to suggest SMEs with marketing teams based in your city if that’s who you are targeting. However, AI models aren’t always accurate, so cross-check your results using other sources.”</p> <p>AI can also be used to help you to spot shifts in your industry and identify the skills needed to future-proof your career.</p> <p>For example, <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-wg93fVwAj-jobsgpt-by-smarterx-ai">JobsGPT</a>, a tool from SmarterX, can analyse how a role in your industry is evolving, breaking it down into specific tasks and assessing which parts are most exposed to automation. This could help you to work out whether there are skills you need to acquire, or if you should consider moving into a more in-demand area.</p> <p>Eloise Skinner, a careers coach, says her clients also use AI to find industries and roles that match their skills and values, helping them to think beyond the jobs they would normally consider. Jobseekers can ask ChatGPT and Perplexity to suggest roles that align with their particular skills, passion and experience, for example.</p> <p>She says: “AI can suggest roles based on previous experience, values, ambitions and strongest skill sets. It might also summarise information about an industry or job, such as career prospects, work-life balance or salary expectations, helping candidates decide where to apply.”</p> <h2><strong>Stay human</strong></h2> <p>Hung Lee, the founder of the <a href="https://www.recruitingbrainfood.com/">Recruiting Brainfood</a> newsletter, says jobseekers often rush their applications because they are afraid that roles will be snapped up quickly. This urgency drives many to use AI to speed up the process. “It’s become an arms race,” he says. This trend has led to recruiters receiving a flood of generic AI-generated applications.</p>    <p>Martha Brook, who founded and runs her own stationery brand, says: “I recently received over 2,000 applications for a role within a week, and spotting AI-generated copy was surprisingly easy – it was an instant turn-off and in most cases led to immediate rejection.”</p> <p>She adds: “Aside from the obvious copy-and-paste jobs from ChatGPT, many applications regurgitated the job description and sounded generic. In a pool of thousands, I’m looking for candidates who sound human, showcase their unique voice and show they’ve done their research rather than relying on AI to do the heavy lifting.”</p> <p>Make sure your application stands out by sharing specific reasons for your interest in the role. Maybe you have used the company’s products, or its mission fits with your values. Tools such as ChatGPT, Grammarly and Hemingway can improve your grammar, clarity and readability, but use AI to refine your writing rather than create your application. Showcasing individuality and genuine enthusiasm is vital.</p> <h2><strong>Beat the screening systems</strong></h2> <p>Many large companies now use AI-powered applicant tracking systems (ATS) to screen CVs before they reach a human. These systems scan applications for particular keywords and phrases, ranking them based on how well they match the job description.</p> <p>“One of my clients was struggling with a wordy CV,” says Salton. “They used ChatGPT to highlight their key skills more concisely. But they were careful to keep their authentic voice.” For example, you could prompt ChatGPT to “refine my CV for clarity to highlight my key skills and experience in a concise, engaging way while preserving my voice”.</p> <p>Sign up to <a href="https://premium.linkedin.com/career-features">LinkedIn Premium Career</a> (£29.99 a month after a free trial), and you benefit from a host of AI-powered jobseeking tools.</p> <p>These include a profile-writing assistant that also acts as a CV enhancer. You can refine your headline and summary, which LinkedIn claims can make you visible for nearly twice as many job opportunities. You can also highlight three advertised jobs a month as top choices, making your profile stand out to recruiters with a verified badge and a personalised message when applying.</p> <p>And you can also message recruiters directly, even without being connected. LinkedIn is rolling out a job-match feature that shows you how your skills and experience fit particular jobs to focus your search.</p> <h2><strong>Sharpen interview skills</strong></h2>    <p>AI can be a useful interview practice tool. “Saying your answers out loud provides a more natural and immersive practice experience,” says Skinner. “It helps you hear how you actually sound, which can be revealing. But use it alongside practice with real people – that’s still essential.”</p> <p>ChatGPT’s advanced voice mode, for example, can provide feedback on your delivery. This can pinpoint weak areas that you need to work on, building confidence for the real event. Open ChatGPT and activate the voice mode on the search bar. Ask it to conduct a mock interview for a particular role after providing the job details and give feedback on your answers.</p> <p>Platforms such as <a href="https://grow.google/intl/uk/">Google’s digital skills training</a> offer AI-powered career coaching so that you can speak clearly about your achievements.</p> <p>However, be prepared at an actual interview to discuss your AI usage if it played a role in the application process. Transparency about how you used AI to prepare can demonstrate adaptability and a practical approach to technology.</p> <p>And, just as with your CV, Julia Morgon, a director at the recruitment agency Brook Street, says: “Don’t forget to inject your own personality into an interview. What makes you different from your colleagues is what employers see the most value in. AI can’t help you stand out as an individual on the day.”</p> <h2><strong>Know your worth</strong></h2> <p>Use AI-powered platforms such as <a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/index.htm">Glassdoor</a> and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/salary/"> </a><a href="https://www.payscale.com/">Payscale</a> to research potential salaries and boost your negotiating position. You may discover, for example, that some companies consistently pay above the market rate. AI-powered salary tools can also highlight regional salary differences and remote working pay variations.</p> <p>As roles evolve, salaries change, too. The average British worker changes jobs every five years, according to a study by the insurer LV=. Understanding these trends is vital when negotiating an offer.</p> <p>For more detailed salary insights, platforms such as Totaljobs and Reed can provide up-to-date pay&nbsp;data based on industry, location and experience level. This could help you benchmark offers more accurately.</p> <p>Tom Buckell, a director at the recruitment company Manpower UK, says you can use what you learned in your research in your contract negotiations, asking about flexibility around shifts, for examples, or opportunities for training. “This also gives you more options for increasing non-salary related benefits if your potential employer can’t meet your wage expectations,” he adds. </p>
