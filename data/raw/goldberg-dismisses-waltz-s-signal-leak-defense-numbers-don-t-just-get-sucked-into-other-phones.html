<p>The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg has dismissed the explanation offered by the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, for how he was included in a Trump administration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/signal-group-chat-leak">group text chat</a> about – and in advance of – the recent bombing of Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/who-is-jeffrey-goldberg-atlantic-signal-chat-leak">Goldberg</a> said Waltz’s theory that his contact was “sucked in” to his phone via “somebody else’s contact” was implausible.</p> <p>“This isn’t The Matrix,” Goldberg <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/goldberg-says-it-s-not-true-that-he-and-waltz-never-spoke-prior-to-signal-leak-full-interview-235799109514">told</a> NBC’s Kristen Welker on Sunday’s Meet the Press, referring to the classic science fiction movie about humans unknowingly living in a simulated reality. “Phone numbers don’t just get sucked into other phones.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/judge-orders-signal-chat-group-messages-preservation">Judge orders participants in Signal chat group blunder to preserve all messages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I don’t know what he’s talking about there.”</p> <p>Goldberg continued: “You know, very frequently in journalism, the most obvious explanation is the explanation. My phone number was in his phone because my phone number is in his phone.”</p> <p>Goldberg made waves when the magazine, over two days beginning 24 March, published details of a group chat that included senior <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration officials</a> discussing a then imminent US attack on Houthi installations and senior personnel.</p> <p>The chat, on the Signal app, unnerved many in Washington about the security precautions being taken by neophyte administration officials to ensure national security, triggering several days of headlines over whether the texts amounted to a breach.</p> <p>Donald Trump on Sunday repeated his position that the disclosures were a mistake – and the president denied reports that Waltz had offered to resign. “No, he didn’t,” Trump said. “There was no reason for him to.”</p> <p>Earlier, Trump said Waltz is “a very good man, and he will continue to do a good job”.</p> <p>On Sunday, Goldberg claimed that Waltz was “telling everyone that he’s never met me or spoken to me – that’s simply not true”. Waltz had said during a meeting with Trump and ambassadors at the White House that he “never met” Goldberg.</p> <p>“There’s a lot of journalists … who have made big names for themselves making up lies about this president,” Waltz said, without offering evidence. Referring to Goldberg, he added: “This one in particular I’ve never met, don’t know, never communicated with, and we are looking into and reviewing how the heck he got into this room.”</p> <p>The national security council (NSC) confirmed the authenticity of the messages and said it was reviewing how Goldberg got into the Waltz-initiated chat. Theories range from unintentionally selecting Goldberg’s number; his number being under the name of a security official supposed to be included; to intentional sabotage.</p> <p>But Goldberg told NBC News: “This has become a somewhat farcical situation. There’s no subterfuge here. My number was in his phone. He mistakenly added me to the group chat. There we go.”</p> <p>The Democratic US senator Mark Warner continued to press the issue on Sunday, saying the Republican White House officials involved in the Signal breach risked American lives.</p> <p>“If you had been a traditional military officer or a CIA caseworker and you were this sloppy and careless with this classified information, you would be fired,” Warner, of Virginia, told the host Martha Raddatz on ABC’s This Week. “No doubt about it.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/28/what-is-signal-the-messaging-app-at-the-heart-of-a-us-security-leak">What is Signal, the messaging app at the heart of a US security leak?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Warner – a member of the Senate intelligence committee – said he, too, uses Signal because it is safer than texting. “I actually encourage people to use Signal. But that still doesn’t mean, because it’s safer, you can put classified information” on there, he added.</p> <p>The congressman Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican and former chair of the US House’s intelligence committee, told the same outlet that he welcomed a review into what has come to be known as Signalgate and “whether or not these types of conversations should occur”.</p> <p>Nonetheless, he said he considered the Houthi strikes “a great operation”.</p> <p>Susan Rice, who served as the national security adviser to the former president Barack Obama, told the MeidasTouch podcast that the leak was “extraordinarily reckless” and “unprecedented”.</p> <p>Rice said even the existence of the conversations is classified.</p> <p>“This would never be tolerated in a normal administration,” Rice said. “They’d be fired on the spot.”</p>
