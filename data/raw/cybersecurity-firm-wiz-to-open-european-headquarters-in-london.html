<p>Cybersecurity firm Wiz, which last month <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/23/cybersecurity-firm-wiz-rejects-bid-google-alphabet">rejected a $23bn (£18bn) takeover bid from Google’s parent company, Alphabet</a>, is to open a European headquarters in London – a move that is a major shot in the arm for the UK’s aspiration to be a global tech hub.</p> <p>The new office, the company’s first in Europe, will be run by co-founder and research and development head, Roy Reznik, who is relocating from Israel to the UK capital to underscore the company’s business ambitions in the region.</p> <p>Wiz is likely to embark on a hiring spree, aiming to increase its UK employee base by 100 by the end of this year, and generate 35% of total revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa by the end of next year.</p> <p>Wiz already has several dozen UK-based employees, but they are focused on sales and marketing and are not based in an office. The recruitment plans include building its engineering, research and development capabilities.</p> <p>Wiz offers a service that scans the data on cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for security risks.</p> <p>It works with companies including Asos, the Bank of England and Revolut in the UK, and Shell, BMW and luxury goods conglomerate LVMH in Europe.</p> <p>“The UK is a region with many leading global brands and top tech talent, which is why we see it as key to the growth and expansion of Wiz,” Reznik told the Guardian.</p> <p>“Organisations in this market are embracing the cloud and capitalising on the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI). At the same time, with only 10% of data having migrated to the cloud so far, we see near limitless growth potential,” he added.</p> <p>The company made annual revenues of $350m last year and is understood to be running at a rate of $500m for this year. Wiz’s target is to hit $1bn in annual revenues and then consider its strategic options.</p> <p>Alphabet had been in talks to acquire Wiz in an effort to catch up with rivals Microsoft and Amazon in the hyper-competitive cloud services market.</p> <p>Last month, Wiz bosses admitted it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/23/cybersecurity-firm-wiz-rejects-bid-google-alphabet">“tough” turning down such lucrative offers</a> but said the goal remains growth and an eventual initial public offering. However, the New York-based startup said it is planning for a US listing, and not a London one.</p> <p>There had been scepticism that the deal with Alphabet would pass regulatory scrutiny, as regulators seek to toughen their stance against big tech dealmaking.</p> <p>In June, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission struck a deal on investigations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/06/microsoft-openai-and-nvidia-investigated-over-possible-breach-of-antitrust-laws">into the main protagonists in the AI market</a>, including Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia.</p> <p>In December last year, Adobe abandoned its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/24/adobe-cant-photoshop-out-the-fact-its-20bn-figma-deal-is-a-naked-land-grab">$20bn (£16bn) takeover of its smaller rival Figma</a>, after European and UK regulators raised concerns it would eliminate competition in the product design software market.</p> <p>In May, Wiz announced that it raised $1bn at a $12bn valuation, in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive Capital.</p> <p>The company has secured $1.9bn in total funding since being founded in 2020.</p>
