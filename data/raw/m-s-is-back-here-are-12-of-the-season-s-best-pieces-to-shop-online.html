<p>M&amp;S is <em>finally</em> back after a cyber-attack forced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/m-s-marks-and-spencer-website-online-orders-cyber-attack">the retailer to pause all online orders</a> – losing an estimated £25m a week. It’s not completely back to normal: click and collect is not available, many items are out of stock while the lines are gradually added, and online delivery is not yet back up and running in Northern Ireland. But as of today, many fashion ranges are available again in England, Scotland and Wales.</p> <p>So to celebrate M&amp;S’s online return – and show the beloved British brand a bit of support – we’ve rounded up your favourite pieces from our fashion experts’ picks over the past few months. From versatile holiday dresses to stylish yet comfortable men’s pyjamas, we’re glad to have them back.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Our favourite M&amp;S fashion picks</strong></h2> <p>***</p>    <p><strong>Polka dot sweetheart neckline maxidress</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/lyocell-rich-polka-dot-sweetheart-neckline-maxi-waisted-dress/p/clp60731457"><sub>£79 at M&amp;S</sub></a></p> <p>“Marks &amp; Spencer has gone big on the polka dot this season,” said fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley in her column on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/21/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-spots-or-stripes-the-good-news-is-you-no-longer-have-to-choose">spots and stripes</a>. This maxidress would be lovely for holiday dinners out and wouldn’t look amiss at a wedding. It also comes in petite, regular or tall. Cartner-Morley suggests wearing it with “flats instead of wedges, and a slicked-back bun rather than barrel curls, to keep it modern”.</p> <p><em><strong>For more, check out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/21/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-spots-or-stripes-the-good-news-is-you-no-longer-have-to-choose">spots or stripes?

It comes in 14 different colours, and can be bought in regular or slim fit (Peter recommends sizing up for a more expensive-looking finish).</p> <p>***</p>    <p><strong>Knitted round neck midi dress</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/cotton-blend-knitted-round-neck-midi-dress/p/clp60717811"><sub>£39.50 at M&amp;S</sub></a></p> <p>Still looking for that perfect holiday dress that can seamlessly go from beach to restaurant? Look no further. “The hero piece of this season is the main-character-energy beach dress. This is a dress that complements your swimwear, rather than concealing it,” says Cartner-Morley. This chic crochet dress ticks all the boxes.</p> <p><em><strong>For more, check out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/28/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-the-beach-dress-is-this-summes-must-have">Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: the beach dress is this summer’s must</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/28/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-the-beach-dress-is-this-summes-must-have">-have</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p>    <p><strong>Chanel</strong><strong>-style jacket</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/tweed-checked-fringed-jacket/p/clp60710745"><sub>£69 at M&amp;S</sub></a></p> <p>The Chanel-style tweed jacket is a classic for a reason. M&amp;S’s take on the timeless style is infinitely wearable and the perfect antidote to chillier summer evenings. “You could pair it with jeans and metallic ballet pumps for a relaxed, but smart look. But I’d also wear it with wide-leg linen trousers and slingbacks for garden parties,” says styling editor Melanie Wilkinson.</p> <p><em><strong>For more, check out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/mar/11/best-chanel-style-jacket">the best Chanel-style jackets to rival the real thing</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p>    <p><strong>V-neck frill detail midaxi dress</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/v-neck-frill-detail-midaxi-relaxed-dress/p/clp60725159?color=KHAKIMIX"><sub>£45 at M&amp;S</sub></a></p> <p>Shopping for weddings can be a bit of a nightmare – you fork out all that money on an expensive dress and then wear it only a couple of times a year. Instead, opt for one you can wear all season. This drop-waist dress has a “relaxed feel and flattering frill neckline [that] will serve you well, from wedding dancefloors to casual dinners and summer lounging,” says fashion writer Ellie Violet Bramley in her roundup of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jun/06/best-wedding-guest-dresses-uk">the best wedding guest dresses</a>.</p> <p>***</p>    <p><strong>Pure cotton striped </strong><strong>boxers</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/5pk-pure-cotton-striped-woven-boxers/p/clp60636718"><sub>£30 for five at M&amp;S</sub></a></p> <p>Another hot tip from Bevan’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/30/men-summer-wardrobe-updates-uk">summer wardrobe updates for men</a> is to channel Paul Mescal’s love for short shorts and wear oversized boxers as outerwear. “I’d suggest sizing up for a roomier fit – and don’t forget to wear your underwear beneath to avoid any embarrassing mishaps,” he says. This affordable five-pack comes in a striped pattern that wouldn’t be instantly recognisable as boxers.</p> <p>***</p>    <p><strong>Embroidered relaxed shirt</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/emroidered-collared-relaxed-shirt-with-linen/p/clp60734843"><sub>£59 at M&amp;S</sub></a></p> <p>This embroidered shirt will serve you well across the whole summer, whether for a coffee date or a relaxed fit for the office (providing you wear something underneath to spare your colleagues’ blushes).
