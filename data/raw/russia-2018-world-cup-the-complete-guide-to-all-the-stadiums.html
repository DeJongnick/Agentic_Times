  <h2>Kazan Arena<br></h2> <p><strong><br></strong></p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/kazan-zip/giv-3902KCgNxNMBzePy/" data-alt="Kazan Arena"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/kazan-zip/giv-3902KCgNxNMBzePy/">Kazan Arena</a> <figcaption>Kazan Arena</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>45,379<br></p> <p><strong>Completed: </strong>July 2013<br></p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$439.7m<br></p> <p><strong>Games at Russia 2018 </strong>France v Australia, <em>16 June;</em> Iran v Spain, <em>20 June;</em> Poland v Colombia, <em>24 June;</em> South Korea v Germany, <em>27 June;</em> Round of 16, <em>30 June;</em> Quarter-final, <em>6 July</em>.</p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>Kazan considers itself Russia’s “sporting capital” and the Kazan Arena is one of an impressive array of stylish, modern – and expensive – sporting facilities to have sprung up there in recent years. It was designed by Populous, the architects behind Wembley and the Emirates, and was built in time for the 2013 Summer Universiade, where it hosted football and athletics. As a sleek, modern facility it will serve the World Cup well – even if it will, amazingly, be one of the tournament’s oldest stadiums.</p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong>Anyone who gets lost en route should just look for the high-definition screen – the world’s biggest outdoor one, organisers proudly proclaim – on the side of the stadium. It covers 4,030 square metres and will probably bear both competing nations’ flags on a given matchday. Those arriving from the air may want to appreciate the waterlily-themed roof of this riverside stadium.</p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>Nothing major. The Confederations Cup was a successful dry run and the Russia v Iran friendly went off without any problems in October. Access could be better though: the stadium lies to the north-east of the city centre, away from the metro, and taxis were sometimes discouraged from operating in its vicinity during last summer’s tournament.</p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong>Rubin Kazan, the Russian Premier League side, moved to the Kazan Arena from the Communist-era Central Stadium – which is situated near the city centre and well worth visiting – in 2014 and will continue to be based there. In common with most of next summer’s stadiums there are plenty of seats to go round for club games: Kazan’s average attendance in the recently-completed season was 9,706. In order to pay off the cost of a facility that ended up costing nearly three times more than the initially mooted $155m there will be an emphasis on hosting cultural and commercial events too – and if Kazan’s long-term ambitions bear fruit it could even host Olympic events one day.</p>    <h2>Ekaterinburg Arena</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/ekaterinburg-zip/giv-3902hPmGNccHF5ST/" data-alt="Ekaterinburg Arena"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/ekaterinburg-zip/giv-3902hPmGNccHF5ST/">Ekaterinburg Arena</a> <figcaption>Ekaterinburg Arena</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>35,696<br></p> <p><strong>Completed: </strong>March 2018 (upgrade of stadium originally built in 1957)</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$215m</p> <p><strong>Games hosted at Russia 2018: </strong>Egypt v Uruguay, <em>15 June;</em> France v Peru, <em>21 June;</em> Japan v Senegal, <em>24 June;</em> Mexico v Sweden, <em>27 June</em>.</p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>As with the Luzhniki some 1,000 miles away, the old Central Stadium in Ekaterinburg has been renovated for next summer’s competition. It is a year younger than the national stadium, dating back to 1957, and is the long-term home of Soviet league stalwarts Uralmash – these days known as FC Ural. Full international football has yet to take place here although Russia’s under-21s have passed through three times. The ground’s biggest past dalliance with global significance came in 1959, when it held the World Allround Speed Skating Championships.</p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong>The new stadium soars high above the vestiges of its predecessor but does, at least, retain the old facade – which, like at the Luzhniki, is quite a work of art. But the biggest point of interest may be the temporary stands behind each goal that sit outside the main stadium structure. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/04/russia-world-cup-stadium-ekaterinburg-arena-seating-built-outside-venue-fifa">Such a bizarre sight</a> triggered widespread media interest, and some ridicule, in October.</p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>It took some time to settle on a final design, mainly in order to preserve the existing facade, so construction started fairly late. The solution that has been settled upon is certainly eccentric, but Fifa insists the temporary stands were the most cost-effective and practical way to ensure the required 35,000 capacity. Just make sure you bring your binoculars.</p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong>Those temporary stands will be taken down and capacity reduced to manageable 23,000 – which seems more than ideal for FC Ural, who will play here after the World Cup and flirted with relegation from Russia’s top flight last season.</p>    <h2>Fisht Stadium</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/sochi-zip/giv-3902HMRxqmKORZ6n/" data-alt="Map of Fisht Stadium"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/sochi-zip/giv-3902HMRxqmKORZ6n/">Map of Fisht Stadium</a> <figcaption>Map of Fisht Stadium</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>47,659<br></p> <p><strong>Completed: </strong>December 2013</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$519m</p> <p><strong>Games hosted at Russia 2018: </strong>Portugal v Spain, <em>15 June;</em> Belgium v Panama, <em>18 June;</em> Germany v Sweden, <em>23 June; </em>Australia v Peru, <em>26 June;</em> Round of 16, <em>30 June;</em> Quarter-final, <em>7 July.</em></p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>This venue is no stranger to big events, having been conceived and delivered for the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. When it hosts the World Cup it will become the second stadium – along with Turin’s Stadio Olimpico – to have held both events. Four Confederations Cup games were held here and Russia drew 3-3 with Belgium in a friendly eight months ago.</p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong>The view beyond the stadium’s open north end, taking in the Krasnaya Polyana mountains, will be something to behold, while the Black Sea is visible to the south. It is a spectacular location and the sweeping roofs of its two main stands are certainly dramatic.</p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>Nothing significant where the World Cup is concerned, although it needed some expensive reconfigurations – notably the removal of its roof – to comply with Fifa regulations. The biggest issue may be its location: it is actually in Adler, around 18 miles from the centre of Sochi, although supporters coped during a successful run at the Confederations Cup and it is well placed for the airport.</p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong>It would have been a touch embarrassing if Sochi, currently without a functioning professional club, had no team to play in its own venue after the World Cup. How fortunate, then, that Dinamo St Petersburg – a moderate second-tier outfit – have decided that the best way to escape Zenit’s shadow is to move 1,500 miles and start afresh there next season. Crowds may still be low, though, and the annual maintenance cost of the stadium could reach $8m so international games and training camps will be among the events relied upon to fill the void. Its capacity will be reduced when the tournament is over, although reports vary as to by how much.</p>    <h2>Kaliningrad Stadium</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/kaliningrad-zip/giv-3902sUurnyaB41CT/" data-alt="Kaliningrad Stadium"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/kaliningrad-zip/giv-3902sUurnyaB41CT/">Kaliningrad Stadium</a> <figcaption>Kaliningrad Stadium</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>35,212</p> <p><strong>Completed: </strong>March 2018</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$300m</p> <p><strong>Games hosted at Russia 2018: </strong>Croatia v Nigeria, <em>16 June;</em> Serbia v Switzerland, <em>22 June;</em> Spain v Morocco, <em>25 June;</em> England v Belgium, <em>28 June</em>.</p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>This brand new facility will provide the Russian exclave, squeezed in between Poland and Lithuania, with an impressive stadium whose concept was originally based on the Allianz Arena. It is situated on Oktyabrsky Island, to the east of the city centre – a picturesque setting that had effectively been a wilderness for many years until this project began.</p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong>The location is probably Kaliningrad Stadium’s most seductive factor. Design-wise, the stadium is fairly functional even if it is easy enough on the eye.</p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>Oktyabrsky Island has proved a difficult location, largely because wetland grass does not make the soundest foundation for major structures. The original, more ambitious, design for the stadium included a bigger capacity and a retractable roof: financial concerns ended up scuppering that, as did the fact that the company which drew up the plans went bankrupt four years ago. It all meant that ground was not broken on the revised, simplified project until September 2015 but Kaliningrad is ready for the World Cup.</p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong>The capacity will be cut to around 25,000 after the World Cup and Baltika Kaliningrad, the local side, will play here. It risks being another venue that is rarely filled: the club have not played in the Russian top flight for two decades and typical crowds at their current Baltika Stadium home number in the low thousands. They did sell out both the stadium’s pre-tournament test matches, though, while concerts and other events are also expected to take place here. Beyond sport, Oktyabrsky Island and its surrounds will benefit from a new residential development as well as parks and riverside embankments.</p>    <h2>Spartak Stadium</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/moscow-zip/giv-3902RDC76pUv7pvQ/" data-alt="Spartak Stadium, Moscow"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/moscow-zip/giv-3902RDC76pUv7pvQ/">Spartak Stadium, Moscow</a> <figcaption>Spartak Stadium, Moscow</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>45,360</p> <p><strong>Completed:</strong> September 2014</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$430m</p> <p><strong> </strong><strong>Games hosted at Russia 2018: </strong>Argentina v Iceland,<em> 16 June;</em> Poland v Senegal, <em>19 June;</em> Belgium v Tunisia, <em>23 Ju</em><em>ne;</em> Brazil v Serbia, <em>27 June;</em> Round of 16, <em>3 July.</em></p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>The Otkrytiye Arena was conceived as a home for Spartak Moscow – who had never really had a home to call their own despite their status as one of Russia’s leading clubs. A long-term project to change that finally gathered speed in the mid-2000s, with ground broken in July 2007. It proved something of a false dawn, with a number of delays and quibbles about the design putting the project on ice, but by September 2014 Spartak at last had a permanent abode, the Russian national team had another occasional venue – and the World Cup had a stadium that should be popular among supporters.</p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong>The statue of the Thracian gladiator Spartacus, situated in front of the stadium, will be the most popular photo opportunity for visitors here – while the outer shell of the ground, usually strikingly patterned in Spartak’s red and white, can take on the colours of the Russian flag. But the arena itself is enjoyable to spend time in – it was purpose-built for club football and feels that way. The stands are close to the pitch and it is easy to generate an atmosphere, as around 15,000 Chile fans showed to fine effect at the Confederations Cup.</p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>Nothing significant where World Cup preparations are concerned, although the stadium was originally due to be completed before Russia’s hosting was even announced. It proved a fun, lively venue last summer; a minor gripe would be that, although the stadium has its own metro station and is easy enough to access in around half an hour from the city centre, those looking to get out quickly afterwards may find congestion scuppers their best-laid plans.</p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong>Spartak will continue playing here, and the national team will doubtless make further appearances. Several major rock concerts have taken place inside the stadium, a trend that will doubtless continue. A new residential development is also planned for an area that, although not unfavourably situated, is somewhat barren.<br></p>    <h2>Luzhniki Stadium</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/moscow-zip/giv-3902RDC76pUv7pvQ/" data-alt="Luzhniki Stadium"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/moscow-zip/giv-3902RDC76pUv7pvQ/">Luzhniki Stadium</a> <figcaption>Luzhniki Stadium</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>80,000</p> <p><strong>Completed: </strong>June 2017</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$400m</p> <p><strong>Games hosted at Russia 2018: </strong>Russia v Saudi Arabia, <em>14 June;</em> Germany v Mexico, <em>17 June;</em> Portugal v Morocco, <em>20 June;</em> Denmark v France,<em> 26 June;</em> Round of 16, <em>1 July;</em> Semi-final, <em>11 July;</em> Final, <em>15 July</em>.</p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>The grand dame of Russia’s stadiums may not need too much introduction. She has been around since 1956 and has a long, eventful history that includes hosting the 1980 Olympics, the 1999 Uefa Cup final, the 2008 Champions League final between Manchester United and Chelsea, and the 2013 World Athletics Championships. In Communist times it was known as the Central Lenin Stadium and was the most important ground in the USSR. It has hosted more than 3,000 games at club and international level – including November’s friendly between Russia and Argentina, which was its official reopening after an extensive renovation before the World Cup.</p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong>This is one of those stadiums whose history you can smell as soon as you get within a few hundred yards. Its classic Soviet facade has been preserved and anyone attending a game will almost certainly walk past the huge statue of Lenin that guards the front entrance. From the concourses there are fine views over the city, and especially the spectacular Moscow State University building. The modernisation has been carried out tastefully: it is a stadium fit for a World Cup final.</p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>Nothing major, although a small fire in October 2015 caused brief alarm. The renovated ground was delivered on time and the Russia v Argentina match was – along with a subsequent fixture against Brazil – a successful dry run for this summer. There were long queues to access the transport system after the first game, though: a useful tip could be to dart south-east and head out to Vorobyovy Gory station rather than joining the hordes looking to access the Luzhniki or Sportivnaya stations to the north.</p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong>Luzhniki’s place in the future of Russian sport is perfectly secure. It will be the national team’s home, even though they will doubtless make use of the other major facilities that have sprung up for this tournament, and will continue to host big domestic games too. Further European finals are surely a possibility.</p>    <h2>Nizhny Novgorod Stadium</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/nizhny-novgorod-zip/giv-3902ELf5o2RBoGyf/" data-alt="Nizhny Novgorod Stadium"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/nizhny-novgorod-zip/giv-3902ELf5o2RBoGyf/">Nizhny Novgorod Stadium</a> <figcaption>Nizhny Novgorod Stadium</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>44,899</p> <p><strong>Completed: </strong>February 2018</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$290m<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Games hosted at Russia 2018: </strong>Sweden v South Korea, <em>18 June;</em> Argentina v Croatia, <em>21 June;</em> England v Panama, <em>24 June;</em> Switzerland v Costa Rica, <em>27 June;</em> Round of 16,<em> 1 July; </em>Quarter-final, <em>6 July</em>.</p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>Ground was broken on this new stadium in March 2015. It is situated in Strelka, a western district of Nizhny Novgorod, and is one of several World Cup stadiums to be placed attractively by a river – or two, in this case, at the confluence of the Volga and the Oka. Work on the project finished during the winter and the curtain was raised with a match between local side Olimpiyets and Zenit St Petersburg’s second string on 17 April.</p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong>The design promises to be one of the World Cup’s most striking, with slim pillars supporting from the outside and surrounding a semi-transparent facade. But the view over the 500-year-old Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin is the real selling point and the sense of place should be strong.</p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>Plumes of black smoke were seen rising from the site last October after a fire broke out. It looked more serious than it was, thankfully, and appears to have had little impact on either the delivery or those working on the project. This aside, the process has been relatively smooth.</p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong>Olimpiyets will play their games here and the second-tier club, not remotely a big fish, will hope the surge in interest seen during the stadium’s three warm-up fixtures continues. In May, 42,000 packed in for a match against Luch-Energiya Vladivostok, a barely believable figure for that level. The novelty will surely wear off although other sports may well be played inside the arena, too.</p>    <h2>Rostov Arena</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/rostov-on-don-zip/giv-3902TpQ2w5g6Jvln/" data-alt="Rostov Arena"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/rostov-on-don-zip/giv-3902TpQ2w5g6Jvln/">Rostov Arena</a> <figcaption>Rostov Arena</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>45,145</p> <p><strong>Completed: </strong>December 2017</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$330m</p> <p><strong>Games hosted at Russia 2018: </strong>Brazil v Switzerland, <em>17 June;</em> Uruguay v Saudi Arabia, <em>20 June; </em>South Korea v Mexico, <em>23 June; </em>Iceland v Croatia, <em>26 June; </em>Round of 16, <em>2 July</em>.</p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>Situated on the banks of the River Don, this is another brand new facility and one that – like several of its peers – has suffered a few false starts. Eventually construction began towards the end of 2014 and the finishing touches were just about done by Christmas last year, although this was seven months after the originally mooted completion date.</p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong>Rostov Arena will be notable for its roof – which imitates the meanderings of the river. There are attractive views over that and the south-west Russian city.</p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>In common with some of the other stadiums, the plans for Rostov Arena were downsized after original projections were judged to have overreached. The initial plan was a joy to behold – a modern, teardrop-shaped venue that promised to be unique. Eventually spiralling costs put paid to that; the pared-down version is fine but will have little to really distinguish it from the rest. Despite these conscientious efforts to save money, reports suggest the end product cost only 15% less than had been planned for its more lavish predecessor.</p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong>FC Rostov, who were known as the “Russian Leicester” during their surprise title push three seasons ago, will move in. The capacity will be reduced by around 5,000. The stadium will be the focal point for a wider redevelopment of the Don’s left bank – with shops, restaurants and business premises planned.</p>    <h2>Saint Petersburg Stadium</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/11/stpetersburg-zip/giv-3902rSNhFZZ9YNaG/" data-alt="Saint Petersburg Stadium"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/11/stpetersburg-zip/giv-3902rSNhFZZ9YNaG/">Saint Petersburg Stadium</a> <figcaption>Saint Petersburg Stadium</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>64,287</p> <p><strong>Completed: </strong>April 2017</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$1.5bn (rumoured)</p> <p><strong>Games hosted at Russia 2018: </strong>Morocco v Iran, <em>15 June;</em> Russia v Egypt, <em>19 June; </em>Brazil v Costa Rica, <em>22 June; </em>Nigeria v Argentina,<em> 26 June;</em> Round of 16, <em>3 July; </em>Semi-final, <em>10 July;</em> Third place play-off, <em>14 July</em>.<br></p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>Krestovsky Stadium was supposed to be one of the world’s most exciting, cutting-edge sports arenas. That may still be the case but the path here has been fraught with delays, soaring costs and numerous controversies – denting the pride many in Vladimir Putin’s home city feel about its new attraction. It took a decade to build and was finished eight years after the originally mooted completion deadline. That would have predated Russia’s securing of the World Cup and made for a much smaller, lower-key venue; the project rapidly escalated in scope after 2010 and it became, according to some estimates, the world’s most expensive football stadium.<br></p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong>The stadium is, for those not counting the cost at least, worth the wait. Its vertiginous stands are spectacular, the views out on to the Gulf of Finland from behind the seats are wonderful and the ‘Spaceship’ design is unmistakable. For anyone wanting to make sure of a few thrills before the football kicks off, the vast park on the approach to the ground contains a number of decidedly white-knuckle rollercoasters.<br></p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>Far more than could be listed in this space. But the practical niggles encountered in the past year or two have commanded particular attention – they include a serially leaky roof, which some officials have attributed to damage caused by cormorants, and a pitch initially found to have vibrated seven times more than the permissible limit. Concerns have also been raised about the levels of formaldehyde and ammonia in the materials used to finish some of the internal structure. On a matchgoing level, thousands of supporters were caught out by the mile-long walk from the nearest metro station at the Confederations Cup, meaning the stadium started filling up only towards half-time. These troubles perhaps pale into insignificance when an in-depth investigation last year by the Norwegian magazine Josimar, which alleged at least 110 North Koreans had been working at Krestovsky in atrocious conditions, comes into play.<br></p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong>Zenit St Petersburg will continue to play here – after some early false starts that saw them return to their old Petrovsky Stadium – and hope that the facility helps them push on in their quest to become a more consistent European force. Whether they can ever fill it remains moot, although 50,000 came through the turnstiles when they beat Celtic in last season’s Europa League and their average attendance is not too far short of that.</p>    <h2>Samara Arena</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/samara-zip/giv-3902YYuFXHhb3vd7/" data-alt="Samara Arena"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/samara-zip/giv-3902YYuFXHhb3vd7/">Samara Arena</a> <figcaption>Samara Arena</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>44,807</p> <p><strong>Completed: </strong>April 2018</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$320m</p> <p><strong>Games hosted at Russia 2018: </strong>Costa Rica v Serbia, <em>17 June</em><em>; </em>Denmark v Australia,<em> 21 June; </em>Uruguay v Russia, <em>25 June;</em> Senegal v Colombia, <em>28 June; </em>Round of 16, <em>2 July;</em> Quarter-final, <em>7 July</em>.</p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>Ground for the Cosmos Arena was broken in 2014. The project has been controversial locally and its originally mooted location on an island outside the city was rejected after heavy criticism. It was not an easy ride towards construction although the end product, amid an attractive green setting, is pleasing to the eye.</p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong> One of the tournament’s more striking venues. Samara is proud of its history as one of the primary hubs of the Soviet space programme and the 65m-high glass dome, which will be lit up at night, promises to be spectacular. The city itself should be an enjoyable visit – raw, energetic and beautifully situated at the confluence of the Samara and Volga rivers.</p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>Samara is arguably the bad boy of Russia’s stadium projects. It was riddled with delays, while costs soared and by mid-2015 it was already more than €40m over its original budget. That contributed to a change of constructor in early 2016. A number of tweaks to the original plan – including a downscaling of the dome, intended to be 80m high – had to be made to cut costs and prevent it falling further behind schedule, while in August a fire added to the many difficulties. Eventually it was signed off on 27 April – one day before its first test match, between local side Krylia Sovetov and Fakel Voronezh. It has been cut ridiculously fine and the surrounding infrastructure will hardly have had the most rigorous of workouts before its doors are opened for the World Cup.</p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong> Krylia (whose name, wonderfully, means “Wings of the Soviets”) will move there from their creaking Metallurg Stadium – which is itself worth a look if you can brave an iffy neighbourhood. They have been a yo-yo club recently but will be back in the top flight next season after a year away. It is an old club with rich tradition but, even so, it would take some turnaround for them to fill the ground. A residential development is expected to surround the new structure in good time.</p>    <h2>Mordovia Arena</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/saransk-zip/giv-3902bNxnQdzJSQu3/" data-alt="Mordovia Arena, Saransk"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/saransk-zip/giv-3902bNxnQdzJSQu3/">Mordovia Arena, Saransk</a> <figcaption>Mordovia Arena, Saransk</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>44,442</p> <p><strong>Completed: </strong>March 2018</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$300m</p> <p><strong>Games hosted at Russia 2018: </strong>Peru v Denmark, <em>16 June; </em>Colombia v Japan, <em>19 June; </em>Iran v Portugal, <em>25 June;</em> Panama v Tunisia, <em>28 June</em>.</p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>Saransk is the smallest of the World Cup host cities and, to Russians, was a surprising choice of venue – particularly when a football-loving city such as Krasnodar, to the south-west, will have an outstanding facility sitting idle. But Mordovia Arena, whose construction began in 2010, should serve its purpose well enough and is situated near enough to both railway station and newly completed airport for a swift getaway if supporters are seeking brighter lights.</p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong>There is nothing particularly flashy here although the stadium’s brightly coloured exterior, intended to reflect the rich palette of the Mordovia region’s arts and crafts, will hopefully be photogenic.</p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>Construction was considerably delayed – not least due to a lengthy suspension between 2013 and 2015 – so this proved to be another of the World Cup venues’ stragglers, although three test events in April involving local side Mordovia Saransk went off smoothly.</p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong>Capacity will be scaled back to around 28,000 and Mordovia will move in. They have a habit of moving between the top three divisions and are back in Russia’s second tier next season. When Syzran-2003 visited the new venue for its third warm-up fixture in mid-May, 41,057 fans came to see what the fuss was about; 11 days later 973 were in attendance when Mordovia finished their season with a match against Ural’s reserves at their old Start stadium. Make of that what you like; Saransk has never been a football-mad city and the commercial facilities inside the ground will probably be subject to a heavy sell, while other sports will be played on the site.</p>    <h2>Volgograd Arena</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/volgograd-zip/giv-3902IUqcMw6FMMck/" data-alt="Volgograd Arena"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/volgograd-zip/giv-3902IUqcMw6FMMck/">Volgograd Arena</a> <figcaption>Volgograd Arena</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Capacity: </strong>45,568<br></p> <p><strong>Completed: </strong>March 2018</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>$280m</p> <p><strong>Games hosted at Russia 2018: </strong>Tunisia v England, <em>18 June;</em> Nigeria v Iceland,<em> 22 June;</em> Saudi Arabia v Egypt, <em>25 June; </em>Japan v Poland, <em>28 June</em>.</p> <p><strong>History lesson </strong>The stadium is new, but the site can tell a tale or two. Here used to stand the Central Stadium, home to Rotor Volgograd and venue for the goalless first leg of their famous Uefa Cup win over Manchester United in 1995. That was a classic Soviet bowl; its replacement, where work began in 2015 after the old ground’s demolition, looks very different and its exterior design is intended to resemble basketwork.</p> <p><strong>Star attraction </strong>The finished article has a light, airy feel that should sit well with visitors; it will be worth a pilgrimage, too, for anyone wanting to remember one of the more enduring European shock results of the 1990s.</p>      <p><strong>Any hitches? </strong>A few minor issues. In June 2017 a small fire broke out on the site after a welding accident, and it had to be combed thoroughly for unexploded ordnance after bombs from the Battle of Stalingrad were found in 2014. Existing concerns about its location on a wetland area briefly raised their heads again in April when photographs purporting to show a crack in a concrete beam supporting the upper tier circulated online; a statement assuring the public of their safety was swiftly made.</p> <p><strong>Legacy </strong>Rotor expect to play here although, as with many of these venues’ tenants, their ability to get anywhere near filling the ground is in grave doubt. Last season they finished fourth-bottom of the second tier and although 24,000 watched one of the stadium’s test events against Krylia Sovetov in May it would probably take another visit from United to draw a full house again. The capacity will drop by around 10,000, which could help.</p> <p><strong>Editor: </strong>Jim Powell</p> <p><strong>Writer:</strong> Nick Ames</p> <p><strong>Graphics:</strong> Pablo Gutierrez</p> <p><strong>Photographs</strong> AFP, AP, Fifa, Getty Images and Reuters</p>
