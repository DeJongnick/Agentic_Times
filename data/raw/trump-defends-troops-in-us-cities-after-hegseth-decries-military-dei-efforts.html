<p>At an address of assembled generals and admirals, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, the US defense secretary, outlined changes to military policy and philosophy in a set of 10 directives meant to change organizational culture around fitness, race and gender, describing the previous state of military affairs as the “woke department”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> followed Hegseth’s call to embrace the virtues of lethality as a doctrine with a suggestion buried in an hour-long campaign-style speech that the gathering of officers and senior enlisted advisers should consider targeting US cities and civilian populations as a training exercise.</p> <p>“We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military – national guard, but military – because we’re going into Chicago very soon, that’s a big city with an incompetent governor,” Trump said, attacking JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor.</p> <p>Trump went on to describe soldiers he had seen in media accounts who had been spit upon who “want to knock the hell out of a person, but he’s not allowed to do anything … I say: ‘They spit, we hit’. Is that OK? I think so, they spit – it’s a new thing – ‘They spit, we hit’”. Trump said that immigration enforcement agents, facing people throwing bricks at their vehicles, should retaliate. “I say it here, you can get out of that car and you do whatever the hell you want to do”.</p> <p>He also defended the navy’s sinking of Venezuelan boats, rather than attempting to interdict suspected drug runners as required by international law and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. “Every boat kills about 25,000 people,” he claimed without evidence.</p> <p>Trump’s speech was packed with campaign references to his electoral victory and the perceived shortcomings of his political adversaries. The assemblage of uniformed officers sat stonefaced, expressionless and inscrutable with few smiles. Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden were met with silence. Some of his lines elicited polite ripples of laughter.</p> <p>In contrast, Hegseth’s address focused on military culture and philosophical doctrine. Decrying “the insane fallacy that diversity is our strength”, Hegseth said he had chosen to fire previous generals because they had been personally invested in progressive ideas about diversity.</p> <p>“It’s nearly impossible to change a culture with the same people helped create or even benefited from that culture,” he said, adding that he expects others to leave. “If the words that you hear today make your heart sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign.”</p> <p>Hegseth has fired several generals and admirals in the first months of his tenure, a disproportionate number of which have been Black or women, including chair of the joint chiefs, CQ Brown.</p> <p>“First of all, you’ve got to fire the chairman of the joint chiefs,” Hegseth said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoN5ovwB8s4&amp;t=1961s">during a November interview</a> on the Shawn Ryan Show. “Any general that was involved, general, admiral, or whatever, that was involved in any of that DEI woke shit has got to go.”</p> <p>The military does not have racial quotas for promotion, but does take steps to ensure that non-white and female troops do not face racial or gender discrimination. While noting that “being a racist has been illegal in our formations since 1948,” Hegseth said that the department would review promotions policies and eliminate racial quotas.</p> <p>“Colorblind, gender-neutral, merit based; the entire promotion process, including evaluations of warfighting capabilities, is being thoroughly re-examined,” he said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/us-military-leaders-meeting-pete-hegseth">US military brass brace for firings as Pentagon chief orders top-level meeting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hegseth said the Pentagon would overhaul inspector general and equal opportunity office rules to reduce complaints. He also said the Pentagon would establish a process to remove “forgivable earnest or minor infractions” from leader’s records. “I call it the no more walking on eggshells policy,” he said. “No more frivolous complaints … no more side tracking careers.”</p> <p>The gathering of flag officers together in the same place and time is largely unprecedented. Rather than record the equivalent of a Ted talk video or send an email, Hegseth chose to deliver a theatrically incendiary speech meant as much for a wider political audience as it was for men and women wearing stars on their shoulders. Hegseth took potshots at Mark Milley, the former chief of staff, and scattered jingoism throughout his address.</p> <p>“Should our enemies choose foolishly to challenge us, they will be crushed by the violence, precision and ferocity of the war department,” Hegseth said. “To our enemies, FAFO,” he said referring to the acronym for “fuck around and find out”.</p> <p>Hegseth used this gathering to impress the need for a risk-taking culture and a return to physical and appearance standards set in 1990. Permission to wear a beard – a shaving profile – will be broadly rescinded for everyone except special forces troops. Women in combat roles will be expected to meet the same physical standards as men.</p> <p>“War does not care if you are a man or a woman,” Hegseth said.</p> <p>Drill sergeants will be empowered to swear and conduct “shark attack” type-training, during which instructors gang up on a recruit and shout at them, Hegseth said. Basic training should be “scary, tough and disciplined. We’re empowering drill sergeants to instil healthy fear in new recruits.”</p> <p>Hegseth also said the rules of engagement would be reviewed. “We untie the hands of our war fighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt and kill the enemies of our country. No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement. Just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for war fighters.”</p> <p>Among his first acts as secretary, Hegseth <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/13/pete-hegseth-pentagon-lawyers-rules-of-war">fired</a> or reassigned many of the military lawyers who advise senior leaders about the legality of operations. He then commissioned his personal lawyer and former naval officer, Tim Parlatore, as a navy commander to oversee changes to legal advice to give commanders more leeway to pursue more aggressive tactics and take a more lenient approach in charging soldiers with battlefield crimes.</p> <p><em>David Smith contributed reporting</em></p>
