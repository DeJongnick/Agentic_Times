Thorne, its co-creator, has called on the government to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/18/adolescence-writer-jack-thorne-incel-culture-netflix">ban smartphones for under-16s</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/18/adolescence-writer-jack-thorne-incel-culture-netflix">‘The younger me would have sat up and nodded’: Adolescence writer Jack Thorne on the insidious appeal of incel culture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the show debuted, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has said she will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/20/uk-government-to-look-again-at-a-smartphone-ban-in-schools">scrutinise smartphone bans in schools in England</a>.

It’s abhorrent and we have to tackle it.”</p>
