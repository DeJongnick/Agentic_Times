<p>My friend Molly Bodinetz, who has died aged 46, was an inspiring clinical psychologist committed to working with young people at risk of going into care and custody, and their families.</p> <p>Time in the national and specialist adoption and fostering team at the Maudsley hospital in London in the 2000s led to Molly playing a key role in the success of early trials of a family-based intervention, Multisystemic Therapy (MST), in Hackney, London, starting in 2008. The subsequent implementation of MST across the UK resulted in increased school attendance and a reduction in offending rates.</p> <p>Born in London, to Sue (nee Evans), a costume designer, and Tony Bodinetz, an advertising copywriter, Molly went to James Allen’s girls’ school in Dulwich, and completed both undergraduate and doctoral training in clinical psychology at University College London.</p> <p>In 2016 she decided to fold up her Brompton and move out of London to be closer to the sea. She settled in Devon to bring up her young son, Esah.</p> <p>She joined Psychology Associates, a support agency based in Exeter, progressing to clinical lead for adoption and fostering, and became a member of the research committee of the Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy Institute.</p> <p>DDP’s focus on creating a safe and trusting relationship between a child and their caregiver resonated with Molly – giving families the message “we come in peace” and the idea that “if it was easy you’d already be doing it, so let us help you get back to the kind of family you want to be”.</p> <p>In April 2021, Molly joined Bridges at Devon county council, as the senior clinical psychologist and clinical lead. She helped develop the Bridges model that guides practitioners working to prevent family breakdown and young people from entering care. The Bridges team was named team of the year for children’s services in the 2023 Social Worker of the Year awards.</p> <p>Molly’s encounter with cancer was sudden and swift, but afforded her enough time for reunions with family and friends, to dance, drink tea and reflect while waves thrashed loudly on her favourite stretch of Dawlish coastline.</p> <p>Her legacy of compassion and empathy, and superb taste in Adidas sportswear, will be remembered by those fortunate enough to have known her.</p> <p>She is survived by Esah, by her siblings, Gemma, Jack, Noah, Zoe, Gabe, Nat and Elijah, and by Sue.</p>
