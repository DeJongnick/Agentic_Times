<p>A new scholarship programme commemorating the memory of Stephen Lawrence is to be funded by the Football Foundation, with the aim of supporting black students from low socioeconomic backgrounds to train as architects and help develop more inclusive infrastructure for the national game.</p> <p>The Stephen Lawrence Scholarship has been developed in conjunction with Greenwich University and will see one student each academic year provided with a fee waiver for the establishment’s MArch Architecture programme. The recipient of the scholarship will also work with the Football Foundation outside their studies.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/02/jordon-ibe-interview-liverpool-football">‘Everything came so quick’: Jordon Ibe on Liverpool, trauma and starting afresh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stephen Lawrence aspired to become an architect before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/27/stephen-lawrence-murder-forgive-killers-but-not-metropolitan-police">he was murdered in a racist attack</a> in the south London neighbourhood of Eltham in 1993 at the age of 18. He was also a keen Manchester United supporter and his mother, Doreen Lawrence, said the scholarship would be a “meaningful continuation” of his legacy.</p> <p>“Through the Stephen Lawrence Scholarship, Stephen’s legacy will continue to inspire and empower future generations, ensuring that his vision for equality, opportunity and justice lives on,” said Lady Lawrence, who holds an honorary doctorate at the university. “[It] will provide opportunities for the next generation and reinforce the vital role that education and sport can play in transforming communities.”</p> <p>The Football Foundation works to improve grassroots facilities in the sport, with an emphasis on “where the need is greatest and the greatest impact will be made”. It is funded by the Premier League, Football Association and UK government. Robert Sullivan, the organisation’s chief executive, said the scholarship would form part of its work to lower barriers to entry in the sport. “This initiative is the perfect legacy as we work to plan, design and construct facilities that target and support groups and communities who have faced barriers in terms of participation,” Sullivan said. “This includes lower socioeconomic groups and culturally and ethnically diverse communities. These facilities provide not only a great place to play but also a safe space for communities to come together, where people can meet and build friendships.”</p>    <p>A lack of representation for black and minority ethnic people within football continues to be an issue for the game. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/19/black-footballers-come-together-to-demand-fair-leadership-opportunities">data recorded by the Black Footballers Partnership</a> found that 43% of players in the Premier League were black but only 4.4% of former players were in managerial roles in England. Meanwhile, only 1.6% of executive and leadership roles at men’s clubs were held by black people.</p> <p>Paul Elliott, the vice-chair of Charlton, which sits in the borough of Greenwich, helped to broker the scholarship deal. A long-term activist for racial equality in football, the former Celtic and Chelsea defender said: “This partnership between the University of Greenwich and the Football Foundation is a powerful example of what can be achieved when shared values and vision come together.</p> <p>“It has been a personal honour to help bring these organisations together in Stephen Lawrence’s name – uniting his passion for football with our collective commitment to creating inspiring spaces and life-changing opportunities for young people. Through the Stephen Lawrence Scholarship, we not only honour his legacy, but actively build on it, empowering a new generation.”</p>
