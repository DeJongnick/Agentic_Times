<p>Paramount has struck a $7.7bn (£5.7bn) deal to become the exclusive US broadcaster of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, just days after its controversial merger with Skydance Media.</p> <p>Under the seven-year deal with the sports group’s parent company, TKO Group, all 13 of UFC’s marquee numbered events and 30 Fight Nights a year will be streamed on the Paramount+ service, with a selected number also simulcast on CBS, from next year.</p> <p>The agreement will mean the end of UFC’s current pay-per-view model on the Disney-owned ESPN+ service.</p> <p>The deal comes a week after David Ellison took over as chair and chief executive following Skydance’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/paramount-skydance-merger-fcc">$8.4bn takeover of the Hollywood studio</a> and broadcasting business, with the media company saying it may pursue UFC rights in other markets as they come up for renewal.</p> <p>“Live sports continue to be a cornerstone of our broader strategy,” said Ellison. “[It drives] engagement, subscriber growth and long-term loyalty. The addition of UFC’s year-round must-watch events to our platforms is a major win.”</p> <p>Paramount is paying $1.1bn on average annually to TKO Group for the rights and will offer all the matches at no additional cost to consumers.</p> <p>Mark Shapiro, president and chief operating officer at TKO, said: “Paramount is a platinum partner with significant reach. Our new agreement unlocks powerful opportunities at TKO for years to come.”</p> <p>UFC is led by Dana White, an ally of the US president, Donald Trump, who spoke at his victory rally in Washington DC in January. He is also a board member of Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram.</p> <p>Ellison, the 42-year-old son of the multibillionaire co-founder of Oracle, Larry Ellison, is working with Paramount’s other co-owner, RedBird Capital, to cut $2bn in costs from the business.</p> <p>RedBird, which is run by Gerry Cardinale, is also in the process of pushing through a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/22/telegraph-sale-poised-to-go-ahead-after-lords-foreign-ownership-vote">£500m takeover of the Telegraph</a>.</p> <p>The rights deal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/paramount-skydance-merger-fcc">follows completion of the protracted merger</a> of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a process which drew regulatory and political scrutiny and raised concerns among some investors.</p> <p>Last month Paramount Global agreed to pay <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/02/paramount-settles-with-trump-for-16m-over-60-minutes-interview-with-kamala-harris">$16m to settle a legal dispute with Trump</a> over what the president claimed was misleading editing of a pre-election interview on its CBS News network with the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris.</p> <p>While CBS initially called the lawsuit “completely without merit”, its parent company decided to settle.</p> <p>CBS also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/18/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-to-end-in-2026-as-cbs-cancels-show">cancelled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a> days after the eponymous host said the settlement by the network’s parent company was a “bribe”.</p> <p>Paramount owns assets including MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Showtime and Channel 5 in the UK. The film studio has produced Hollywood blockbusters including Top Gun: Maverick, as well as the Mission: Impossible and Star Trek franchises.</p>
