<p>The Oxford Union has “unequivocally” condemned comments apparently made by its president-elect about the fatal shooting of the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk in the US.</p> <p>Kirk, 31, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-maps-videos-images">killed at a Utah Valley University show</a> on Wednesday in what authorities have called a political assassination.</p> <p>George Abaraonye, who became president-elect of the debating society after a vote in June, posted comments in a WhatsApp group after his death, according to the Daily Telegraph.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-police-search-for-suspect-amid-condemnation-of-targeted-killing">Charlie Kirk shooting: FBI releases images of person of interest and offers $100,000 reward</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One message was reported to have said “Charlie Kirk got shot, let’s fucking go”, while another thought to have been posted on Abaraonye’s Instagram account read “Charlie Kirk got shot loool”.</p> <p>In a statement on Thursday, the Oxford Union criticised the student’s comments and said it “firmly opposes all forms of political violence and strongly stands by our commitment to free speech and considerate debate”.</p> <p>“The Oxford Union would like to unequivocally condemn the reported words and sentiments expressed by its president-elect, George Abaraonye, with regards to the passing of Charlie Kirk,” the society wrote on X. “His reported views do not represent the Oxford Union’s current leadership or committee’s view.</p> <p>“The current administration has, under president Moosa Harraj, no association with and is entirely independent from Mr Abaraonye’s administration.”</p> <p>The statement added: “We would like to reiterate that our condolences lie with Charlie Kirk’s family, especially his wife and young children, who are enduring such terrible grief.”</p> <p>In response, Abaraonye said he had “reacted impulsively” to the news of Kirk’s shooting, and that the comments were “quickly deleted” after news emerged of his death.</p> <p>“Those words did not reflect my values,” Abaraonye added. “Nobody deserves to be the victim of political violence … I extend my condolences to his family and loved ones.</p> <p>“At the same time, my reaction was shaped by the context of Mr Kirk’s own rhetoric – words that often dismissed or mocked the suffering of others. He described the deaths of American children from school shootings as an acceptable ‘cost’ of protecting gun rights. He justified the killing of civilians in Gaza, including women and children, by blaming them collectively for Hamas. He called for the retraction of the Civil Rights Act, and repeatedly spread harmful stereotypes about LGBTQ and trans communities. These were horrific and dehumanising statements.”</p> <p>Kirk and Abaraonye had met during a debate on toxic masculinity held by the Oxford Union in May, the Telegraph reported. Donald Trump, the US president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2025/sep/10/trump-blames-radical-left-political-violence-for-killing-of-charlie-kirk-video">paid tribute to Kirk</a> as a “martyr for truth and freedom” after the shooting.</p>
