<p>Frances Ryan’s article rings familiar bells (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/20/private-healthcare-nhs-young-people">Young people want to ‘go private’ – I’m a lifelong supporter of the NHS, but I can see why, 20 August</a>). I&nbsp;have been waiting 60 weeks for a partial knee replacement. The hospital website and the NHS website say “average patient waiting time 18 weeks”.</p> <p>However, at every stage my wait has been beset by avoidable delays: two cancelled appointments rescheduled months later, three months’ delay reviewing the MRI scan, referral from one consultant to another – a “new referral” – and a 12-week wait. After my first pre-op, failure to follow up on outstanding investigations necessitated a second pre-op, after which the clearance for surgery was not communicated to admissions until I pursued it, four weeks later.</p> <p>The current message is that they “will try to give me a date within eight weeks”. A complaint to the Patient Relations Service elicited the explanation: “That’s just the way we do things.” Meanwhile, formal complaints elicit long-delayed responses full of nonsensical obfuscation. If the Department of Health and Social Care is relying on waiting-list information from hospital trusts like this, then plans for NHS reform are doomed to fail.</p> <p>I could have had my surgery privately at the same NHS hospital, with the same consultant, within weeks of referral. If I’d gone private 14&nbsp;months ago, I’d probably have been able to enjoy 2025 – mobile, and drug and pain-free. Perhaps I’ll&nbsp;go private next time?<br><strong>Ed Mason</strong><br><em>Kendal, Cumbria</em></p> <p>• Unlike Frances Ryan, I am fortunate to have never faced the dilemma of needing to use private healthcare because of the apparent failings of the NHS. But despite her personal circumstances I think she might reflect on the fact that individual patients buying care does have a wider impact upon other patients who may have greater clinical needs.</p> <p>The private physiotherapist she used may have been wholly independent, but the overwhelming majority of clinicians working in private healthcare also work part-time in the NHS. The fact that they are moonlighting, treating those choosing to pay, directly contributes to what Ryan&nbsp;describes&nbsp;as the NHS’s “sky‑high” waiting lists.</p> <p>In what is now very much a our “me first” society, it is swimming against the tide to refer to the common good. But accessing private healthcare is anything but a neutral act. It significantly worsens the prospects of those who are unable, or unwilling, to take this step, whose health problems are often considerably worse than those of the queue-jumpers.<br><strong>David Hinchliffe</strong><br><em>Holmfirth, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
