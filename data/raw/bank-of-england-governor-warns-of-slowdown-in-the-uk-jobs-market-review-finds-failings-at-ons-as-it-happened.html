But the rest of the decade looks bleak, with typical household incomes set to grow by just 1 per cent over the next five years.</p> <p>“There are winners and losers within this weak outlook, with pensioner incomes set to grow by a healthy 5 per cent over the rest of the decade, while the poorest half of the population are set to see their incomes fall.</p> <p>“But a stronger economy and the right policy interventions can brighten this outlook. Maintaining strong wage growth and returning to pre-pandemic employment levels would make middle-income Britain far better off, while ending the two-child limit can lift living standards for poorer families.”</p> </blockquote>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/resfoundation/status/1938137794032934956">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨 Latest Living Standards Outlook🚨<br><br>How have incomes have fared over the decade so far, and what may lie ahead given current economic forecasts and the Government’s tax and benefit policies?<br><br>And how could targeted policy changes could improve the outlook for the poorest.… <a href="https://t.co/verZhvgVw2">pic.twitter.com/verZhvgVw2</a></p>&mdash; Resolution Foundation (@resfoundation) <a href="https://twitter.com/resfoundation/status/1938137794032934956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2025</a></blockquote>   </figure> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685cf5908f083e0626a9e1f7" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-26T07:25:51.688Z">8.25am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">FTSE 100 opens slightly higher</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>There’s a calm feeling to trading in the City this morning, with the market slightly higher.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE 100 index has risen by 6 points, or 0.07%, in early trading to 8725 points, led by gambling firm <strong>Entain</strong> (+2.3%) and mining company <strong>Anglo</strong> <strong>American</strong> (+1.8%).</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> (+0.1%) and <strong>Shell</strong> (+0.17%) are both slightly higher.</p> <p><strong>Derren Nathan, </strong>head of equity research at<strong> Hargreaves Lansdown, </strong>says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“<strong>Shell</strong> has denied media speculation of early talks to buy rival <strong>BP</strong>.
