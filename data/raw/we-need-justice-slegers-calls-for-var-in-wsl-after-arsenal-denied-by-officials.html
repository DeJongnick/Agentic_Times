<p>Renée Slegers said teams in the Women’s Super League “need just decisions” and called for video assistant referees and the use of technology after two controversial disallowed goals were among officiating talking points in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/08/arsenal-chelsea-wsl-match-report">Arsenal’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea</a>.</p> <p>“In a game like this we need just decisions. We need justice. That’s where I think VAR and technology can come in,” said the Arsenal manager. “There’s more and more at stake in the WSL, at the top but also in the relegation battle and everywhere in between. We have to look at how we grow the game in all aspects.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/08/arsenal-chelsea-wsl-match-report">Alessia Russo earns draw with Chelsea but Arsenal rue controversial calls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sonia Bompastor echoed the plea of her counterpart. “I think bringing technology into the women’s game would be probably the best call we can make,” the Chelsea manager said.</p> <p>Stina Blackstenius’s disallowed goal in the 53rd minute led to confusion, with a slight delay before the referee made the decision to rule it out for handball. Replays showed the ball had hit the Swedish forward’s hip and not her hand. The corner that led to the goal should have been a goal-kick, but once it was given the goal should have stood.</p> <p>“I had no idea,” said Slegers. “The goal is scored, no one is calling for it, the players are celebrating, the stadium goes crazy, it’s a fantastic moment. Then, all of a sudden, I turned around and saw somebody saying the goal was disallowed so I was very surprised.”</p>    <p>Alessia Russo’s goal with three minutes remaining earned Arsenal a draw, though replays showed she may have been offside. The Gunners believed they had grabbed an added-time winner soon after, but Frida Maanum was flagged offside, in another marginal call that highlighted the need for VAR.</p> <p>Speaking on Sky Sports, the former England international Izzy Christiansen called the two decisions “absolutely abysmal” and lamented the impact on Arsenal’s title challenge. “It’s cost them. There’s no other way to put it, they have been robbed.”</p> <p>Bompastor said she could understand Arsenal’s frustrations. “It’s difficult to make comments on it because from the dugout you can’t see the same as they can see on the pitch,” she said. “I probably can understand that Arsenal feel a little frustrated, but I don’t want to make any comments. I’m not the referee and I was too far away to make a really good comment. I haven’t watched the game again yet.” </p>
