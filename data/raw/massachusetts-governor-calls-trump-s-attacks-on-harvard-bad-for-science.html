<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> governor Maura Healey said on Sunday that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s attacks on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/harvard-university">Harvard University</a> and other schools are having detrimental ripple effects, with the shutdown of research labs and cuts to hospitals linked to colleges.</p> <p>During an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation, the Democratic governor said that the effects on Harvard are damaging “American competitiveness”, since a number of researchers are leaving the US for opportunities in other countries. After decades of investment in science and innovation, she said: “intellectual assets are being given away.”</p> <p>In the past week, the US president cut off <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/31/trump-harvard-funding-review">billions of dollars to Harvard</a> in federal funds, after the university <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/14/harvard-university-trump-administration">refused to concede</a> to a number of the administration’s demands. Trump also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/trump-harvard-irs-tax-status">called for its tax-exempt status to be revoked</a>, a potentially illegal move, against the world-famous college in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/20/harvard-trump-conservative-history-academia">The Trump-Harvard showdown is the latest front in a long conservative war against academia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of the moves against colleges, Healey said: “It’s bad for patients, it’s bad for science, and it’s really bad for American competitiveness. There’s no way a state can make up for the cuts from federal funding.”</p> <p>She added: “I was in a hospital recently, Boston Children’s, where some of the sickest kids in the country receive care. Cuts to Boston Children’s and other hospitals are a direct result of Donald Trump’s actions, as these are part of a teaching hospital system.</p> <p>“These cuts to universities have significant ripple effects, resulting in layoffs of scientists and doctors, and clinical trials for cancer treatments have been shut down.</p> <p>“As governor, I want Massachusetts and America to soar. What Donald Trump is doing is essentially inviting other countries, like China, to take our scientists and researchers. This is terrible, especially considering what he has done to the economy. I am working hard every day to lower costs in my state, cut taxes, and build more housing, while Donald Trump is making life more expensive and harder for all of us.”</p> <p>Since Trump took office, his administration has deployed an “antisemitism taskforce” to demand various policy changes at different universities around the country.</p> <p>Columbia University, one of the first institutions targeted by the taskforce, quickly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/columbia-university-funding-trump-demands">caved to the Trump administration’s demands</a> to restore <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/trump-administration-cancels-columbia-university-funding">$400m in federal funding</a>. Some of the measures that Columbia conceded to included banning face masks on campus, empowering security officers to arrest people, and placing control of the Middle Eastern department under a new senior vice-provost.</p> <p>Former Columbia University president Lee Bollinger said on Sunday that the Trump administration’s attacks on academic institutions represent a significant attack on first amendment rights.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/19/harvard-trump-administration-timeline">The showdown between Harvard and the White House – day by day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This is a kind of weaponization of the government’s power,” Bolinger said on CNN, adding that it “seems like a campaign of intimidation”.</p> <p>“This is a kind of weaponization of the government’s power,” he said.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the federal government sent Harvard two separate letters with specific demands. After the university publicly rejected those demands, the administration quickly froze nearly $2.3bn in federal funding.</p> <p>The conflict between the administration and the elite university took a strange turn on Friday, with the New York Times reporting that an 11 April letter from the administration with additional demands – which escalated the showdown – was “unauthorized”. The university disputed that the letter was “unauthorized,” claiming the federal government has “doubled down” on its offensive.</p>
