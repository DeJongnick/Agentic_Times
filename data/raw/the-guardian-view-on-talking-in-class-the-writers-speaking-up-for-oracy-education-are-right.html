<h1>The Guardian view on talking in class: the writers speaking up for oracy education are right </h1>

<p>Two years ago, Sir Keir Starmer enthused about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/07/labour-oracy-plan-children-speaking-skills-england-schools">teaching speaking skills</a>. So schools campaigners were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/23/keir-starmer-urged-to-honour-pledge-to-embed-speaking-skills-in-englands-schools">understandably dismayed</a> when oracy – otherwise known as speaking and listening – did not appear in the interim report of the curriculum review for England headed by Prof Becky Francis. Peter Hyman, the former New Labour adviser who became a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/sep/01/free-school-21-stratford-peter-hyman">headteacher</a>, has been a key figure behind the revival, over the past decade, of an idea <a href="https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/Images/661428-education-brief-oracy-.pdf">developed in the 1960s</a>.</p> <p>Steps to embed the importance of verbal communication in education have already been taken, with more than 1,000 schools working with <a href="https://voice21.org/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=16884202503&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACn8iZBWYYtvXTyBHwtHrLEGQp7_E&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1ozEBhAdEiwAn9qbzSB4kSI8qFVhCRHwCLlD35ii2NuddRPZaFadntrYNX2GaoKCFzQBERoCL68QAvD_BwE">the charity Voice 21</a>, and a parallel project in <a href="https://www.thewoodfoundation.org.uk/excelerate-oracy-practitioner-training/">Scotland</a>. The hope expressed by children’s authors and others last week is that its absence from the draft report was an oversight which will soon be rectified. The task before Prof Francis’s commission is a daunting one, with reformers&nbsp;of all kinds looking to it for solutions. An evidence call attracted 7,000 responses, with the future of special educational needs provision, and a wish to reduce exams, among key issues raised.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/01/oracy-already-exists-in-schools-just-look-inside-the-drama-studio">Oracy already exists in schools. Just look inside the drama studio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it should be clear to the panel, and to ministers,&nbsp;that oral learning also matters. One reason is the rising number of children arriving in primary school with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/oct/08/school-starters-pandemic-lack-communication-skills-ofsted">speech and language skills</a> below the expected level. While some pupils catch up later, others need specialist help. Communication difficulties are one reason for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/06/government-faces-battle-over-send-overhaul-as-campaigners-voice-fears">the increase</a> in the number of education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which set out what such support entails. The reasons for such complex changes are not yet fully understood, although the pandemic has had an impact.</p> <p>The challenge of artificial intelligence, in relation to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jun/15/thousands-of-uk-university-students-caught-cheating-using-ai-artificial-intelligence-survey">university studies</a> as well as schools, is another factor behind&nbsp;a&nbsp;renewed emphasis on talking. Given the easy availability of technological tools to aid writing, it is arguably more important than ever that&nbsp;people are equipped to share ideas and knowledge through speech as well. In many European countries oral examinations are <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/07/21/do-children-in-england-talk-too-little">far more common</a>, in schools as well as universities, whereas in the UK “vivas” are mostly reserved for&nbsp;postgraduate studies.</p> <p>In foreign language learning, the importance of speaking is taken for granted. But while oracy already features in the maths and science curriculum, as well as in English, it is often marginalised. The tricky task of reformers is to alter teaching practice so that more weight is placed on verbal communication, without making this yet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/06/pupils-showing-high-anxiety-run-up-gcses-a-levels-teachers-say">another assessment hurdle</a> to be cleared.</p> <p>For its champions, the core of oracy education is&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/24/schools-oracy-debating-failing-generation-teaching-public-speaking">ability to make connections</a>. They want young&nbsp;people to be able to express themselves, and&nbsp;point out that this is a vital life skill – for example, in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/13/graduates-teach-first-in-person-interviews-ai">job interviews</a> and the kinds of public‑facing work that seem least likely to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/13/could-ai-be-accelerating-slowdown-in-the-uk-job-market">taken&nbsp;over by machines</a> – for which school should prepare them. Big gaps in confidence about public speaking have long been recognised among the most glaring social inequalities.</p> <p>This doesn’t mean that everyone should aspire to be a debating champion. Different accents, personalities and ways of relating should be valued, not ironed out. But if our schools are to keep pace with our frenetically changing world, it is surely right that they should maximise the facility for language, which is part of what makes us human.</p>
