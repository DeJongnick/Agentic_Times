<h1>My cultural awakening: an ancient statue made me fall in love with my fat body</h1>
<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-08-24T06:00:23Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Anonymous; as told to Kate Pasola &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Culture</div>
<p>I still remember the moment my body image issues began&nbsp;as if it were yesterday. The shaming came before the&nbsp;bingeing: I was 18 and my mum&nbsp;told me I needed to start&nbsp;being careful with my eating, because I was “getting fat”. </p> <p>She would say: “You’d be so pretty if&nbsp;you’d just lose weight!” I wasn’t overweight at the time, and I felt so&nbsp;angry. But young women aren’t allowed to be angry – so, with nowhere&nbsp;to put those feelings, I channelled them into food, spiralling into binge-eating as an&nbsp;act of revenge. Then came&nbsp;remorse and shame: a cycle of bingeing and restriction.</p> <p>By 25, I was attending Overeaters Anonymous, but it didn’t help. Over the space of the next two decades, I&nbsp;tried every diet – the “cabbage soup diet”, Slimming World, Weight Watchers, SlimFast, Atkins, low-carb, intermittent fasting. My weight fluctuated as I had two children – I just thought of myself as a blob. I’d tried to tentatively engage with the body positivity movement, but it was hard.</p> <p>Then, in October 2021, at the age of&nbsp;42, I took my seven-year-old son Arthur to the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, a couple of hours from where we live in Gloucestershire. The day out was more for Arthur than me. He wasn’t sleeping well at the time, so I was stressed and exhausted.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>My eyes fell on to her wonderful chubby bottom, her arms draped over her big breasts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But as I ascended the stairs up to the&nbsp;first floor, I&nbsp;spotted her. This tiny limestone carving, only 11cm tall: a&nbsp;replica of the&nbsp;Paleolithic Venus of&nbsp;Willendorf figurine. I was immediately transfixed.</p> <p>She is, by modern standards, either&nbsp;pregnant or could be described&nbsp;as obese. My eyes fell on to&nbsp;her wonderful chubby bottom, her&nbsp;arms&nbsp;draped over her big breasts. There’s a fat, pouchy bit above her vulva. A lovely protruding belly, with&nbsp;a&nbsp;belly button that looks just like&nbsp;mine.</p> <p>I felt intense joy, and immediate relief at&nbsp;this proof that humans come in&nbsp;all shapes and sizes, and always have have, as well as relief from the neverending shame that a fat person carries around. This&nbsp;woman’s body was worshipped,&nbsp;revered or even sexualised. For&nbsp;some reason, somebody had&nbsp;bothered to make her. I&nbsp;stared at&nbsp;her while my husband and son wandered off to the cafe, and stole another look on the way out. Seeing my&nbsp;own body mirrored back at me by this figurine from 30,000 years ago wiped the slate&nbsp;clean of all I’d been taught, all those painful beliefs. I&nbsp;realised I&nbsp;deserved to be free.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/09/my-cultural-awakening-steve-carell-way-way-back-film-domestic-abuse">My cultural awakening: a Steve Carell film made me realise I was being abused</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From that moment on, I tried to reject diet culture. I felt immediately uplifted. I started doing things I was too nervous to do in the past, such as wearing a bikini or sleeveless dresses on a hot day. Wild swimming without worrying about what anyone thought. I used to scroll on my phone, comparing myself to other women, but now I’ve deleted my social media. I’ve stopped bingeing. No more revenge eating. Of course, I’m&nbsp;still going to order a takeaway when I want to, but eating is&nbsp;no longer self-harm.</p> <p>I’m even planning something bonkers that I’d never have dreamed of doing: performance art inspired by the Venus of Willendorf. After seeing her, I&nbsp;enrolled in an MA course in art&nbsp;education at Oxford Brookes University. For my thesis, which is about the links between knitting and neurodivergence, I’m knitting the details of her body, from her vulva to&nbsp;her head-beading, on to a nude, skin-tight elastic bodysuit. I’ll wear it&nbsp;in the museum and photograph myself next to her. A lifesize Venus of&nbsp;Willendorf.</p> <p>These days, I’m happily fat. I’m not impervious to diet culture – something will always come along and rock me. But I’m going to find a silver charm of&nbsp;the Venus of Willendorf to wear: a&nbsp;talisman to always bring me back to&nbsp;myself.</p> <p><em>In the UK, <a href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/">Beat</a> can be contacted on 0808-801-0677.
