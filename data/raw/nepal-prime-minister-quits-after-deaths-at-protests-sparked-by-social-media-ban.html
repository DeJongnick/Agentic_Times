<p>Nepal’s prime minister has resigned after some of the worst unrest in decades rocked the country this week, set off by a ban on social media and discontent at political corruption and nepotism.</p> 
<p>KP Sharma Oli’s resignation came a day after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/08/nepal-bans-26-social-media-sites-including-x-whatsapp-and-youtube">widespread protests were met with deadly force</a> by police, leaving 19 dead and hundreds injured. The spark for the protests was a government ban on 26 prominent social media apps, but escalated into a larger mass movement against corruption among political elites.</p> 
<p>The government decision to roll back the ban on sites such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and X on Monday night did nothing to quell the anger among young people, who continued what was called the “Gen Z” protests.</p>

<p>In defiance of curfews, protests continued to erupt across the country on Tuesday and thousands stormed the federal parliament building in Kathmandu and set it alight. Fires burned across the streets of the capital, turning the sky black with smoke, and riot police were pelted with stones.</p> 
<p>The country’s political leaders were evacuated to safe locations, as anger at the government swelled on the streets, and Kathmandu airport was closed down.</p> 
<p>As calls for the resignation of Oli grew on Tuesday, his home was set on fire. Homes of the president and other prominent ministers were also attacked as Gen Z protesters took control of the country’s main administrative area, Singha Durbar.</p> 
<p>By early Tuesday afternoon Oli had submitted his resignation letter to the president , an announcement which was met with cheers by protesters who were gathered around the parliament building, and Nepal’s president, Ram Chandra Paudel. The home minister had already resigned on Monday night over the killing of protesters.</p> 
<p>Chaos continued in the streets even after Oli’s resignation and by Tuesday night, Nepal’s army chief confirmed that army troops were to be deployed on the streets from 10pm to maintain order. “Some groups are taking undue advantage of the extraordinary circumstances to cause extensive damage to ordinary citizens and public property,” said the army in a statement.</p> 
<p>Rohan Ansari, 20, said he had seen his friend shot dead by police before his eyes on Monday as they protested in the streets of Kathmandu. “But today, the Gen Z movement has succeeded,” he said, standing outside the stormed parliament building, which billowed with thick black smoke. “Now, his soul will rest in peace. From now on, the work will be led by the youth. The files of their corruption will be exposed.”</p> 
<p>Oli, 73, is seen as a veteran of Nepali politics and began his fourth term last year after his Communist party forged a coalition government with the centre-left Nepali Congress. In his letter, Oli said he had resigned in order to “facilitate a solution to the problem and help resolve it politically”. In the aftermath of Oli’s resignation, Nepal’s president, Ram Chandra Paudel, invited Gen Z protest leaders for talks.</p> 
<p>Dissatisfaction, particularly among the younger generation, has grown as Nepal has been crippled by political instability, corruption and slow economic development, with swathes of the population forced to travel abroad to find work.</p> 
<p>A string of high-profile corruption cases among senior political figures has dominated headlines and social media has been awash with images of the luxury spending habits of the children of the country’s political elites, fuelling resentment as ordinary Nepalis face economic hardship and and unemployment.</p> 
<p>Naresh Rawal, 27, said the protests had been the only way to force change. “Corruption has gone so far that leaders have accumulated Land Rovers, bullets and millions of rupees in their homes,” said Rawal.</p> 
<p>“They don’t drink regular water, they have cartons of imported water. Where does all that luxury come from? Where did this wealth come from? Where did their children get money for lavish trips every month? This is why this was necessary action. Now the country can move forward on the path of reform.”</p> 
<p>Tanuja Pandey, 24, was among those who called for Oli and his ministers to face a criminal investigation for the deadly use of force against protesters. “This is not just a death of 19 youths – it is murder,” she said. “The government’s hands are stained with blood. The government cannot escape accountability this time.”</p> 
<p>The government said on Monday it had formed a committee to investigate the violence and would pay compensation to the families of the dead and provide free treatment for injured people.</p> 
<p>Amnesty International said live ammunition had been used against protesters on Monday, and the United Nations demanded a swift and transparent inquiry.</p> 
<p>The ban on social media came after Nepal’s government gave social media firms a seven-day deadline to register and comply with new regulations. All but five failed to register on time and as a result Meta’s Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Alphabet’s YouTube, China’s Tencent and Snapchat, Pinterest and X were blocked by midnight on Thursday.</p> 
<p>The government’s decision caused outrage among Nepal’s youth, many who saw it as an attempt to suppress their criticism of the government.</p> 
<p>“The corruption that has permeated every level of the country must end,” said Raksha Bam, 26<strong>. “</strong>But instead of stopping that corruption, they shut down the civic space of our generation. That is why Gen Z gathered in one place.”</p> 
<p>Many of those on the streets said it was time that politicians represented the needs of the younger generation. “Our movement will not remain limited to this,” said protester Khem Neupane, 31.<strong> “</strong>We will not let this energy and courage die in vain.”</p>
