<p>Last winter, 93-year-old Ernest Towers had access to arguably one of the most transformational tools in healthcare, when his North Yorkshire care home, Sutton Lodge, was linked to <a href="http://www.airedale-trust.nhs.uk" title="">Airedale NHS foundation trust's</a> telemedicine service.</p> <p>For many older people, unplanned admissions to emergency departments – or even routine hospital appointments – can be hugely disruptive. The link to Airedale's telehealth hub, staffed by nurses experienced in acute assessment, provides Towers with on call specialised medical care around the clock, albeit via video link.</p> <p>Rachel Binks, nurse consultant for outreach and critical care at the trust, argues that high definition cameras and screens, linked by the NHS's N3 network, provide a very clear view of the patient. "We can see whether they are having a problem, say with their breathing, and we can use other equipment like telemonitoring to assess them," she says.</p> <p>Airedale provides telemedicine to 107 nursing and residential homes, and this year it is expanding its service with links to a further 180. It has also kitted out 75 patients in their own homes, typically people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure.</p> <p>According to the trust's figures, in the 12 months from April 2012 telemedicine reduced hospital admissions by 35%, A&amp;E attendances by 53% and bed days by 59% for people in nursing and residential care homes. The findings for people with long-term conditions are similar: 45% fewer hospital admissions, a 60% reduction in A&amp;E attendances and a 50% cut in bed days.</p> <p>And it claims that feedback from patients and carers is positive. Michael Hebden, manager of Sutton Lodge, says: "We can always call if we have doubts or queries about our residents. We've used it for advice on breathing complaints, a head injury, rashes and chest infections."</p> <p>The service reaches across England, as far south as Dartford and as north as Carlisle, and has come a long way since it started eight years ago with a very different type of clientele. Airdale's medical director at the time, Dr Richard Pope, saw telemedicine as a way of tackling health inequalities and treating hard to reach patients. Pope was instrumental in initiating videoconferencing consultations with prisoners at Full Sutton maximum security jail.</p> <p>Rebecca Malin, Airdale's deputy director of strategy and business development, says: "In those early days, because we were only delivering the service to a handful of prisoners, it brought about scheduling issues. Five prisons doesn't generate enough referrals to run a full clinic."</p> <p>Airedale now provides a remote consultant-led service, including full trauma, orthopaedic and dermatology clinics, to 15 prisons, including Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire which started making referrals in April 2014.</p> <p>The capital outlay for technology is funded by local area teams, created in April 2013 by NHS England with responsibility for contracting and delivering services for prisoners. Malin points out that the reduction in escort and bed watch costs is significant. "The minimum cost for an escort is £200 and there is really no upper limit if you have a high security prisoner. And if they are super high security, then you are into helicopters and guards."</p> <p>She says about 50% fewer prisoners have to be escorted to hospital as a result of telemedicine and that the benefits go beyond cost savings. "If you are a patient in the waiting room it is disruptive to see someone coming in under guard.</p> <p>"And then there is the privacy and dignity of prisoners, not being paraded through an outpatient department in handcuffs."</p> <p>Delivering remote care successfully relies on a resilient technical infrastructure, preferably backed up by e-patient records. Malin says that despite the reliance on broadband, there has only been one instance of a care home where connectivity was too poor to run the service.</p> <p>A next step for Airedale is to provide telehealth for end of life care. Following pilots, it is rolling out 30 telemedicine units, which will go into the homes of people in the last few months of life.</p> <p>Malin says the trust did not initially set out to provide telemedicine for end of life patients, but feedback from the pilots has been very positive. One woman said it gave her the confidence to deliver her promise of caring for her husband and allowing him to die in his own home.</p> <p><strong>Are you a member of our online community? </strong><a href="https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/" title=""><strong>Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>
