<p>Donald Trump’s nominee to lead a federal watchdog agency, Paul Ingrassia, withdrew on Tuesday following a report that Ingrassia described himself as having a “Nazi streak.”</p> <p>Ingrassia said in a social media post that he was pulling out of a scheduled Thursday hearing before a Senate panel that was set to consider his nomination because “I do not have enough Republican votes at this time.”</p> <p>The post came after Senate majority leader John Thune on Monday called for the White House to pull the nomination. Thune’s remarks marked a rare sign of opposition in a Republican-controlled Senate that has shown little interest in challenging Trump’s nominees and his agenda.</p>  <h2>Trump nominee to lead whistleblower office drops out after racist texts surface</h2>  <p>Ingrassia, currently a White House liaison at the Department of Homeland Security, was the subject of a report on Monday <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/20/paul-ingrassia-racist-text-messages-nazi-00613608">published in Politico</a>. The report featured text messages where he allegedly described himself as having “a Nazi streak” and suggested Martin Luther King Jr Day should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/21/trump-nominee-paul-ingrassia-racist-texts"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Plans for Trump-Putin talks in Budapest shelved</h2>  <p>Plans to hold <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/zelenskyy-tomahawk-missiles-trump-putin-budapest">a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Budapest</a> have been put on hold as Ukraine and its European allies rallied in pushing for a ceasefire without territorial concessions from Kyiv.</p> <p>The White House said there were now “no plans” for the US president to meet his Russian counterpart “in the immediate future” as a round of diplomacy at the end of last week failed to yield any significant progress towards ending the war.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/21/plans-for-trump-putin-talks-in-budapest-shelved"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Vance expresses ‘great optimism’ over Gaza ceasefire deal </h2>  <p>Vice-president JD Vance traveled to Israel as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to strengthen the ceasefire agreement in Gaza.
