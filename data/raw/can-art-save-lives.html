<p>This month, <a href="https://art.tfl.gov.uk/projects/saved-by-the-whales-tail-saved-by-art/">Art on the Underground</a> is unveiling a new artwork at Stratford station, London, by the Kurdish artist Ahmet Öğüt, entitled Saved by the Whale’s Tail, Saved by Art. It was inspired by a metro accident outside Rotterdam in which the train overran the elevated station stop, but was saved from plunging into the water below by a 10-metre-high sculpture of a whale’s tail, one of two placed there by artist Maarten Struijs. There were no passengers on board, and the driver managed to escape unharmed.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/02/all-cetaceans-go-whale-sculpture-stops-dutch-train-crashing-into-water">Whale sculpture stops Dutch train crashing into water</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Was this a one-off? Have there been other works of art that have played a rescue role? Or is their potential for salvation solely restricted to the spiritual? <em>Astrid, Coventry</em></p> <p><em>Post your answers (and new questions) below or send them to </em><strong><a href="mailto:nq@theguardian.com">nq@theguardian.com</a></strong><em>.
