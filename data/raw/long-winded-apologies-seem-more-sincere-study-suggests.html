<p>Sorry may be the hardest word, but it is also rather on the short side.</p> <p>And that means it may not be enough to get out of trouble, a study suggests.</p> <p>Researchers found that the more verbose the language used in atonement, the more sincere it comes across.</p> <p>The paper, published in the peer-reviewed British Journal of Psychology journal, found the effort that goes into an apology – or, at least, that appears to go into one – is key to showing how sorry someone is.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jun/29/learning-how-to-apologise-well-best-way-to-say-sorry">How sorry are you? Why learning to apologise well could save your relationships</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may go some way to explaining why Stephen Fry, having offended some at Marylebone Cricket Club with his description of a club “stinking of privilege and classism” last year, offered his apology for having gone “off into a wildly overdone – absolutely – prose picture of the image that some have of the club”.</p> <p>Dr Shiri Lev-Ari, from Royal Holloway, University of London, who conducted the research, said: “Individuals produce longer words in their apologies than in their non-apologetic communication, presumably to express the effort they are willing to exert to express their remorse and/or correct the situation. Correspondingly, individuals interpret apologies with longer words as more apologetic.”</p> <p>She added: “An apology may appear more genuine if it costs someone more to say it – and that can mean the time taken to say or type long words.”</p> <p>Her study put together three versions of effectively identical apologies and tested how people responded to each. For example, it used: “I did not mean to answer in a hostile way” with “I did not mean to reply in a combative style” and “I did not mean to respond in a confrontational manner.”</p> <p>It found the wordiest versions elicited the best response from those to whom the apologies were offered.</p> <p>It also studied samples of tweets from celebrities and other individuals – including where they were apologising and where they were tweeting other types of statement. They found people tended to be more long-winded in their apologies; suggesting at least some recognition that that was what was called for.</p> <p>On average, apology messages from celebrities contained five times more words than their usual tweets, while those from other people tended to be about twice as long as their standard message.</p>
