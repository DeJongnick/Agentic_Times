But don’t mistake this for an entirely placid work of art. It is a century ahead of its time. Guardi’s atmospheric light, and perception of sky and water becoming one, anticipate the French impressionists, especially Monet. And like Monet, Guardi has hidden depths. The atmosphere when you look again is changing, evening is on its way, perhaps a storm. Reality itself seems to melt at the edges. Nothing is quite solid. Let yourself float into this dream.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/francesco-guardi-view-of-the-venetian-lagoon-with-the-tower-of-malghera">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2>Get in touch</h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
