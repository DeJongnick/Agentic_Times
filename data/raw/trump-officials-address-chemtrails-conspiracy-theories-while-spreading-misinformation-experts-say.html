<p>Trump officials’ recent attempt to dispel concerns about “chemtrails” has perplexed and angered some experts who say the administration has itself promoted the conspiracy theory while also spreading climate misinformation.</p> 
<p>“This is an intriguing strategy … in an administration that, depending on agency, is actively promulgating conspiracy theories or at least conspiratorial thinking,” said Timothy Tangherlini, a professor at the Berkeley School of Information who studies the circulation of folklore and conspiracy theories.</p> 
<p>On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/Contrails">website</a> about contrails, trails of white vapor emitted aircrafts. Conspiracy theorists call the streaks “chemtrails” and believe they contain polluting chemicals meant to achieve mass sterilization, weather control or other nefarious plots. Though “it is reasonable to ask questions”, those beliefs are inaccurate, the page makes clear.</p> 
<p>Officials also launched a second <a href="https://www.epa.gov/geoengineering">webpage</a> focused on geoengineering, which correctly notes that schemes to “cool the Earth by intentionally modifying the amount of sunlight” are “being studied”. It says “current federal research activity should not be interpreted as endorsement”, though without explicitly stating that these efforts have not been widely practiced.</p> 
<p>The websites were published as baseless rumors swirled claiming weather-altering technology fueled recent catastrophic flooding in Texas. The EPA, however, says it “planned long ago to release these new online resources” which it had been “working on for months”.</p> 
<p>“Regarding the flooding, EPA stands ready to help Texans get back on their feet in the wake of this tragedy,” a spokesperson said.</p> 
<p>Sijia Xiao, a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who for a <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/research/publications/2021/sensemaking-and-chemtrail-conspiracy-internet-insights-believers-and-ex">2021 study</a> interviewed 20 current and former chemtrails believers, said the conspiracy theory attracts many people looking for simple explanations to tragedies.</p> 
<p>“Several participants in my interviews, they related chemtrails to their personal health problems or environmental concerns like pollution,” she said. “And in this example of the Texas flood, I think people are trying to attribute a clear cause to a real life issue.”</p> 
<p>But as it addresses false causes of the floods, Trump has continually shunned research into the climate crisis, which he has dismissed as a “hoax”. Research <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UUotKNQbrfoUZkuLUO71YeaN76I0HEAN/view?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xH-Ekbkhhog3MZ-29d34_p87eudeR5ns-FyR6uLG-IzrLpnDb1AloKBKmIij0K-iY2xRyoeNvdZ7D95xVsU-VMFJZ_odEqKFJHQ7cadNU9DQprzM&amp;_hsmi=112926468">shows</a> the deluge in the US south-west would have been less intense if not for the climate crisis, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels.</p> 
<p>“Rather than addressing climate change – which makes floods like those in Texas, North Carolina, New Mexico, and Illinois more intense, more deadly and more frequent – Trump’s EPA is wasting taxpayer money chasing baseless conspiracy theories that scientists debunked years ago,” said the Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/10/sheldon-whitehouse-fossil-fuels">climate hawk</a>. “It’s a distraction from the Trump administration’s free pass to big oil on its pollution.”</p> 
<p>Since Trump re-entered the White House in January, EPA has slashed funding for climate research, removed all mentions of climate from federal websites, and cut staff for weather forecasting and scientific agencies. He has also cracked down on climate accountability efforts, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/trump-climate-state-laws-executive-order">lawsuits</a> accusing big oil of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/20/big-oil-is-behind-conspiracy-to-deceive-public-first-climate-racketeering-lawsuit-says">conspiracy</a> to spread climate misinformation.</p> 
<p>The president has also repeatedly referred to green regulations as a “scam” and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2022/03/21/on-fox-donald-trump-calls-climate-change-a-hoax-in-the-1920s-they-were-talking-about-global-freezing/">repeated climate denialist talking points</a>, while his administration has spread <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/643ecb10be528d2c1da863cb/68541b1613026bbfd94181b9_SR2025.1%20-%20Information%20Integrity%20about%20Climate%20Science.pdf">misinformation</a> about elections and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding">vaccines</a>. As recently as two months ago, Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services secretary, also suggested that the chemtrail conspiracy theory is real, saying in a televised town hall he would “do everything in my power to stop” their spread.</p> 
<p>Even after Zeldin announced the new initiative, Kennedy appeared to maintain his position, <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1943341972380418310">praising</a> the administrator and Trump for taking on the “diabolical mass poisoning of our people, our communities, our waterways and farms, and our purple mountains, majesty”.</p> 
<p>“It’s all contributing to this environment, this idea that you should have low trust in institutions,” said Tangherlini, the folklore expert. “And when you have low trust in institutions and in the information sources that you have access to, you are going to come up with a plausible story that resonates.”</p> 
<p>Some have been able to integrate the new EPA websites into those stories, claiming they merely provide evidence that the government is <a href="https://x.com/MJTruthUltra/status/1943347167927898240">continuing</a> to cover up information about chemtrails.</p>

<p>“Conspiracy theory is a self-fulfilling feedback loop where everything can be turned into evidence of supporting their beliefs,” said Xiao.</p> 
<p>Though the chemtrail belief is not based in reality, real conspiracies have existed through American history, said Tangherlini, including ones that involved the cover-up of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/12/vietnam-weaponstechnology">covertly sprayed chemicals</a>.</p> 
<p>Today, the Trump administration is openly dismantling protections against toxic and planet-warming pollutants, allowing corporations to truly conspire against the American people, said Aaron Regunberg, climate accountability project director at the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.</p> 
<p><strong>“</strong>Just like big tobacco lied about cigarettes causing cancer, big oil has spent decades running a vast conspiracy to deceive the public on climate change,” he said. “That’s why Maga [Trump’s Make America Great Again movement] wants us talking about this chemtrails garbage – because there’s a real conspiracy implicating their big oil cronies that they don’t want the American people to think about.”</p>
