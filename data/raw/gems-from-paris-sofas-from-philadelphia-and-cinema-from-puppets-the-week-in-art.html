Soft focus trees form a velvety blue-green sanctuary for a mill whose dilapidation and decay strikes Boucher as delightfully picturesque. In fact, it doesn’t look like a real place at all but a dreamy idyll, inspired by Chinese landscape scenes which were hugely popular in 18th-century Europe. You can picture Boucher’s aristocratic clients delighting in this view of country life and even having a water mill like this one built as a garden folly beside their water feature. And yet, a drawing by Boucher apparently of this place suggests it may actually depict a real water mill beside the Seine.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/francois-boucher-landscape-with-a-watermill">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in Touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
