<p>Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, and the head of BBC News <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/09/tim-davie-expected-to-resign-bbc-director-general">have resigned</a> after a former adviser to the corporation accused it of “serious and systemic” bias in its coverage of issues including Donald Trump, Gaza and trans rights.</p> <p>This afternoon Davie sent the following note to staff:</p> <blockquote> <p>Dear all,</p> <p>I wanted to let you know that I have decided to leave the BBC after 20 years. This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the Chair and Board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days.</p> <p>I am working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.</p> <p>I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering.</p> <p>In these increasingly polarised times, the BBC is of unique value and speaks to the very best of us. It helps make the UK a special place; overwhelmingly kind, tolerant and curious. Like all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable. While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as Director-General I have to take ultimate responsibility.</p> <p>Our organisation is a critical ingredient of a healthy society, as well as a thriving creative sector. We should champion it, not weaponise it.</p> <p>Despite a hugely competitive market, I am proud that the BBC remains the most trusted news brand globally. We have continued to ensure that it is used by almost everyone in the UK as well as hundreds of millions of people globally. Despite the inevitable issues and challenges, our journalism and quality content continues to be admired as a gold standard. Our transition to a digital organisation has been deeply impressive, and our thriving commercial businesses are admired globally. Also, our work together on ensuring that we have the right culture has been important and motivating. I could not be more impressed by what you are achieving.</p> <p>You will ask why now, why this moment?</p> <p>I am BBC through and through, having spent the last 20 years of my life working for this organisation as Director of Marketing, Communications and Audiences, Director of Audio and Music, acting Director-General and Chief Executive of BBC Studios. I care deeply about it and want it to succeed. That is why I want to create the best conditions and space for a new DG to come in and positively shape the next Royal Charter. I hope that as we move forward, a sensible, calm and rational public conversation can take place about the next chapter of the BBC.</p> <p>This timing allows a new DG to help shape the next Charter. I believe we are in a strong position to deliver growth.</p> <p>Thank you again, it has been a wonderful ride, which I have loved. I count myself very lucky to have served as DG no.17. I will have a proper chance to see many of you before I go but I have been incredibly proud to lead the BBC as DG for over five years. It is a precious UK institution and you are a world-class team. Thank you all for the tireless support and friendship.</p> <p>I will always be a passionate cheerleader for civilised society, a strong BBC and a thriving UK.</p> <p>Best wishes,</p> <p>Tim</p> </blockquote> <p>Deborah Turness, who has been the CEO of BBC News since January 2022, sent the following statement to staff:</p> <blockquote> <p>Dear all,</p> <p>I have never been more proud of the work that you do every day. You really are the best of the best.</p> <p>I have taken the difficult decision that it will no longer be my role to lead you in the collective vision that we all have: to pursue the truth with no agenda.</p> <p>The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.</p> <p>As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me – and I took the decision to offer my resignation to the Director-General last night.</p> <p>In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down. While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.</p> <p>In a polarised world, BBC News journalism is more vital than ever, and I could not be prouder of the work that you do. Together we have bucked the global trend, to grow trust in BBC News, and I want to thank you, wherever you are in the world, for your courageous work to deliver that.</p> <p>My plea to you: please keep the courage to continue our mission. I’m only sorry that I won’t be there to lead and champion your brilliant journalism.</p> <p>It has been a great privilege to work with you all.</p> <p>I will now work with Tim to plan an orderly handover to ensure that my decision to step away causes the least disruption possible to the important work that you do.</p> <p>With very best wishes,</p> <p>Deborah</p> </blockquote>
