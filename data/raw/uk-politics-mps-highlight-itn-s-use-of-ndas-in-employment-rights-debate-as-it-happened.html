Here is a flavour of what they are saying.</p> <p>Organisations in the <em><strong>housing or property sector</strong></em> are broadly positive.</p> <p>This is from Richard Beresford, chief executive at the <strong>National Federation of Builders.</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The Labour government is wasting no time in proving that their manifesto pledges on planning reform are real. Planning is a considerable barrier to growth and delivery, not just for housebuilders but for all construction projects, and it had a knock-on effect to the broader industry because clients spend so much of their budget on bureaucracy, not on project outcomes.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is from Melanie Leech, chief executive of the <strong>British Property Federation</strong>.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>There’s a lot to welcome in the latest stage of the government’s planning reforms. We called for strategic planning, easier brownfield development and a more certain local planning process in our planning manifesto <a href="https://bpf.org.uk/media/7724/bpf_planning_manifesto_a4_v13.pdf">‘Building More, Building Better’</a> last year and it seems that government have listened.</em></p> <p><em>Planning at the ‘larger-than-local’ level should mean that housing targets are allocated more sensibly, and that there’s better planning for employment uses …</em></p> <p><em>Greater delegation of planning decisions to planning officers and the better functioning of planning committees will, when combined with wider local government reform, help to improve decision-making and better deploy resource in the system by freeing up committees to deal with larger, more complex developments.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>And this is from Ed Griffiths, chief analyst for <strong>Barbour ABI</strong>, a construction research company.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There has been a planning logjam for several years and the government is clearly laser-focused on changing that picture. There are thousands of renewable energy projects in planning and connecting them to the grid is the huge challenge. This is a major step forward.</p> </blockquote> <p><em><strong>Planning lawyers</strong></em> have also welcomed the reforms (even if they can’t agree whether or not they amount to a radical overhaul).</p> <p>This is from Trevor Ivory, planning partner at <strong>DLA Piper</strong>.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’m glad to see the government has resisted overhauling the rulebook in the planning and infrastructure bill and will deliver what the industry has been calling for.<strong> </strong>This is a collection of sensible, targeted measures that could help delivery without the delay that comes from wholesale reform of the system.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is from Kylie Wesson, planning partner at <strong>Shakespeare Martineau.</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The development industry is breathing a sigh of relief today. For too long committee practice has slowed and stagnated planning decisions, with little oversight, intervention or accountability around decisions. A radical overhaul and the introduction of the national scheme of delegation is not only long overdue, but absolutely necessary to meet the ambitious housing targets set by the government last year. With so many flaws in the system, the government will have its work cut out to rectify them all at once.</p> </blockquote> <p><em><strong>Environmentalists</strong></em> are supportive too.</p> <p>This is from Ami McCarthy, head of politics at <strong>Greenpeace UK.</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>More renewables, faster delivery, cleaner energy, lower bills - what’s not to love? These welcome reforms will supercharge progress towards meeting the UK’s clean power targets, which will reduce our dependence on expensive gas and its volatile prices, as well as help slash emissions and tackle the climate crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p>But <em><strong>free market enthusiasts</strong></em> see the government should be “overhauling the rulebook” and going much further.</p> <p>This is from Kristian Niemietz, editorial director at the <strong>Institute of Economic Affairs</strong>, a libertarian thinktank.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Britain’s inability to build thing has long been the biggest drag on economic dynamism and prosperity, making us all poorer for no good reason. The system has become a playground for semi-professional obstructionists, for whom blocking things has become a way of life.</p> <p>The<em> planning reforms announced today contain several steps in the right direction, because they will close off some of the entry portals for lifestyle NIMBYism. But the emphasis is very much on “streamlining” the existing system, as opposed to overhauling it. If all goes according to plan, the planning bill will deliver a speedier and tidier version of the system we have. But what will stop that system from cluttering up again over time? What will keep the momentum going when the government runs out of steam, or is replaced by a less development-friendly one?</em></p> </blockquote> <p>And this is from <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/03/04/britains-government-may-be-about-to-waste-its-best-chance-of-success">an article</a> in the <strong>Economist</strong>, which champions free market liberalism.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>[After the war] on the Labour government’s benches was a zeal for extending state control, including over property rights. And so they came to pass a landmark law [the Town and Country Planning Act 1947] – among the first of its kind – that prohibited all private development without explicit permission. No longer would land ownership confer the right to build; that power would rest instead with the local council …</p> <p>[Labour MPs now see more building] as this government’s most plausible route to higher growth (and with it better-funded public services, or higher defence spending). They believe they are seizing it.</p> <p>Yet talk to those more immersed in the absurdism of Britain’s planning system, and the story is rather different. “They are assuming the creators of the 1947 system were broadly right,” says John Myers of the YIMBY Alliance, a pressure group for home-building. “They have shied away from real reform and are trying to patch over what is broken,” says Christian Hilber of the London School of Economics. “They’ve not grasped the absolute obstacles to what they need to do,” says Paul Cheshire, also at the LSE.</p> <p>Few question that the government is proposing many welcome changes. Set against the scale of the task, however, the Starmer team appears to be wasting its best shot at success.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Economist argues that the government should be repealing the 1947 Act and introducing a zoning approach to planning instead (where any building in a particular zone is allowed, provided it complies with general, pre-determined rules). It cites Auckland as <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/assets/business/our-research/docs/economic-policy-centre/Zoning%20Reform%20and%20State-Developed%20Housing%20in%20Auckland.pdf">a good example</a> of why this works.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-03-11T17:17:19.792Z">at 5.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-67d056df8f08778856c4ac52" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-03-11T16:14:54.613Z">4.14pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Louise Haigh and Layla Moran give examples of ITN using NDAs to cover up workplace harassment in amendments debate</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>In the Commons MPs are debating amendments to the employment rights bill. The paper <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/59-01/0163/amend/employment_day_rep_0311.pdf">listing all the amendments </a>runs to 274 pages.</p> <p><strong>Louise Haigh</strong>, the Labour former transport secretary, has given a speech promoting her amendment that would ban the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that would prevent workers revealing the harassment they endured, including sexual harassment. Haigh and the Lib Dem MP <strong>Layla Moran</strong> both gave detailed examples of how ITN used NDAs to cover up cases of harassment in the workplace to support their case.</p> <p><strong>Haigh</strong> said it was already known that ITN is a company that has used NDAs to cover-up misconduct. She quoted <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/how-itn-uses-ndas-to-silence-staff/">the account </a>given by the former ITN journalist Daisy Ayliffe who said that, after she complained about being harassed at the company, she was paid off and made to sign an NDA. </p> <p>Haigh said she had another example of ITN using an NDA in this way. She said the victim asked not to be named, and so she described him as Mr B.</p> <p>Haigh said Mr B joined ITN in 2008 through a scheme designed to help disabled people join the workplace. He had a neurologicial condition that could lead to seizures. ITN made reasonable adjustments, and he was happy with the support he had until he moved to another job.</p> <p>But, when Mr B returned to ITN in 2017, he got none of the support had received before, Haigh said. She went on:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The situation got so bad that he had what he describes as his first ‘full-blown’ seizure in seven years and the zone outs and blackouts became increasingly frequent. After suffering from one particular seizure at work, he was required to apologise to everyone who had witnessed it. </p> <p>And he was repeatedly accused of lying about his disability and told his issues were nothing to do with his disability, despite joining ITN on a disability inclusion scheme.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mr B took ITN to a tribunal. He settled but, he was required to sign an NDA. Haigh said that his health deteroriated to the exent that for a while he was homeless. She said her amendment was needed to stop NDAs being used in this way.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If it can happen in organisations like ITN, whose literal job it is to expose injustice, or in trade unions whose job it is to protect workers, then it can happen anywhere. </p> </blockquote> <p>In her speech, <strong>Moran</strong> she said she had her own example ITN using an NDA to cover up harassment. She said the victim, whom she did not name, joined ITN in her 20s, but quickly became involved in “a coercive, controlling sexual relationship with an older, male editor”. He accused her of affairs with colleagues, but she ended up suffering panic attacks.</p> <p>After she ended the relationship, she was demoted and had her hours reduced. When she complained to other editors, they told her not to speak out. One told her, ‘It’s not like he ever hit you’, Moran said.</p> <p>Moran said that it took months for the woman to get HR to take up her complaint. “HR found they could not assess the complaint, as it was criminal in nature, but at the same time found [the complaints] to be unfounded,” Moran said, pointing out this did not make sense.</p> <p>Moran said that, when the woman asked at staff event what support was available for women reporting alleged sexual harassment, she was suspended without pay. ITN told her not to tell anyone what happened, and even her best friend had to sign an NDA to attend a meeting to support her. </p> <p>Moran said the woman got a settlement eventually, but it was “extremely one-sided”, and the NDA covered not just her, but her partner, her best friend and her parents. The woman ended up in hospital because of the damage to her mental health, but even in hospital she was getting regular messages from the ITN lawyers telling her to sign the NDA.</p> <p>Moran said MPs were “kidding ourselves” if they thought NDAs weren’t still be used. She said the woman thought ITN was “trying to change”, and that her own NDA might be lifted. But she said Haigh’s amendment was needed because NDAs like this should never be allowed in the first place.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67d051e78f087aea3a248ef0" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-03-11T15:15:40.339Z">3.15pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Local Government Association welcomes parts of planning bill, but suggests it involves too much centralisation</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The cross-party <strong>Local Government Association</strong> has broadly welcomed the planning and infrastructure bill, while expressing concern that it could involve too much centralisation. This is from Adam Hug, the Labour leader of Westminster council and the LGA’s housing and planning spokesperson.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This bill has included some of the LGA’s long term asks, such as making it easier for councils to purchase vacant land for house building, localising planning fees, and increasing planning capacity. These will speed up the planning process and ease the building of new homes and necessary infrastructure we need across the country.</p> <p>However, there remains concerns around how it will ensure that councils – who know their areas best and what they need – remain at the heart of the planning process. The democratic role of councillors in decision-making is the backbone of the English planning system, and this should not be diminished.

The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/03/10/farmers-sell-fields-to-councils-lower-value/">Telegraph story</a> presents this as a fresh Labour attack on farmers. It quotes <strong>Tim Bonner</strong> from the Countryside Alliance as saying:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We have been supportive of many of the government’s changes to planning policy, but giving councils more power to reduce the value of land is a step too far, especially in the context of such a challenging outlook for farmers and the inheritance tax fiasco.</p> <p>This is not about people blocking development, it’s about the state paying the market price for land. We need more houses and more economic development, but not at the cost of basic principles.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/jacksurfleet/status/1899239807244497394">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tuesday&#39;s DAILY TELEGRAPH: Farmers hit again in Rayner land grab<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href="https://t.co/MyBWO6kCA0">pic.twitter.com/MyBWO6kCA0</a></p>&mdash; Jack Surfleet (@jacksurfleet) <a href="https://twitter.com/jacksurfleet/status/1899239807244497394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2025</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>In his interviews <strong>Pennycook</strong> did not challenge the facts of the story. He told LBC the government was giving councils the power to disapply “hope value” in a compulsory purchase acquisition “where there’s a site with a significant public interest involved, higher affordable levels of housing, for example, or health and education facilities”. But he said this was not aimed at farmers.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We are obviously and very clearly not setting out to target agricultural land. The land use framework we’re consulting on currently will ensure that prime agricultural land is protected, and food security is protected.</p> <p>I see this power being used in particular, to much greater effect – and that’s where I want to see it come forward – specifically in urban areas, on previously developed brownfield land where regeneration projects with a significant public interest can be unlocked more easily.</p> </blockquote> <p>When he was asked to admit that the Telegraph was right to say farmers could be affected, Pennycook said he did not think the Telegraph was right – “and it’s not often right, I must say” – because the final decision would rest with the local authority. Ministers would not be saying that prime agricultural land should be sold, he said.</p> <p>Asked about the same issue on the Today programme, Pennycook said that he was “somewhat mystified that the Telegraph have looked through our CPO powers through the lens of farmers and prime agricultural land” when he expected them to be used mostly “for regeneration projects on previously developed brownfield land in urban centres”.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Keir Starmer to chair cabinet.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p>After 12.30pm: MPs start debating the remaining stages of the employment rights bill.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line or message me on social media.
