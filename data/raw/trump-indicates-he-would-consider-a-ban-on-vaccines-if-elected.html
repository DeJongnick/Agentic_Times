<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has suggested vaccines could be banned if he becomes president, in the clearest sign yet of a radical shake-up in public health policy should he put his ally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a> in charge of it.</p> <p>Trump on Sunday told <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-banning-vaccines-president-rfk-fluoride-rcna178570">NBC</a> that Kennedy, the anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist and former independent candidate who dropped out and endorsed Trump, would have a “big role in the administration” if wins Tuesday’s presidential election.

Kennedy called fluoride “industrial waste” and claimed it was linked to cancer.
