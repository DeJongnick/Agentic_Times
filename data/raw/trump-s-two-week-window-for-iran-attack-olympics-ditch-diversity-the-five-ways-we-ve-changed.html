<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>Australia’s changing way of life is highlighted by five key trends in two pieces of research released today by the e61 Institute and by KPMG. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/20/five-ways-australians-spending-housing-and-dating-habits-have-changed-over-the-last-25-years">Luca Ittamani finds</a> that young people are living with their parents for longer compared with 25 years ago thanks to the housing crisis, and are less likely to be living with a partner. Another result of expensive housing is that young families are more likely to move around to find cheaper accommodation.</p>
