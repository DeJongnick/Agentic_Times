<p>The House on Thursday voted 206-198 to block the release of the ethics committee’s long-awaited report investigating allegations of sexual misconduct and potential illegal activities involving former Florida Republican representative Matt Gaetz.</p> <p>The report in question details allegations that Gaetz engaged in illicit drug use, misuse of campaign funds and sexual misconduct with a 17-year-old girl, and allegations of obstructing the House investigation. Gaetz has consistently denied the claims.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/05/biden-library-hunter-pardon-democrats-threat">Biden library reportedly under threat by Democrats enraged by Hunter pardon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The House ethics committee met earlier on Wednesday and made no decision about what to do with the findings of its investigation into Gaetz.</p> <p>The vote comes weeks after Gaetz’s resignation from Congress and his withdrawal as a potential Trump administration nominee when it became clear he did not have enough support from senators to survive a confirmation hearing. Democrats, led by Representatives Sean Casten and Steve Cohen, had attempted to force the report’s release through privileged resolutions, arguing that transparency was crucial.</p> <p>Casten’s resolution, sent to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/03/matt-gaetz-ethics-report">House two days before the vote</a>, said that withholding the report would “undermine the committee’s credibility and impede the safety, dignity, and integrity of legislative proceedings”.</p> <p>Casten cited at least four examples since 1987 of the ethics panel continuing its work and releasing investigative findings after a representative had resigned from Congress.</p> <p>But Mississippi Republican Michael Guest, the committee chair, said the panel’s investigative jurisdiction ended when a member leaves Congress.</p> <p>“He’s no longer a member,” Guest <a href="https://apnews.com/article/matt-gaetz-house-ethics-committee-report-release-48db6698d172bedb3b847fc9d3c0f96b?__cf_chl_tk=PQnPOdiXTNQoJPs7ZUfu3jbENCom8YG9TfDb8GKaDII-1733423560-1.0.1.1-YoM30XCTdNnUzyMwiWVYmgPOfyA6aCYCn3VXOnyIxKY">told reporters on Thursday</a>. “He is no longer going to be confirmed by the Senate because he withdrew his nomination to be the attorney general.”</p> <p>The committee – made up of five Republicans and five Democrats – deadlocked along party lines last month when they voted on whether to release the investigative findings.</p> <p>The report’s potential revelations could have significant political implications, particularly as Gaetz is rumored to be considering <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-gaetz-hints-florida-governor-run-possible-desantis-successor-2024-11">a bid for Florida governor in 2026</a> or seeking another role in the incoming Trump administration.</p> <p>The investigation, which has gone on for years, gained additional scrutiny after Gaetz’s associate <a href="https://apnews.com/article/crime-arrests-florida-congress-government-and-politics-d657eda08a857f4c0a07d293bb109308">Joel Greenberg pleaded guilty in 2021</a> to paying women and an underage girl for sexual services.</p>
