<p>A group of leading lawyers has submitted an official complaint to Fifa, alleging the governing body has failed to follow its own human rights rules in relation to the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia. The 30-page complaint has been filed via Fifa’s official grievance mechanism and calls for immediate action in five areas.</p> <p>The complaint has been authored by Fifa’s former anti-corruption adviser Mark Pieth, the Swiss lawyer Stefan Wehrenberg and the British barrister Rodney Dixon, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/22/fifa-told-to-deny-saudi-arabia-2034-world-cup-without-human-rights-reforms">submitted a report</a> to Fifa a year ago warning of the risks of awarding the tournament to the Gulf state.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/15/robbed-of-husbands-fathers-and-a-future-families-of-nepali-workers-killed-in-saudi-arabia-mens-world-cup-2034-justice">‘We were poor, but at least we were together’: families of Nepali workers killed in Saudi Arabia wait for justice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The complaint argues that the bidding process “failed to ensure that human rights standards were met” and says: “Fifa’s decision to approve Saudi Arabia as the next host country now places Fifa, in accordance with its own policy, under an obligation to ensure that internationally recognised human rights are upheld in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>“To date there is no evidence that such steps have been initiated, let alone that Fifa has any intention of doing so. This complaint highlights these failings so that they can be rectified without delay.”</p> <p>The five areas outlined relate to freedom of expression and association; arbitrary arrests, mistreatment and the death penalty; judicial independence; migrants’ rights; and women’s rights.</p> <p>“Fifa must develop a concrete and transparent action plan in collaboration with the Saudi authorities, rather than relying on the host state to act unilaterally,” the complaint says. “This plan must incorporate minimum requirements … ensure their immediate implementation and establish robust mechanisms for ongoing monitoring. To date, no such steps have been initiated by Fifa.”</p> <p>This week Fifa faced criticism and demands for action over the treatment of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia. Reports by Human Rights Watch and FairSquare <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/14/pressure-grows-on-fifa-as-reports-warn-of-serious-risk-to-workers-amid-saudi-world-cup-building-boom">highlighted the risks faced</a> by those involved in the vast development projects commissioned by the Saudi regime under the direction of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The reports said workers continued to face severe risks to life and criticised the lack of transparency surrounding the deaths of migrant workers.</p> <p>In response to Human Rights Watch, Fifa wrote a letter stating: “Fifa seeks to play its part in ensuring strong protections for workers employed by third parties in the construction of Fifa World Cup sites. This work involves a close collaboration with its Saudi counterparts and engagements with relevant international labour organisations … we are convinced that measures implemented … can set a new standard for worker protection.”</p> <p>Fifa has been approached for comment.</p>
