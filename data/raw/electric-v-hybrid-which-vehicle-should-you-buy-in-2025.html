<p>It wasn’t long ago that electric cars were the darlings of the showroom.</p> <p>Buyers were queueing to own vehicles that, at the time, were hard to get hold of and held the promise of lower running costs.</p> <p>But in 2024 the new car sales tables turned.</p> <p>Sales of EVs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/battery-powered-electric-vehicle-sales-plunge-by-25-as-australian-drivers-choose-hybrid-models">have largely plateaued</a> – they finished the year up 4.7% – while hybrids are booming, up 75% over the same period.</p> <p>For every EV sold Australians snapped up 2.1 hybrids, some of them plug-in hybrids that can be recharged externally (most hybrids, including Toyotas, run purely on petrol).</p> <h2>A numbers game</h2> <p>Much of it comes down to price and choice.</p> <p>Many desirable EVs are priced about $60,000 and above, keeping them out of reach of many.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/06/australia-ev-cars-electric-vehicle-buying-guide-2024">Buying your first electric vehicle in Australia? Here’s what you should know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bulk of the hybrid activity has occurred below that threshold, making them more attainable to average families.</p> <p>That’s in part because EVs are still expensive.</p> <p>Batteries cost a lot to manufacture and EVs typically have battery packs 50 to 100 times bigger than what you get in a hybrid.</p> <p>Those prices, along with charging infrastructure, are what the corporate affairs manager at Cox Automotive, Mike Costello, labels “two of the impediments” to people adopting EVs.</p> <h2>EVs cost less to run</h2> <p>Despite their upfront cost, EVs generally cost less to own than a hybrid.</p> <p>Take the Tesla Model Y and Toyota RAV4 Hybrid as an example.</p> <p>The RAV4 uses a claimed average 4.7 litres of fuel per 100km. The Australian Institute of Petroleum reports average unleaded prices of $1.72 for the past 12 months.</p> <p>For a RAV4 that covers 13,500km it would cost $1,115 in fuel, about half that of many rival SUVs.</p> <p>The Tesla uses 14.6kWh of electricity per 100km.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>“If people are hearing from friends or loved ones or colleagues that they’re saving so much money, that’s a really powerful message.”</p> <footer> <cite>Mike Costello</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Electricity prices vary but tend to hover around 30-35 cents a kilowatt hour, depending on where you live.</p> <p>That would mean something like $680 to take the Tesla the same distance.</p> <p>However, many EV owners charge during off-peak times or use EV electricity plans to take advantage of lower rates.</p> <p>That could lower your EV electricity bill to something like $250 – or less.</p> <p>It’s the opposite if you go on a road trip. EV fast charging is expensive – it can top 80c/kWh.</p> <p>That’s more than you’d pay for a hybrid on the same road trip – but it’s only for that road trip.</p> <p>So even if you do 2,000km a year relying on ultra-rapid charging and pay that 80c/kWh – then utilise cheaper charging rates at home – your car’s annual electricity bill would still be less than $500.</p> <p>Costello says getting that message to those considering an EV is invaluable.</p> <p>“If people are hearing from friends or loved ones or colleagues that they’re saving so much money, that’s a really powerful message.”</p> <p>There’s also the convenience of charging at home rather than having to visit petrol stations.</p> <h2>Tax benefits</h2> <p>Those running costs are before you take into account potential tax benefits.</p> <p>Electric cars priced below $91,387 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/10/evs-novated-lease-savings-fringe-benefits-tax">can take advantage of a fringe benefits tax exemption</a> that allows salaried employees to lease them out of their pre-tax income. The lease can also incorporate running costs, including registration, servicing and insurance.</p> <p>The same FBT exemption applies to plug-in hybrid vehicles until April 2025.</p> <p>It means an EV or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle can be cheaper to lease than a hybrid costing $15,000 or $20,000 more.</p> <p>And the benefits continue throughout the lease period.</p> <p>Regular hybrids – the popular ones that run purely on petrol – aren’t entitled to the same tax break.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related:</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/07/tesla-annual-sales-decline-australia-ev-electric-vehicle-market-hybrids-byd-chinese-brands">Tesla sales in Australia are sliding for the first time. Is it stiff competition or the Musk factor?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to LeasePlan’s online calculator, a person earning $100,000 and leasing a Toyota Camry Ascent ($44,348 drive-away in NSW) to drive 15,000km annually over three years would take home $62,037 after tax and leasing costs.</p> <p>That same person could buy a Tesla Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive ($59,845 drive-away in NSW) and take home $63,629.</p> <p>That’s a $1,592 annual benefit to buy a car that retails for about $15,000 more.</p> <h2>We mostly don’t drive too far from home</h2> <p>Some argue against an EV because they’re worried it won’t be able to take them across the Nullarbor.</p> <p>Despite having never driven across the Nullarbor, they conjure up worst-case scenarios … just in case.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/tourism-and-transport/survey-motor-vehicle-use-australia/latest-release">average distance driven by Australians each day is about 33km</a>, so an average EV may need to be charged every 10 days or so.</p> <p>While Costello acknowledges that those without off-street parking face bigger hurdles to EV adoption, the millions with freestanding houses and a home charger are “particularly well placed to get the best from [an EV]”.</p> <p>And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/16/best-ev-electric-vehicles-road-trip-distance">when you do go on that road trip,</a> new and improving infrastructure – particularly on major routes – means you can now add a few hundred kilometres of range in less than 20 minutes.</p> <p>Perfect for a coffee and rest stop!</p> <h2>The middle ground</h2> <p>When the product – and price – is right, buyers respond.</p> <p>In October MG <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/23/mg4-ev-hatchback-australia-electric-car-prices-value-cheapest">sold its MG4 hatch for $30,990 drive-away</a> (it’s since risen to $34,990), the cheapest a new EV has been in Australia to date.</p> <p>It was the top selling EV for that month – it was also the second-bestselling small car, outsold only by the Toyota Corolla.</p> <p>There’s EV success elsewhere, too, especially in the medium car market.</p> <p>For the first time EVs accounted for more than half of all medium car sales. Of the 46,146 medium cars sold last year 27,382 of them – 59% – were powered solely by electricity.</p> <p>Given only five of the 20-plus models are electric, it shows the strength when the product is compelling.</p> <ul> <li><p>Toby Hagon is a motoring journalist and the editor of <a href="https://evcentral.com.au/">EV Central</a></p></li> </ul>
