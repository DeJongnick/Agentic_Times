<p>Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he was nominating the podcaster and former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks to be his White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar, continuing a pattern of rewarding big donors with political power.</p> <p>Sacks, a venture capitalist and Silicon Valley insider, hosted big spenders at his San Francisco mansion in June to support the Trump campaign, with tickets ranging up to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-31/trump-conviction-doesn-t-matter-to-elon-musk-david-sacks-tech-backers">$300,000 a head</a>. The event reportedly raked in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/us/politics/trump-sacks-silicon-valley-donors.html">more than $12m</a>.</p> <p>A host of the popular podcast All-In, Sacks shares the mic with Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis and David Friedberg in weekly episodes that focus on “all things economic, tech, political, social and poker”.</p> <p>He has also been closely linked with Elon Musk and helped to back his bid to acquire Twitter, the social media platform renamed X. The two tech titans reportedly joined together to push the president-elect to name JD Vance as his running mate.</p> <p>Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/19/jd-vance-trump-vp-pick-silicon-valley">clearly heeded the advice</a>. And now he has welcomed Sacks into the federal government to offer guidance and leadership to bolster the crypto industry and artificial intelligence, “two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness”, according to Trump’s post.</p> <p>Along with this new position as an adviser, Trump has tapped Sacks to head his council of advisers for science and technology, an independent committee of experts historically charged with helping presidents make important decisions and developing evidence-based recommendations on policy.</p> <p>Their work affects a range of specialized areas, from energy and the environment to public health and national security.</p> <p>The committee is currently co-chaired by three esteemed scientists, including Dr Arati Prabhakar, an engineer and applied physicist and former director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p> <p>Sacks will take on a specific set of priorities, according to Trump’s post, which did not delve into whether science will play a part.</p> <p>“He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship,” Trump continued. “He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the US.”</p> <p>The Sacks announcement came among a slew of posts shared in the evening on Thursday as Trump named other allies of his to the incoming administration.</p> <p>David Perdue, a former senator and long-time Maga loyalist who faced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/04/republican-david-perdue-georgia-senate-runoff-traded-bank-stocks">federal scrutiny</a> over his stock trading while in office, was named as the ambassador to China – a key diplomatic role as Trump stokes trade tensions.</p> <p>Rodney S Scott, the former chief of the US Border Patrol and a border-wall advocate, was picked for US Customs and Border Protection commissioner. Caleb Vitello, who currently serves as assistant director of the Office of Firearms and Tactical Programs was selected as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).</p> <p>The former border patrol agent Brandon Judd was named ambassador to Chile. The Ice special agent Tony Salisbury was chosen for deputy homeland security adviser.</p>
