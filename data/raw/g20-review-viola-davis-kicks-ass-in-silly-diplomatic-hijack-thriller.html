<p>When a G20 summit is hijacked by highly trained mercenaries demanding the adoption of a global cryptocurrency (or something like that, it’s not entirely clear), the US president risks life and limb to save the hostages and restore global order. Yep, we’re deep into fantasy territory with this preposterous, dumb-as-rocks action picture.
