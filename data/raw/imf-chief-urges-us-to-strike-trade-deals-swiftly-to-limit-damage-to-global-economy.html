<p>IMF managing director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/kristalina-georgieva">Kristalina Georgieva</a> has urged the US to strike trade deals urgently to limit the damage to the global economy from Donald Trump’s tariff policies.</p> <p>Speaking at a press conference at the IMF’s spring meetings in Washington, Georgieva declined to criticise the US administration directly; but warned that what she called “major trade policy shifts” had “spiked uncertainty off the charts”.</p> <p>“A trade policy settlement among the main players is essential, and we are urging them to do it swiftly, because uncertainty is very costly,” she said.</p> <p>“I cannot stress this strongly enough: without certainty, businesses do not invest, households prefer to save rather than to spend – and this further weakens prospects for already weakened growth.”</p> <p>Financial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/23/stock-markets-rise-as-trump-says-he-will-reduce-tariffs-on-china-substantially">markets were buoyed earlier this week</a> by signs of softening in Trump’s stance on trade, with the president suggesting he believed a deal with China was possible, that could result in significantly lower tariffs than the current 145%.</p> <p>But no deal has yet been signed, and other countries – including the UK – are also in talks with Washington.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, the British chancellor, is expected to discuss the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/24/thursday-briefing-rachel-reeves-heads-to-washington-in-pursuit-of-a-trade-deal-will-she-get-one">prospects for a trade agreement</a> when she meets the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, this week but she said on Wednesday that the UK was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/23/rachel-reeves-dashes-hopes-of-early-breakthrough-in-uk-us-trade-deal">“not going to rush”</a> into a deal.</p> <p>Meanwhile the IMF <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/22/imf-major-negative-shock-trump-tariffs-uk">downgraded its forecasts</a> for global economic growth this week, and warned of further downside risks if the trade war escalated. “Simply put, the world economy is facing a new and major test,” said Georgieva.</p> <p>She added the situation was particularly challenging because many countries had little room for policy manoeuvre, after already enduring a series of economic shocks in recent years.</p> <p>Asked what the mood of the delegations from the fund’s member-countries in Washington had been this week, Georgieva said, “the membership is anxious”.</p> <p>“We were just about to step on the road to more stability after multiple shocks. We were projecting 3.3% growth, and actually we were worried that this was not strong enough – and here we are,” she said. The IMF is now forecasting global growth of 2.8% for this year.</p> <p>With many multilateral institutions under attack from the Trump administration, Georgieva welcomed a speech by Bessent on Wednesday, in which he said the Bretton Woods institutions – the IMF and the World Bank – had “enduring value”.</p> <p>“I very much appreciate Secretary Bessent’s reiteration of the US commitment to the Fund and to its role,” she said.</p> <p>However, Bessent also criticised the institutions fiercely for what he called “mission creep”, and their “sprawling and unfocused agendas”, including issues such as gender and climate change.</p> <p>Responding to a question about these claims, Georgieva declined to say whether the IMF would continue to work on climate or gender.</p> <p>But she replied: “I want to say that I actually agree with the secretary on one thing. It’s a very complicated world, a world of massive challenges of all kinds.” Stressing that the Fund was a “very fiscally disciplined institution”, she added: “Yes, we have to focus.”</p>
