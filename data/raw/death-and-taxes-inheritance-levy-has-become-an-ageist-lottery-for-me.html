<p>I am 83 next birthday and, so that my descendants escape the potential inheritance tax bill of £6m-plus, I’ll have to survive until October 2032 (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/family-firms-labour-tax-rises-manufacturers">‘Our plans could be derailed’: family firms say Labour tax rises will force fire sales, 16 September</a>). My firm is property-based. In the event of an earlier demise, sites will require disposal within six months, cruelly affecting investment, growth&nbsp;and employment.</p> <p>In my case the tax has turned into an ageist lottery. At the moment plans are afoot to rig up a life-support unit at home with an instruction to pull the plug on the appointed day, seven years hence. Any suggestions for relief, Rachel?<br><strong>Robert Thomas</strong><br><em>Chairman, Remarkable Pubs</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
