<h2>Faking It</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong><strong><br></strong>The first run of this reality show in the early 00s was underpinned by a sense that the participants were learning not just a new trade but a new outlook. There’s less emphasis on that aspect in this revival, but it’s fun anyway. We begin with Rex, a luxury estate agent from Surrey who is going to Bolton (“It’s a town up north somewhere” apparently) to become a market trader. Given his floppy hair, dainty shoes and adoption of the least convincing northern accent since Daphne in Frasier, he has his work cut out.<em> Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Who Do You Think You Are?</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>A heavily pregnant Aisling Bea digs into her roots before bringing a new branch into the world. Tracing her lineage through County Laois to the remote Blasket Islands, she discovers strong women and Irish rebels: from a formidable, widowed farmer expanding her land to a great-grandfather who defied British rule. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>The British Blood Scandal: Poisoned at School</h2>    <p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong><strong><br></strong>A deep dive into the infected blood scandal centred on the Lord Mayor Treloar School and Hospital in Hampshire. Through the 1970s and 80s, hundreds of young haemophiliacs were given Factor VIII, a drug intended to cure their condition but that was, in fact, an effective death sentence. A grim insight into one of the worst disasters in the history of the NHS. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Big Zuu and AJ Tracey’s Rich Flavours</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Max</strong><strong><br></strong>A series of delightful working holidays for Big Zuu and his rapper cousin AJ Tracey, as the pair travel the world sampling some of its most expensive dining experiences. They begin in Korea, enjoying a wagyu-heavy barbecue and cooking for Korean royalty. “I’m a little bit worried about Zuu’s behaviour,” confesses AJ, primly. “He’s very loud.” <em>PH</em></p> <h2>The Brontës by Anita Rani: Sisters of Disruption</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Arts</strong><strong><br></strong>As a childhood “misfit”, and one of the few Asian girls in her Bradford school, Anita Rani was as inspired by the Brontë sisters as Nirvana and Neneh Cherry. In this passionate film, she visits Brontë country to discover why their stories were so disruptive. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Matlock</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Witness</strong><strong><br></strong>Give this reboot marks for ingenuity: undercover lawyer Kathy Bates only uses the name “Matlock” because her wily character is a fan of the old TV show. But as season one wraps up, Mattie’s covert opioid investigation has been revealed, upsetting her steely colleague Olympia (Skye P Marshall). Can they still work together? <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Catching Fire: The Story of Anita Pallenberg (Alexis Bloom and Svetlana Till, 2023), 10pm, Sky Arts</strong></p>    <p>Interspersed with words taken from her own unpublished memoir and a trove of home movie footage, Alexis Bloom and Svetlana Zill’s candid documentary gets as close to the “bohemian rock chick” Anita Pallenberg as we’re probably going to get. She blazed a trail from impoverished Italian aristocracy to feted New York model to lover of three Rolling Stones, retaining her independent spirit through fame, hard drugs and motherhood, mesmerising everyone she met. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p>
