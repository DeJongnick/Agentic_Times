  <p><strong>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (</strong><strong>Cair) is denouncing Israel for launching airstrikes on Gaza despite a shaky ceasefire.</strong></p> 
  <p>“Since the start of the ceasefire, the Netanyahu regime has been itching to fully restart the genocide in Gaza,” Cair said in a <a href="https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-calls-israels-renewed-bombing-of-civilians-aid-blockade-a-restart-of-the-genocide/">statement</a>. “The cruel and unnecessary mass bombing of civilians across Gaza constitutes a blatant violation of President Trump’s ceasefire agreement and a resumption of the genocide. President Trump must rein in the Israeli occupation forces and stop sending American weapons and American taxpayer dollars to fund Israel’s war machine.”</p>

  <p><strong>Gaza’s civil defen</strong><strong>ce agency and hospitals said a series of Israeli air</strong><strong>strikes across the territory killed at least 45 people</strong> <strong>on Sunday</strong>, updating an earlier toll of 33, according to AFP.</p> 
  <p>The Israeli military said it had struck dozens of Hamas targets across the Gaza Strip, as Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the nine-day-old ceasefire brokered by Trump.</p> 
  <p>“At least 45 people were killed as a result of Israeli airstrikes on various areas of the Gaza Strip,” Mahmud Bassal, spokesperson for the civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue service under Hamas authority, told AFP.</p> 
  <p>Four hospitals in Gaza confirmed the death toll to AFP, saying they had received the dead and wounded.</p> 
  <p>Earlier, Bassal detailed several of the strikes.</p> 
  <p>He said six people were killed when an Israeli strike targeted a “group of civilians” in Zuwaida town in central Gaza. Six other people, including children, were killed and 13 others injured in two separate strikes near Nuseirat in central Gaza, Bassal said.</p> 
  <p>A woman and two children were killed when a drone strike hit a tent housing displaced people near Asdaa City, north of Khan Younis. Two people, including a journalist, were killed and several others injured in an Israeli strike in the western part of Zuwaida.</p> 
  <p>In another attack, two people were killed and several injured when an Israeli strike hit a tent in the Al-Ahli Club area in Nuseirat, Bassal said. Two more people were killed in an Israeli airstrike in eastern Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, he added.</p> 
  <p>One individual was killed in a strike on an apartment in a building in western Gaza City, the civil defence agency said. The others succumbed later on Sunday to injuries incurred in these strikes, Bassal said.</p>

  <p><strong>The fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced its first major test Sunday as an Israeli security official said the transfer of aid into the territory was halted “until further notice”</strong> after a Hamas ceasefire violation, and Israeli forces launched a wave of strikes, according to the Associated Press.</p> 
  <p>The official spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement on the halt in aid, a little over a week since the start of the US-proposed ceasefire aimed at ending two years of war.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s military earlier Sunday said its troops came under fire from Hamas militants in southern Gaza, and later said two soldiers were killed there.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s military said then it struck dozens of what it called Hamas targets. Health officials said at least 29 Palestinians were killed across Gaza, including children.</p> 
  <p>A senior Egyptian official involved in the ceasefire negotiations said “round-the-clock” contacts were under way to de-escalate the situation. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to speak to reporters.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Israel</strong> <strong>has closed its crossing</strong> points into Gaza to aid convoys, <strong>a security official told AFP</strong> on Sunday after the government accused Hamas of violating a ceasefire agreement.</p> 
  <p>The ceasefire agreement had committed Israel to let in 600 trucks carrying aid into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> every day.</p> 
  <p>It had halved the amount as it accused <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a> of violating the agreement by failing to return all the deceased hostages in time.</p> 
  <p>It has so far also <strong>refused to reopen the key border crossing of Rafah</strong>, the only access point that is not exclusively controlled by Israel.</p> 
  <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/22/ipc-declares-famine-gaza-city">famine was declared</a> in and around Gaza City by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) in August after a previous blockade of aid deliveries.</p>

   <li><p><strong>The fragile Gaza ceasefire edged close to total collapse on Sunday amid renewed Israeli airstrikes across Gaza, including in the cities of Rafah and Beit Lahia, which killed and injured several Palestinians.</strong> <strong>Israel</strong> says the attacks were a response to Hamas gunfire and rocket-propelled grenade fire against its troops in Rafah. <strong>Hamas </strong>said that it was unaware of any incidents or clashes in Rafah, and accused Israel of a deliberate escalation.

   <li><p><strong>Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered “firm action” across Gaza in response to the clashes</strong>, meeting defence minister <strong>Israel Katz</strong> and intelligence chiefs to instruct strikes on “terror targets”.

   <li><p><strong>Israel’s defence minister warned Hamas would “pay a heavy price”</strong> for any further ceasefire breaches, saying Israeli troops would respond “increasingly severely” if attacks continue.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Hamas has dismissed a statement from the</strong> <strong>US state department</strong> that accused the group of planning an imminent attack in Gaza, <strong>calling the allegation “false”</strong> and “aligned with <strong>misleading Israeli propaganda</strong>.”</p> 
  <p>In a statement on Sunday, Hamas said: “<strong>The US allegations are false and fully align with the misleading Israeli propaganda</strong> and provide cover for the continuation of the occupation’s crimes and organised aggression against our people in Gaza.”</p> 
  <p>The comments came after the <strong>state department</strong> said late on Saturday it had obtained “<strong>credible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza</strong>.” The US warned that “should Hamas proceed with this attack, <strong>measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire</strong>,” without providing details of the alleged plan.</p> 
  <p><strong>Hamas</strong> rejected the accusation, calling on Washington to “stop repeating the occupation’s misleading narrative and focus on curbing its repeated violations of the ceasefire agreement.”</p> 
  <p>The militant group said: “The <strong>facts on the ground reveal the exact opposite</strong>, as the occupation authorities are the ones who formed, armed, and funded criminal gangs that carried out killings, kidnappings, theft of aid trucks, and assaults against Palestinian civilians … confirming the occupation’s involvement in spreading chaos and disrupting security.”</p>

  <p>Writing in his account, Fletcher described the scale of devastation as “staggering,” adding: “Nothing prepares you for Gaza – the scale of destruction, the density of loss, the quiet resilience in people’s eyes.”</p> 
  <p>He said that despite the ceasefire, “every inch tells a story of loss … Gaza is a wasteland. Roads choked with rubble.”</p> 
  <p>Fletcher, who has been coordinating aid convoys through Egypt, urged world leaders to keep the humanitarian lifeline open: “We owe it to those who have endured so much to move beyond the cycle of cruelty, terror and revenge.”</p>

  <p>According to <strong>The Times of Israel</strong>, “terror operatives in the Gaza Strip launched an attack on Israeli forces in Rafah,” prompting the strikes.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Israeli military said that Hamas militants have carried out “multiple attacks”</strong> against Israeli forces beyond the “yellow line” buffer zone, including a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire, calling it a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire.</p>
