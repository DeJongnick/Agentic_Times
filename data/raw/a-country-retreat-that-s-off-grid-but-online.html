<p>Your article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/oct/11/off-grid-cottage-herefordshire-west-england-fishing-hiking">‘I step outside into a cacophony of nature’: an off-grid escape in the west of England, 11 October</a>) sings the praises of a cottage that, on its website, boasts about the fast broadband, copious USB points and good mobile phone signal.

If parliament is not sitting, In Our Time, available on&nbsp;demand, also works a treat. <br><strong>Tim Martineau</strong><br><em>Prenton, </em><em>Merseyside </em></p> <p>• My favourite mondegreen (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/03/emma-chisit-check-your-karen-vallance">Letters, 3 October</a>) was from an interview with Andy Murray following a grand slam victory. The interviewer asked: “How do you feel after that match, Andy?” The subtitle read: “How do you feel after that much brandy?”<br><strong>Richard Williams</strong><br><em>Hove, East Sussex</em></p> <p>• It may be time for a Guardian wallchart on the benefits of Brexit (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/10/brexit-blame-crisis-uk-steel-keir-starmer">We all know Brexit’s to blame for the crisis facing UK steel…, 10&nbsp;October</a>).&nbsp;Cheap to produce as&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be blank.<br><strong>Neil Sanderson</strong><br><em>Newbury, Berkshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
