<p>A 114-year-old woman residing in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> who says she never smoked or drank alcohol recently became the oldest known living person in North America.</p> <p>Naomi Whitehead attained that status after the 22 October death of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/26/oldest-american-longevity">Elizabeth Francis</a>, 115, a Louisiana native who moved to Houston and was the world’s third-oldest person, according to the <a href="https://longeviquest.com/2024/07/americas-oldest-person-elizabeth-francis-turns-115/">LongeviQuest</a> website, an authority on supercentenarians – those who are 110 or older.</p> <p>Two pieces of advice attributed to Francis and widely circulated after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/26/oldest-american-longevity">her last birthday</a> in July were “if the Lord gave it to you, use it” and “speak your mind, don’t bite your tongue.”</p> <p>For her part, besides abstaining from smoking and imbibing, Whitehead has credited her longevity to good genes; her father lived to his 90s. She also suggested to LongeviQuest that cooking, baking, drawing, listening to music and other hobbies have all helped her become the world’s seventh-oldest known living person as of Tuesday.</p> <p>Whitehead <a href="https://www.ncnewsonline.com/news/lifestyles/113-birthdays-supercentenarian-born-in-1910-still-enjoys-life/article_0c08d9b8-f058-51b0-9223-a282053610dd.html">told</a> Pennsylvania’s New Caste News for her 113th birthday that she was born in Georgia on 26 September 1910 on a farm where she later helped relatives pick cotton and reap tobacco.
