<p>A former director of the Australian crypto company Blockchain Global, which collapsed owing creditors $58m, has been banned from leaving the country.</p> <p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission secured the interim travel ban in the federal court on 20 February after successfully arguing the director, Liang “Allan” Guo, posed a flight risk.</p> <p>Guo, who is a Chinese citizen, has been ordered to hand over to the court any passports in his possession.</p> <p>The hearing was held in Guo’s absence, so he did not immediately have the chance to respond to the judgment.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Guo, along with fellow directors Sam Lee and Ryan Xu, were referred by liquidators to Asic for alleged potential breaches of the Corporations Act.

He has not responded to the charges.</p> <p>In the federal court judgment published on Wednesday, Justice Button agreed to impose the ban on Guo leaving Australia until 20 August, saying the allegations against him were “very serious”.</p> <p>These included allegedly transferring investor funds for personal benefit.</p> <p>“Asic has also noted that, during his directorship, Mr Guo transferred $2.6 million out of a bank account holding investor funds, some of which was applied to his personal home loan account and his personal bank account,” the judgment said.</p> <p>“Asic has also referred to Mr Guo retaining 23.11 bitcoins, said to be worth approximately $1.8 million, which were the property of Blockchain Global and having transferred them into a cryptocurrency wallet controlled by Mr Guo on 8 December 2019.”</p> <p>Asic argued that given the other directors of Blockchain Global had left Australia soon after its collapse, Guo was “the only person closely involved with the affairs of Blockchain Global who remains in Australia”.</p> <p>“Asic anticipates that interviewing or examining Mr Guo will be critical to Asic pursuing the investigation, which it anticipates may culminate in the referral of a brief of evidence to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions,” the judgment stated.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/04/asic-faces-questions-over-failure-to-warn-consumers-about-hyperverse-crypto-scheme">Asic faces questions over failure to warn consumers about HyperVerse crypto scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the judgment, Asic anticipates it will take 12 months to investigate and deliver a brief of evidence to the DPP.</p> <p>In his reasons, Button commented on the apparent delay to Asic’s investigation, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/22/asic-examines-collapsed-bitcoin-company-blockchain-global-after-guardian-investigation">which was launched on 16 January after Guardian Australia’s investigation</a> into HyperVerse.</p> <p>“It is not apparent why the investigation was commenced when it was, given when Blockchain Global failed.
