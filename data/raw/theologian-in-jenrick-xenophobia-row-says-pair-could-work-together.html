<p>The theologian who accused Robert Jenrick of xenophobia on the BBC has invited the shadow justice minister to work with him to ease tensions over migration rather than “ramping up anti-immigrant sentiment”.</p> 
<p>Dr Krish Kandiah’s comments on Radio 4’s Thought for the Day, raising concerns about Jenrick’s remarks about the safety of his daughters because of small boat arrivals, caused a row after a complaint from the shadow justice secretary, with the item <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/13/bbc-apologises-thought-for-the-day-xenophobia-claim-robert-jenrick">being retrospectively edited</a> by the BBC.</p> 
<p>Kandiah expressed concern about the current atmosphere relating to migration and said he was extending an olive branch to Jenrick in the hope the two men could work together on the issue.</p> 
<p>The initial remarks by Kandiah, who heads the Sanctuary Foundation refugee charity, prompted an angry response from Jenrick. The BBC said it had removed “some of the language used” by Kandiah from a version of Thought for the Day posted online, saying it was not appropriate for the faith-based radio segment.</p> 
<p>In his statement, Kandiah said: “Mr Jenrick, I want your daughters and mine to be able to walk down the road safely and without fear. I worked with you when you were housing minister and the UK welcomed over 200,000 people from Hong Kong.</p> 
<p>“I was grateful for your support and compassion during that time. I would love to find a way we could work together to de-escalate the fear and anger many are feeling in our country. I believe we need to focus on the real challenges that are making people worried – housing, jobs and the cost of living – rather than ramping up anti-immigrant sentiment.”</p>

<p>In last weekend’s Mail on Sunday, Jenrick cited a series of recent crimes he said had been committed by asylum seekers, writing: “When I see these stories, I can’t help but think that it could have been one of my three young daughters. I certainly don’t want my children to share a neighbourhood with immigrant men with backward views who broke into Britain illegally, and about whom we know next to nothing.”</p> 
<p>In his Thought for the Day contribution, Kandiah quoted this passage from Jenrick, adding: “These words echo a fear many have absorbed. Fear of the stranger. The technical name for this is xenophobia.”</p> 
<p>While the government has not criticised Jenrick’s tone, and say the current row is a matter for the BBC, some MPs and others have said Kandiah’s description was accurate.</p> 
<p>The Labour MP John McDonnell said: “Jenrick has become the byword for political opportunism. There is no prejudice he won’t pander to and no harm to our community he won’t risk to further his political career.”</p> 
<p>Siân Berry, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion and a former co-leader of the party, condemned Jenrick for his comments and the government for not speaking out against them.</p> 
<p>“It is 100% xenophobia, drawing on stereotypes to create unnecessary and inaccurate fears,” she said. “If you can’t call that xenophobic or racist without the person in question kicking off at you, then I don’t know what we’ve learned from the last 80 years.</p> 
<p>“Robert Jenrick knows exactly what he’s doing when he is pushing these buttons, and he does need to be called out on it by everybody possible. I’m daily frustrated by the fact that the Labour government is playing along and not standing up for real British values.</p> 
<p>“What is [a] Labour government for if it isn’t to create a political discourse that backs up what British values really stand for. We’re not a country that rejects immigrants in the way that some people on the right and the far right would like us to.”</p>

<p>Jacqueline McKenzie, the head of immigration and asylum at Leigh Day solicitors, called Jenrick’s comments “appalling”. She said: “Not only are his comments xenophobic and without substance, but this is the sort of language that fuels racist tension in an otherwise cohesive society and causes the sorts of attacks on migrants and those who work with them as we are now seeing, and which fans the flames which led to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/26/two-in-five-arrested-for-last-summers-uk-riots-had-been-reported-for-domestic-abuse">last summer’s riots</a>.</p> 
<p>“It is irresponsible for a senior member of the opposition to make such statements. Whereas there are a few high profile cases of asylum seekers who have been arrested for sexual offences, this is not at all representative of those who claim asylum, the vast majority of whom go on to prove that they have fled persecution.”</p> 
<p>Jenrick’s office has been contacted for comment.</p>
