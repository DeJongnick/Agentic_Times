<p>China’s economy grew by 5% in 2024, in line with government targets but at the slowest rate since 1990 outside the Covid pandemic, according to official data.</p> <p>Growth accelerated through the year, with an expansion of 5.4% in the final quarter, up from 4.6% in the third quarter, according to Beijing’s National Bureau of Statistics.</p> <p>The bureau reported “steady progress amid stability” but pointed to a “complicated and severe environment with increasing external pressures and internal difficulties”.</p> <p>The statistics bureau said the economy had “recovered remarkably” in the latter part of 2024, after the government announced a series of stimulus measures. These included interest rate cuts, as well as a trade-in scheme for consumer goods, and tax incentives for property purchases.</p> <p>Across 2024 as a whole, industrial output was up by 5.8%, helped by a strong performance in manufacturing, but retail sales increased by only 3.5%, despite policies aimed at stimulating domestic demand.</p> <p>Beijing has been attempting to rebalance growth away from a heavy dependence on exports, towards domestic consumption. However, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/26/china-new-measures-housing-slump-growth">property downturn</a>, and the after-effects of the Covid pandemic, appear to have continued to weigh on sentiment.</p> <p>Lynn Song, a China economist at ING, said: “The key question is if we can see consumer confidence bottom out and begin a meaningful recovery. Pessimism has grown quite entrenched as of late, and it will take a lot of effort to break out of the doldrums.”</p> <p>Some commentators have raised concerns about the accuracy of China’s economic data, given the political nature of the way the statistics are reported.</p> <p>China is expected to be hit hardest by the tariffs threatened by Donald Trump. The incoming US president, who will be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/17/watch-trump-inauguration-time">inaugurated on Monday</a>, has suggested he could slap an across-the-board 60% tax on all Chinese imports.</p> <p>Some US companies have been stepping up imports from China in recent months, in an attempt to outrun the tariffs – although it is unclear whether Trump’s plans will be put into effect immediately.</p> <p>Sam Jochim, an economist at EFG Asset Management, said: “Export growth was strong in Q4 [the fourth quarter], reflecting a front-loading of orders from the US in preparation for Trump tariffs.</p> <p>“There was an associated rise in manufacturing output but clearly, if all else remains equal, these drivers of growth will find it difficult to sustain this momentum in 2025.”</p>
