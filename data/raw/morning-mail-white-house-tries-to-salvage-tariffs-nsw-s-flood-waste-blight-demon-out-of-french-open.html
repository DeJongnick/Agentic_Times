<p>Morning everyone. Donald Trump is asking the US supreme court to save his beloved tariffs from so-called “activist judges” in a US trade court who have ruled his big tariffs policy is illegal. We have the latest from Washington.</p> 
<p>At home, the government says preparation for the social media ban on teenagers is “broadly on track” but we have inside word about concerns about gaps in the testing. We look at the big, mouldy problem of waste left after the New South Wales floods, and the Demon crashes out in a Paris five-setter.</p>
