<p>He is the democratic socialist who has been described as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/us/politics/mamdani-trump-republicans.html">a gift to the Republican party</a>.</p> <p>Zohran Mamdani’s stunning showing in the Democratic primary election for mayor of New York this week was seen by some as perfect fodder to whip up a new “red scare”. Donald Trump called him “a 100% Communist Lunatic”, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114745583467776157">writing on social media</a>: “We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous.”</p> <p>But at a gathering of religious conservatives in Washington on Friday, the first attendee interviewed by the Guardian expressed admiration for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/25/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-election-democrats">what Mamdani had pulled off</a> in beating establishment favorite Andrew Cuomo.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/28/hot-commie-summer-zohran-mamdani">Wall Street shivers over ‘hot commie summer’ after Mamdani’s success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kevin Abplanalp, who has worked on political campaigns, said: “He ran a fantastic ground game. I was very impressed with his grassroots work. Cuomo was a terrible candidate so it’s a combination of a repudiation of Cuomo and excitement over a younger guy with energy and different ideas<em>.”</em></p> <p>Abplanalp, 49, executive director of the group <a href="https://coalitionforliberty.com/">Coalition for Liberty</a>, added: “He’s a bit too socialistic for my taste but it is New York. They’ve had Marxists before. It is what it is.<em>”</em></p> <p>Mamdani was endorsed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a leading progressive some believe could now be encouraged to mount a bid for the White House in 2028. But that prospect was met with complacency and ridicule at the Freedom &amp; Faith Coalition’s <a href="https://www.ffcoalition.com/about/road-to-majority/">Road to Majority conference</a>.</p> <p>Abplanalp commented: “That is hilarious. I don’t think she has the requisite experience. We’ve had other presidents who don’t have the requisite experience: Jimmy Carter for one. Do people want to have another train wreck of someone that just talks a good game? There’s nothing on her résumé that screams executive capability.”</p> <p>The annual gathering was addressed by senators from Pennsylvania, Ohio and Oklahoma along with Virginia’a governor, Glenn Youngkin, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jun/27/donald-trump-big-beautiful-bill-reworked-senate-us-politics-latest-updates-news?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-685ee3b08f080e77497129ef#block-685ee3b08f080e77497129ef">Trump’s border “czar”, Tom Homan</a>. In the eyes of many delegates, Mamdani’s surprise victory was evidence of liberal eccentricity in New York that will not fly elsewhere.</p> <p>Andrea Moore, 55, from Virginia, said: <em>“</em>I’m a little surprised but at the same time it is New York<em>.”</em> She told an anecdote about an Uber driver who was upset about New York potentially giving people who illegally crossed the border “$2,000 a month of taxpayer money and the right to vote immediately”.</p> <p>As for Ocasio-Cortez running for president, she remarked: “I don’t think I’d fear it but I’d probably laugh about it.”</p> <p>Steven Perkins, 74, who is retired and from South Dakota, said: “It’s not just that we’re conservatives but we know our communities. You get out of the big core cities and people are pretty conservative and traditional and they aren’t ready for all of this much change to occur. There’s this big reaction. The Democrats better wake up.”</p> <p>Mamdani, 33, combined charisma and social media savvy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2025/jun/27/a-socialist-underdog-makes-history-in-new-york-podcast">with a policy agenda</a> focused on New York’s affordability crisis. His plans include freezing rent for many residents, free bus service and universal childcare paid for by new taxes on the wealthy.</p> <p>Some at the Road to Majority conference found this affront to capitalism. Darin Moser, 56, from Mount Airy, North Carolina, said: <em>“</em>It’s very concerning. The United States was built on freedom and free markets and we need to stay on that because that’s what’s made us successful and the most successful nation in the world.”</p> <p>One attendee, who did not wish to be named, blamed the media for making socialism seem like the answer to their problems. He said: “If you repeat anything enough times people are going to believe it but it’s not been proven. Socialism or communism has proven to fail every time it’s been put into play. It comes around newly clothed but it’s the same worn-out policy.”</p> <p>The ascent of Mamdani, who would be New York’s first Muslim mayor, triggered an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/zohran-mamdani-faces-islamophobic-attacks">onslaught of Islamaphobic attacks</a> across social media, including from some Republican members of Congress. Centrist Democrats remained nervous about backing him, fearful that he could damage the party in swing states.</p> <p>But in the view of Ronald Wilcox, 63, from Fairfax county in Virginia, Democrats have already embraced extremism and lost touch with reality. “The left has no limit to what they will vote for,” he said. “I trust no Democrat because there’s no limit to how bad a person can be and they’ll still support him.”</p> <p>Could the US ever elect a socialist president? Wilcox, who works in direct mail, replied: “I won’t say never but the mood of America, the new generation, is embracing Trump. The young generation is moving to conservative, the Asians are moving to conservative, the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/06/26/behind-trumps-2024-victory-a-more-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-voter-coalition/">Latinos are moving to conservative</a> because we share their values.”</p>
