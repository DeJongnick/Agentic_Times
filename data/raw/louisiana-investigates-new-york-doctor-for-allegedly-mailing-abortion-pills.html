<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana">Louisiana</a> is investigating a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> doctor over accusations that she mailed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion">abortion</a> pills into the state, Liz Murrill, the state attorney general, said on Monday. The case marks the second investigation into the doctor, Margaret Carpenter, whom Louisiana had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/31/new-york-louisiana-abortion-pill-charges">indicted earlier this year</a> for allegedly prescribing abortions pills via telehealth to a Louisiana resident.</p> <p>“The young woman was 20 weeks pregnant,” Murrill said. “She and her boyfriend after she gave birth took the baby, wrapped it in a towel and threw it in a garbage can.”</p> <p>Murrill said that police in Shreveport, where the abortion allegedly took place, were investigating the incident alongside her office. A spokesperson for Murrill’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment or documentation of the case.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/31/new-york-louisiana-abortion-pill-charges">New York doctor indicted in Louisiana over alleged abortion pill prescription</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The couple ultimately went to the hospital, according to Murrill. Medical experts widely agree that it is safe to “self-manage” your own abortion using pills in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/28/arizona-abortion-clinic">these pills can also safely induce</a> an abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy. Doctors Without Borders offers <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/faq-safe-abortion-care">guidelines</a> on how to use abortion pills through 22 weeks of pregnancy.</p> <p>Murrill made the comments while speaking at a state legislative hearing about a bill that would allow people to sue an individual or an entity that “performs, causes or substantially facilitates” an abortion. Louisiana already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/29/abortion-laws-bans-by-state">bans virtually all abortions</a>.</p> <p>“This bill provides for civil liability and allows another mechanism – it is another tool in the toolbox for people who are harmed by somebody who is intent on violating our laws,” Murrill said.</p> <p>Carpenter has so far avoided making public statements in the case. An organization that she co-founded, Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>“Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we’ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women’s rights,” the organization said in a statement when news of the first Louisiana case against Carpenter broke. “It’s no secret that the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/new-york-abortion-pill-lawsuit-texas-fine">New York clerk refuses to enforce Texas effort to punish abortion provider</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jeff Landry, Louisiana’s Republican governor, has signed an extradition warrant for<strong> </strong>Carpenter, but she has not been extradited to Louisiana and New York’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/13/texas-abortion-pills-shield-laws-new-york-doctor">vowed to never sign</a> an extradition order for her. New York is one of a handful of blue states that, in the wake of the fall of Roe v Wade, have enacted so-called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/26/abortion-clinic-pills-shield-laws">“shield laws”</a>, which guard abortion providers such as Carpenter against out-of-state prosecutions and civil lawsuits. In spring 2024, such shield laws helped facilitate more than 7,700 monthly abortions in states with total or six-week abortion bans, according to #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning.</p> <p>Texas has also sued Carpenter for allegedly mailing abortion pills into the state, in defiance of its abortion bans, but a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/new-york-abortion-pill-lawsuit-texas-fine">New York clerk has rejected a Texas request</a> to force Carpenter to pay a fine. Legal analysts expect the issue to wind up in front of the US supreme court.</p>
