<p>By 2030, the UK is set to become a “super-ageing society” with one in five people over the age of 65, and there is growing concern about how our elderly population will be impacted by the housing crisis.</p> <p>With rent soaring and home ownership out of reach for many, there are fears elderly people will increasingly be forced to live in homes they struggle to afford, that are unsuitable for their physical needs, or which exacerbate loneliness in their later years. </p> <p>Research from Crisis has found nearly one in five people said they wanted to retire but couldn’t because of their housing costs, and the number of older people in England facing homelessness has rising by over 50% over the last five years. </p> <p>We would like to hear from people over 65 about their experiences of the housing crisis. For instance, are you at risk of homelessness, or have been made homeless, due to rising living costs? Are you stuck in an unsuitable home but financially or physically unable to move? </p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="da49b24c-3fca-4a8f-b5b8-a0c3f1526f4c" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>
