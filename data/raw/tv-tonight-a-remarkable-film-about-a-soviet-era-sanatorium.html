<h2>Storyville: Sanatorium</h2> <p><strong>10pm, BBC Four</strong><strong><br></strong>A remarkable film recorded over the course of a summer at Kuyalnik sanatorium in Odesa. Despite the conflict in Ukraine, the war is a background presence. Instead, this has the feel of a Wes Anderson film: a vast, sprawling, anachronistic Soviet relic surrounded by allegedly life-giving mud, and boasting the kind of equipment that would have been state of the art 100 years ago. An atmospheric piece that will linger in the memory. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Ambulance</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>A surprisingly lovely start to the new series of the Bafta-winning ambulance show, with call handler Ellie directing a man to deliver his wife’s baby. It’s in Yorkshire this time, and things quickly worsen on the Saturday night shift, with an 80-year-old who has a bad fall and a man with a mental health crisis. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>TikTok: Murder Gone Viral</h2> <p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong><strong><br></strong>After 17-year-old Charlie Cosser was murdered at a party in 2023, his father, Martin, turned to TikTok as an outlet for his grief. His raw videos reached millions, while the family’s charity, Charlie’s Promise, used social media to educate young people on knife crime prevention. A compelling defence for TikTok as a surprisingly effective tool for positive change. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Murder Before Evensong</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong></p>    <p>As permanently vexed vicar Canon Daniel Clement (Matthew Lewis) continues to ponder over his village’s numerous murder suspects, the women in his life push the case forward, using classic cosy-crime methods. His mother, Audrey (Amanda Redman), finds info via forthright gossiping, while organist Jane (Nina Toussaint-White) digs up a secret thanks to some clumsy vacuuming. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Film Club</h2> <p><strong>10pm, BBC Three</strong><strong><br></strong>Will movie nerds Evie (Aimee Lou Wood) and Noa (Nabhaan Rizwan) get their happy ending? It’s the final double bill of Wood’s charming will-they won’t-they comedy drama, and Noa says goodbye to Evie as he leaves for his new job. But luckily dream team mum Suz (Suranne Jones) and sister Izzie (Liv Hill) try to knock some sense into the pair. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>In My Own Words: Frederick Forsyth</h2> <p><strong>10.40pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>“If the bastards didn’t get me with that, they’ll never get me.” So speaks the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/09/frederick-forsyth-obituary">Day of the Jackal author</a> in this posthumous interview show, as he presents the bullet that whizzed through his hair during the Biafran war. It’s an entertaining romp through a life in which he was an RAF pilot, a BBC reporter, an MI6 informant – and a millionaire thriller writer. <em>Alexi Duggins</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Champions League football: Arsenal v Atlético Madrid, </strong><strong>6.30pm, Prime Video</strong><strong> </strong>Villarreal v Manchester City is on TNT Sports 1 at 7.45pm.</p>
