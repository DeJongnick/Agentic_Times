<p>I am pleased that Richard Tice enjoys the church and believes in God (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/31/richard-tice-church-archbishop-criticism-reform-immigration-policy">Richard Tice hits back at C of E criticism of Reform immigration policy, 31 August</a>)<strong> </strong>but I would advise him to read his Bible a little more carefully. If he did so he would discover that those of faith are continually reminded to “show hospitality to strangers” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013%3A2&amp;version=NIV">(Hebrews 13:2)</a> and “to provide the poor wanderer with shelter” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2058%3A7&amp;version=NIV">(Isaiah 58:7)</a>. There are at least 30 verses in the Bible that encourage us to look after those seeking&nbsp;refuge.</p> <p>The problem Mr Tice faces is that the Bible is a very political book. It being so, he cannot be surprised that our archbishop is commenting on his party’s plans to deport asylum seekers who arrive in small boats. As Christians, we are called to love each other and to offer help to those who&nbsp;are&nbsp;suffering.</p> <p>I would be happy to welcome Mr&nbsp;Tice to our church should he wish&nbsp;to learn more about&nbsp;the&nbsp;Christian faith.<br><strong>Rev Richard Stainer</strong><br><em>Bradfield St George, Suffolk</em></p> <p>• The archbishop of York is right to call Reform UK’s immigration proposals short-term and isolationist. But words aren’t enough – the church must offer practical alternatives.</p> <p>One possibility is staring us in the face: our half-empty churches and cathedrals. These buildings have vast unused space, often with soaring ceilings. With modular pods or mezzanine units, living quarters could be installed above while worship continues below.</p> <p>This would reduce reliance on hotels (saving the taxpayer millions), provide dignified accommodation and give historic buildings a renewed community purpose. Above all, it would embody the Christian principle of sanctuary in a way that is visible, practical and desperately needed.<br><strong>Sal Mansfield</strong><br><em>Pill, Somerset</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
