<p>The line between work and play often blurs where I live in Boulder, Colorado. As an outdoor writer who hikes just about every day, I regularly go straight from the trail to a cafe to work or meet with a friend, so apparel that performs well <em>and</em> looks nice in social settings is what I wear much of the time.</p> <p>The most versatile outdoor clothing is subtle with its branding and has simple, classic designs that don’t make it look like performance gear. I’ve rounded up the fall apparel pieces that have passed muster both indoors and out, tested by myself and my equally adventurous husband.</p> <h2>Royal Robbins El Cap Canvas Shacket</h2>    <p>For cold-weather outdoor adventures, I don’t leave the house without warm outerwear that helps me hike comfortably for as long as I’d like. This Royal Robbins shirt-jacket feels like a cozy hug thanks to the quilted insulation in its sleeves, and luxuriously soft sherpa liner.</p> <p>The canvas outer shell is classic and understated with simple metal snaps and deep pockets that have both top and side entry points. I love how I can drop my phone in the top, and slide my hands in the sides. I can wear this stylish-yet-functional shacket from trail to coffee shop and not feel schlubby.</p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.zappos.com/p/womens-royal-robbins-el-cap-canvas-shacket-saddle/product/10005354/color/616" > $135 at Zappos </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.royalrobbins.com/us/en-us/women/outerwear/jackets/ws-el-cap-canvas-shacket/" > $150 at Royal Robbins </a>  <h2>Danner Overlook Primaloft Jacket</h2>    <p>My husband, Rob, does not consider himself an extreme outdoor athlete by any means, and he has no desire to dress like one. This quilted men’s jacket from Danner goes with nearly any outfit, making it ideal for spontaneous nature walks between meetings (which we do often). The fabric is tough, water-resistant, and stretchy so it moves nicely on quick hikes. On chilly fall days where the weather isn’t quite cold enough for winterwear, the Overlook works as a packable outer layer that protects against nippy breezes without looking like a puffy.</p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.danner.com/overlook-thermal-shirt-black-m.html" > $280 at Danner </a>  <h2>Fjallraven Women’s Övik Lite Knit Sweater</h2>    <p>It’s been my experience that sweaters are often too heavy, hot and itchy for hiking, but Fjallraven’s Övik has proven to be the exception. Lightweight with a fine waffle knit, it provides just the right amount of warmth for cool-weather outings when the sun is hiding behind clouds. As someone who sweats easily, I especially love that the Övik doesn’t smell funky during or after my outdoor excursions; I can thank the merino wool (famously anti-odor) for this.</p> <p>With its cute design and autumnal color, no one would guess that this sweater was made by an outdoor clothing company. The only visible branding is a teeny Swedish flag tab on the hip and a dime-sized leather fox-face logo stitched on to one sleeve, both easy to miss.</p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.fjallraven.com/us/en-us/women/tops/sweaters-knitwear/ovik-lite-knit-sweater-w/" > $165 at Fjallraven </a>  <h2>Royal Robbins Men’s Vogelsang</h2>    <p>A plaid flannel shirt is a fall staple, and Royal Robbins has really dialed this one in for both outdoor and indoor wear. The Vogelsang is lightweight and well-fitting on my husband’s tall frame – not baggy or boxy in the slightest. While long-sleeved shirts tend to heat up quickly over the course of a brisk hike, Rob appreciates the warm yet breathable nature of this flannel’s fabric, which has stayed surprisingly soft after multiple wears and washes. Despite being a “performance tech flannel”, the Vogelsang’s attractive pattern and flattering fit make it blend in nicely at social and professional events.</p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.alpineshopvt.com/royal-robbins-mens-vogelsang-l-s/" > $99 at Alpine Shop </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.royalrobbins.com/us/en-us/men/tops/shirts/ms-vogelsang-ls/?" > $100 at Royal Robbins </a>  <h2>Black Diamond Women’s Dogma Pants</h2>    <p>It’s not easy to find women’s pants that are well suited for both outdoor activities and social events; nearly all of my hiking pants make me look like a backpacking guide. But the Black Diamond Dogma Pants look trendy <em>and</em> are tough as nails. A straight-leg pant cropped just above the ankle, the Dogma’s cotton canvas material is not only soft enough to be comfortably worn all day, it’s thick and stretchy – perfect for a wide range of motion (with no fear of ripping).</p> <p>They’re great all-around outdoor bottoms that are game for anything. And because they look like a pair of everyday pants, I can confidently wear them around town, too.</p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://blackdiamondequipment.com/products/womens-dogma-pants?variant=50472526577981&amp;country=US" > $129 at Black Diamond </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.backcountry.com/b/black-diamond-dogma-pant-womens" > $129 at Backcountry </a>  <h2>Prana Men’s Brion Pant</h2>    <p>These are, no exaggeration, my husband’s favorite pair of pants that he’s ever owned. The Brion Pant’s soft, ultra-stretchy material keeps legs warm in cooler weather and accommodates nearly any activity. Rob has biked, hiked, backpacked and rock-scrambled in these Prana pants, and they haven’t slowed him down one bit.</p> <p>Aside from their excellent performance features, they boast an exceptional fit and attractive design that make them a great choice for work, parties, or everyday errands. While wearing them on a walk through town, Rob had a woman run over to ask where he got them so she could buy a pair for her husband – the ultimate compliment.</p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.6pm.com/p/mens-prana-brion-pants-ii-sandbar/product/9611384/color/13835" > $25.48 at 6pm </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.prana.com/p/brion-pant/2056951.html" > $85 at PrAna </a>  <h2>Teva Ellwood Mid Hiking Shoe</h2>    <p>Rob and I both own a pair of Teva’s Ellwood shoes and agree that they keep our feet warm, dry and comfortable on the trail without having the typical rugged hiking boot look. These boots have proven themselves over and over on camping trips, walks through town, and dinners at casual restaurants.</p>    <p>The tan color palette gives them a subtle, all-purpose look while the grippy outsole and waterproof fabric have performed well in every kind of weather (even light snow). It’s this versatility that makes them our favorite shoe on days where we go straight from outdoor adventures to dining out.</p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0CP4HRYX4" > $65.17 at Amazon </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.teva.com/sale/ellwood-mid-hiking-shoe/197634263359.html" > $83.99 at Teva </a>  <p>***</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Paige Triola is a freelance writer based in Boulder, Colorado.
