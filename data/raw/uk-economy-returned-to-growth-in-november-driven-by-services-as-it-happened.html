 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>European shares are rallying for a second day, partly boosted by luxury stocks after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/jan/16/uk-economy-forecast-to-have-returned-to-growth-in-november-business-live?page=with:block-6788e2228f08769d890efd01#block-6788e2228f08769d890efd01">strong results from Switzerland’s </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/jan/16/uk-economy-forecast-to-have-returned-to-growth-in-november-business-live?page=with:block-6788e2228f08769d890efd01#block-6788e2228f08769d890efd01">Richemont</a></strong>.</p> 
  <p>This lifted shares of other luxury goods makers such as <strong>LVMH</strong> and <strong>Kering</strong> in France, and the UK’s <strong>Burberry</strong>. The French stock market is the standout performer, rising by 2.09%. In London, the FTSE 100 index is 70 points or 0.85% ahead at 8,371.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, Wall Street has dipped after strong gains yesterday, and following a slightly disappointing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/jan/16/uk-economy-forecast-to-have-returned-to-growth-in-november-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67890c268f088775fe77a604#block-67890c268f088775fe77a604">rise in US retail sales</a>.</p>

  <p>The rise in activity will be welcomed by the Treasury, as it shows the economy expanded after the budget at the end of October.</p> 
  <p>But growth was slower than expected. City economists had forecast that GDP would rise by 0.2% in November, with some warning that November’s growth was weak, making an interest rate cut by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor">Bank of England</a> next month more likely. Markets are estimating an 82% chance of a cut on 6 February, and have fully priced two cuts this year.</p> 
  <p>In the three months to the end of November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy showed no growth, as GDP fell by 0.1% in September and October.</p> 
  <p>The pound fell by nearly 0.4% to $1.2191.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Ryanair</strong> has decided to eliminate 12 routes and 800,000 seats from its Spain summer schedule this year.</p> 
  <p>It is ceasing operations at two airports and reducing them at another five, citing “excessive fees” applied by Spain’s airport authority Aena, which it accused of a “monopoly”. The budget airline is cutting 800,000 passenger seats overall, reducing its capacity in Spain by almost a fifth.</p> 
  <p>The company’s chief executive, <strong>Eddie Wilson</strong>, said at a press conference that Aena’s measures are “ineffective” and do not support the government’s objectives of getting more traffic at Spain’s regional airports, <a href="https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/holiday/airport/2025/01/16/130503/mallorca-spain-tourism-ryanair-grounds-spain-routes-over-excessive-airport-taxes-800-000-seats-scrapped-for-this-summer.html">according to Majorca Daily Bulletin</a>.</p> 
  <p>Ryanair has decided to stop flying from Jerez (Cádiz) in southern Spain and Valladolid in the north west. It will withdraw an aircraft based at Santiago de Compostela, and also reduce flights at Vigo, Santiago, Zaragoza, Asturias and Santander.</p>

  <p>Here is our analysis of today’s UK economic growth data from our economics correspondent Richard Partington.</p> 
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/16/pressure-eases-on-rachel-reeves-as-uk-economy-grows-by-01-in-november">A return to economic growth</a>, better-than-expected <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/15/surprise-fall-in-uk-inflation-to-25-eases-pressure-on-rachel-reeves">inflation figures</a>, and breathing room in the bond markets. After a difficult start to the year for Rachel Reeves, there are at last a handful of positives to cling on to.</strong></p> 
  <p>For the chancellor, however, she will know talking up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/15/vadera-green-shoots-recovery">a few green shoots</a> of economic recovery would be a dangerous game. The broad story from the economy is it continues to be flat, having eked out modest growth in November after two small monthly falls in output.</p> 
  <p>It’s hardly surprising Reeves says she is “determined to go further and faster to kickstart economic growth”. Growth of 0.1% in November is unlikely to be enough to avoid stagnation in the fourth quarter. After a similar performance in the third quarter, it lays the ground for an entire half-year without any progress on Labour’s primary mission. Combined with inflation sticking above the Bank of England’s 2% target, a period of “stagflation” beckons.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Fall in UK trade with EU should spur rewrite of post-Brexit rules, says IPPR</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A slump in trade with the EU should spur ministers to negotiate a fundamental rewrite of post-Brexit rules to more closely align the UK with Brussels, a leading left-of-centre thinktank has said.</p> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s arrival in the White House next week should also encourage the government to get on the front foot in trade agreement talks with the US to support the growth of UK exports, said the <strong>Institute for Public Policy Research</strong> (IPPR).</p> 
  <p>In a report revealing the full extent of the decline in Britain’s trading position that has been inherited by the Labour government, the IPPR said ministers needed to consider a wide range of measures to give industries – including energy, defence, food, communications, healthcare and pharmaceuticals – a better chance of selling products and services overseas.</p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">

  </aside> 
  <p>The report said UK trade policy had been “muddled” and “rudderless” since the 2016 Brexit vote, adding that since leaving the EU single market and customs union in 2021, efforts to strike mini-deals with non-EU countries had run their course.</p> 
  <p>Estimates suggest that compared with staying inside Europe’s free trade zone, UK goods exports to the EU between 2021 and 2023 were down by 27% while EU goods imports to the UK were down by 32%, the report said.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, other G7 countries including the US, Japan, France and Italy enjoyed a boom in trade. The UK experienced a 10% decline in total goods trade from 2019 to the end of 2023. Figures from 2019 to the end of the third quarter of 2023 show other G7 countries saw an average 5% increase.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s inauguration next week could usher in a series of restrictive policies by Washington that prove to be a turning point in global trade policy. The incoming US president has said he wants to increase the cost to US consumers of imported goods that he alleges benefit from subsidies. China is his main target, but businesses based in the EU and UK could also be caught by tariffs charged by US customs and passed on to consumers.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> and <strong>Bank of America</strong> have reported bumper profits, following a wave of dealmaking in their investment banking divisions.</p> 
  <p>Morgan Stanley made a profit of $3.7bn in the fourth quarter of last year, up from $1.5bn a year earlier. Its investment banking revenue climbed by 25% to $1.6bn, mirroring strong results at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, out yesterday.</p> 
  <p>Bank of America posted a profit of $6.7bn for October to December, up from $3.1bn.</p> 
  <p>Wall Street banks have benefited from a jump in mergers and acquisitions that boosted investment banking fees, on the back of a strong US economy, interest rate cuts and expectations of lighter regulations under incoming president <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Banks have also cashed in on rallying stock markets, which encouraged public listings and stock sales.</p>

  <p><strong>UK banks are predicting that demand for mortgages will slow in the first quarter of this year.</strong></p> 
  <p>The Bank of England’s latest Credit Conditions report, released this morning, shows that lenders expect demand for secured lending for house purchases, and for remortgaging, to decrease in the January-March quarter.</p> 
  <p>That would follow increases in October-December.</p> 
  <p><strong>Simon Gammon</strong>, managing partner at <strong>Knight Frank Finance</strong>, says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“Clearly, the lenders think that the beginning of 2025 will be another period of sluggish activity in the housing market. As things stand, this is likely to prove true. On Wednesday afternoon, two large lenders said they would increase the cost of some mortgage products - the first of the major lenders to do so since the latest round of bond market volatility.</p> 
   <p>“That will probably prompt others to follow, which will be disappointing for anybody seeking to purchase or remortgage a home in the months ahead. That said, fairly positive inflation data from both the UK in and the US this week has calmed bond markets, which suggests we’ll see a swift repricing, rather than weeks of sustained increases in mortgage rates.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Reeves to meet regulators</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> is expected to pile pressure on UK regulators to do more to support growth when she summons bosses to No 11 on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>The chief executives of watchdogs including the Competition and Markets Authority, communications regulator Ofcom, water regulator Ofwat, and the energy regulator Ofgem, are due to meet the chancellor and business secretary <strong>Jonathan Reynolds</strong> in Downing Street, as they face accusations that their work has been presenting a barrier to investment.</p> 
  <p>The Office of Rail and Road, the Environment Agency and the Civil Aviation Authority are also due to appear at the midday meeting.</p> 
  <p>The meeting comes weeks after Reeves, Reynolds and prime minister <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> wrote to 17 of the UK’s regulators on Christmas Eve, ordering them to put forward pro-growth proposals. Thursday’s meeting is the first in a series of check-ins with those regulators, as the government reviews their plans and progress.</p> 
  <p>Ministers and officials across government will be engaging with other regulators, including the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority, about their proposals in the coming weeks.</p> 
  <p>But regulators were put on notice back in October, when Starmer<a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2024/oct/14/keir-starmer-promise-slash-red-tape-investment-summit"> used a speech at the government’s investment summit</a> to promise that he would “rip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment” and ensure that every regulator in the UK “takes growth as seriously as this room does.”</p> 
  <p>Reeves later told City bankers at the Mansion House dinner in November that post-financial crisis regulator<a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2024/nov/14/rules-imposed-after-financial-crisis-have-gone-too-far-reeves-tells-city-bankers"> had “gone too far”</a> and resulted in “unintended consequences, which we must now address.”</p>

  <p><strong>Simon Pittaway</strong>, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the GDP data was disappointing, raising fears of stagnation, despite a welcome return to growth.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>In recent years the UK has been a growth rollercoaster, with a recession in late 2023 followed by a bounce back in early 2024. But its longer-term record is one of economic stagnation, and that is where Britain risks returning to.</p> 
   <p>The paltry GDP growth late last year reinforces the need for the government’s economic plans to start bearing fruit.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Isaac Stell</strong>, investment manager at Wealth Club said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The UK economy spluttered back to life in November with growth of 0.1%, following two months of negative growth in September and October. The small amount of growth achieved in November will likely take further heat off a chancellor that has been under significant amounts of pressure over the last few weeks.</p> 
   <p>The latest figures will be welcomed by the government, however small they are, and when coupled with yesterday’s inflation undershoot provide a small glimmer of hope. However, Reeves and co will not want to hang out the bunting just yet as challenges certainly remain in the form of upside surprises to inflation and businesses having to shoulder significant rises in national insurance contributions come April. However, with an economy that is far from firing on all cylinders, and inflation, for the moment moderating, much needed rate cuts from the Bank of England look like a real possibility.</p>
