In fact, he used both words twice.</strong> But, when Beth Rigby asked if the claim was racist (because Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, is Muslim), Starmer just said it was nonsense.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Starmer also told Sky News that he had “no personal issue with Andy [Burnham] in the slightest” when asked by Sky’s Beth Rigby if he would prefer the Greater Manchester mayor to “just shut up”.</strong> Starmer’s allies were infuriated by Burnham’s interventions last week, and his suggestion that he would be available to replace Starmer as leader. But his apparent disloyalty triggered a backlash, and as the conference closes there is a consensus that Burnham overplayed his hand, and the threat he posed to Starmer has (at least temporarily) receded.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Keir Starmer has said he will look at how international law is being interpreted by British courts in an effort to tackle small boats, which he labelled “Farage boats” because of their increase in number since Brexit.</strong> Speaking after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> party conference, the prime minister signalled his unhappiness with how the European convention on human rights was being interpreted by judges making decisions about deportations.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A significant number of EU citizens living long term in the UK post <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum">Brexit</a> are experiencing discrimination in work and in public services, a report by the UK’s statutory Brexit watchdog has revealed.</strong> Five years after the UK quit the bloc, more than a third reported feeling discriminated against by public bodies.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Keir Starmer has arrived in Denmark ahead of a meeting with European leaders, as the Danish prime minister declared Europe is in a “hybrid war” with Russia. </strong>The prime minister touched down at Copenhagen Airport on Wednesday ahead of the European Political Community (EPC) summit on Thursday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Public support for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/idcards">digital IDs</a> has collapsed after Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/26/keir-starmer-digital-id-cards-enormous-opportunity-uk">announced plans</a> for their introduction, in what has been described as a symptom of the prime minister’s “reverse Midas touch”. </strong>Net support for digital ID cards fell from 35% in the early summer to -14% at the weekend after Starmer’s announcement, according to polling by More in Common.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Amnesty International UK has expressed concern about Keir Starmer’s comment, in an interview with the Today programme this morning, about wanting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/oct/01/keir-starmer-human-rights-law-echr-nigel-farage-small-boat-crossings">to review the way some human rights laws are interpreted in deportation cases</a>.</strong> He mentioned specifically articles 3 and 8 of the European convention on human rights, covering the right not to be tortured and the right to family life respectively.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A total of 134 people have been charged with an offence for allegedly showing support for the banned Palestine Action group in London, the Metropolitan Police have said, as it announced the latest 20 protesters who have been told they are to face court action. </strong>The 20 defendants, who were all arrested on 9 August, have been sent a formal charge summons in the post to appear in court, the force said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Selfridges has blamed a slump in the number of international tourists shopping for luxury goods in the UK and weaker consumer confidence for a fall in annual sales, as the retailer racked up losses for a fifth year in a row. </strong>The upmarket department store chain reported a 7% decline in sales in the 48 weeks to 4 January 2025 to £775m compared with £835m recorded over the 53 weeks of its previous year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The date of the unveiling of the Scottish budget could be brought forward by two days, the convener of Holyrood’s finance committee has said. </strong>Finance secretary Shona Robison had previously said she was “minded” to unveil her tax and spending plans on 15 January as a result of the UK government not unveiling its budget until the end of November, PA reported.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68dd4da48f08f91f2eb5d8b4" class="block"

The stakes are too high.” She added: “I won’t shy away from the difficult conversations, but I won’t snipe from the sidelines.”</p> <p>Asked what the government had got wrong, Phillipson, the MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, identified controversies over winter fuel payments and welfare policy, but said it was important to focus also on what had gone right.</p> <p>Powell blamed mistakes on “fewer and fewer people taking decisions that are not connected to the communities that we represent, and not hearing that feedback from the doorstep, from our workplaces”, saying this was having an impact on activists.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/01/uk-labour-party-members-lucy-powell-deputy-leadership-hustings">Labour members feel disconnected from government, says Lucy Powell</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68dd3fba8f08f91f2eb5d77d" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-01T15:01:33.707Z">4.01pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>A total of 134 people have been charged with an offence for allegedly showing support for the banned Palestine Action group in London, the Metropolitan Police have said, as it announced the latest 20 protesters who have been told they are to face court action.</strong></p> <p>The 20 defendants, who were all arrested on 9 August, have been sent a formal charge summons in the post to appear in court, the force said.</p> <p>They had been charged with an offence under section 13 of the Terrorism Act, 2000 and were due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 24 November.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68dd3db58f08694a84a03283" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-01T14:42:17.132Z">3.42pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Keir Starmer has arrived in Denmark ahead of a meeting with European leaders, as the Danish prime minister declared Europe is in a “hybrid war” with Russia.</strong></p> <p>The prime minister touched down at Copenhagen Airport on Wednesday ahead of the European Political Community (EPC) summit on Thursday.</p> <p>Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters on Wednesday that Europe is in the middle of a “hybrid war” waged by Russia and the continent must arm itself.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68dd39428f085e69f3ae08c2" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-01T14:23:50.475Z">3.23pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Ed Miliband announced on Wednesday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/01/fracking-ban-uk-labour-counter-reform-promise">that Labour is to speed up plans</a> to bring in a “total ban” on fracking.</strong> </p> <p>But how will this work and will it stop a future Reform government from fracking?</p> <p><em>Environment reporter <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helena-horton">Helena Horton</a> </strong>has this explainer:</em></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/01/labour-fracking-ban-end-practice-in-uk-for-good">Will Labour’s fracking ban end practice in the UK for good?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68dd31f98f085e69f3ae0828" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/eleni-courea"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-01T14:04:01.823Z">3.04pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Public support for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/idcards">digital IDs</a> has collapsed after Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/26/keir-starmer-digital-id-cards-enormous-opportunity-uk">announced plans</a> for their introduction, in what has been described as a symptom of the prime minister’s “reverse Midas touch”.</strong></p> <p>Net support for digital ID cards fell from 35% in the early summer to -14% at the weekend after Starmer’s announcement, according to polling by More in Common.</p> <p>The findings suggest that the proposal has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/27/britons-on-keir-starmer-plan-digital-id-cards">suffered considerably</a> from its association with an unpopular government.

The build-out of British wind and solar is helping insulate the UK against these price swings with electric heat pumps meaning we’re increasingly less dependent on foreign gas imports to heat our homes.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>From Bob Ward<strong>,</strong> policy and communications director at the <strong>Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment</strong> at the LSE</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The proposed new ban on fracking will just formalise the moratorium on fracking that was re-introduced by Rishi Sunak’s Government in 2022 after a report by the British Geological Survey concluded that it ‘can trigger earthquakes large enough to cause structural damage’.</p> <p>Although the exact extent of economically viable reserves of shale gas in the UK is not known with certainty, the most recent assessments suggest that there is unlikely to be enough to significantly affect international prices for natural gas, and so would not reduce prices for British consumers. </p> </blockquote> <p>From Robert Colvile, director of the <strong>Centre for Policy Studies</strong>, a Conservative thinktank</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>On Monday, Rachel Reeves said that she was ‘not a zealot’ on green energy, that she was ‘really committed to boosting our energy security’, that ‘investing in homegrown energy is really important’, and that she ‘would prefer us to be using oil and gas from the UK than importing in from overseas’.</p> <p>Today, Ed Miliband announced a ban on fracking - which has been at the heart of the energy revolution in the US - even as bills for customers rose yet again.</p> <p>Labour has to decide whether it is a party of ideology or a party that delivers for ordinary people.

This interview signalled a transformation in how Labour will fight Reform UK, which has a lead of about 10 points over Labour in the polls. Much of Starmer’s speech yesterday was just devoted to fleshing this argument out.

They’re frustrated about the pace of change. </p> <p>So I’m not for a moment suggesting that they are racist.

That to me would tear our country apart.</p> </blockquote> <p>In other interviews, asked if he was calling people who voted Reform UK, Starmer said “not in the slightest”.</p> <p>In his interview, <strong>Robert Peston</strong>, ITV News’ political editor, pointed out that, if Starmer does not think Reform UK supporters are racist, he is out of step with the plurality of voters who do. He referred to some <a href="https://x.com/itvpeston/status/1973037046718685658">polling by YouGov</a> for his Peston programme that illustrates this.</p>    <p>Peston asked Starmer how he could call a policy racist, but not the people supporting it. Starmer just gave a version of the answer he gave to Sky, saying:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I am not calling Reform voters racist.

They are playing out now. As you would expect, they are very repetitive – a lot of the questions and the answers are the same – but there are still plenty of new lines in them.</p> <p>One of his most audacious answers came when he was speaking to Christopher Hope, political editor of GB News, Reform UK’s favourite TV channel. Hope asked if the government would stop the small boats, and Starmer said that the returns agreement that he negotiated with France would make a difference. But then he went on to claim that they were “Farage boats, in many senses” because after Brexit the Dublin convention returns agreement that used to be in place no longer applied.</p> <p>Here is Starmer’s answer in full.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The returns agreement with France is important because we need to establish that if you come by boat, you will be returned to France.</p> <p>I accept the numbers [returned so far under the agreement] are low. We had to prove the concept and prove that it could work. We’ve now done that. But now we need to ramp that up.</p> <p>I would gently point out to Nigel Farage and others that before we left the EU, we had a returns agreement with every country in the EU. And he told the country it will make no difference if we left. Well, he was wrong about that. These are Farage boats, in many senses, that are coming across the channel.</p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer does not seem to have used this line in other interviews and it is not clear yet whether this is the start of a sustained government attempt to rebrand these as “Farage boats”, or whether Starmer was just trying to wind up Hope, who often asks questions that reflect the views of his Farage-loving viewers.</p> <p><strong>Ed Davey</strong>, the Lib Dem leader, made a similar argument <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/23/lib-dem-ed-davey-conference-donald-trump-keir-starmer-labour-reform-tory-latest-politics-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d2a4a08f086dd264c97628#block-68d2a4a08f086dd264c97628">in his party conference speech</a>. <strong>John Rentoul</strong>, the Independent commentator who is broadly sympathetic to Labour, <a href="https://x.com/JohnRentoul/status/1973277063550575101">said this morning </a>Davey and Starmer were both wrong to argue that being out of the Dublin convention made much difference to small boat arrival numbers.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Surprised by PM repeating Ed Davey’s bogus analysis: boats are nothing to do with Brexit; &amp; the Dublin convention never worked</p> </blockquote> <p>But in fact the Dublin convention probably isn’t the key issue. Peter Walsh, a senior researcher at the <strong>Migration Observatory</strong>, a migration thinktank, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/08/labour-deputy-leadership-election-contest-keir-starmer-angela-rayner-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-68bea8df8f08f8842fbb453f#block-68bea8df8f08f8842fbb453f">argued recently</a> that Brexit is making the small boat problem worse because the UK no longer has access to an EU fingerprint database, and that means asylum seekers can come to the UK knowing they won’t automatically be thrown out because they have applied in another European country. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>There’s also increasing evidence of a Brexit effect [in explaining why migrants want to leave France and come to the UK]. We speak with asylum seekers now, and often they’ve claimed asylum in the EU country, sometimes been refused, but they understand that because the UK is no longer a part of the EU, and no longer party to the EU’s fingerprint database for asylum seekers, if they can get to the UK, they have another bite of the cherry and another chance to secure asylum status and remain in Europe.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>There are plenty more lines in the Starmer interviews.
