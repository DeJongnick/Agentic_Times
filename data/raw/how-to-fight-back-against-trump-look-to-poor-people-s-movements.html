<p>For tens of millions of people, Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is a grotesque nightmare. The proposed legislative cuts, including <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/23/what-medicaid-snap-cuts-in-house-republican-bill-mean-for-benefits.html">historic attacks on Medicaid and Snap</a>, come at a time when <a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/03/bernie-sanders-paycheck-economic-statistics">60% of Americans</a> already cannot make ends meet. As justification, Maga Republicans are once again invoking the shibboleth of work requirements to demean and discredit the poor, even as they funnel billions of dollars into the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/trump-budget-proposal-defense-spending">war economy</a> and lavish the wealthy with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/24/politics/house-tax-spending-cuts-bill-explained">tax cuts</a>.</p> <p>As anti-poverty organizers, we’ve often used the slogan: “They say cut back, we say fight back.” It’s a catchy turn of phrase, but it reveals that for too long we’ve been on the back foot. In the world’s richest country, in which mass poverty exists beside unprecedented plenty, we’re tired of just fending off the worst attacks. Too much ground is lost when our biggest wins are simply not losing past gains. Amid Trump’s cruelty and avarice, it’s time to fight for a new social contract – one that lifts from the bottom of society so that everybody rises.</p> <p>There are no shortcuts to building the kind of popular power necessary for us to shift from defense to offense. The task is a generational one, requiring even greater discipline, sacrifice, perseverance and patience. But as we consider the best way forward, the past offers clues.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/18/what-the-last-trump-presidency-can-teach-us-about-fighting-back">What the last Trump presidency can teach us about fighting back | Kenneth Roth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In our new book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/you-only-get-what-you-re-organized-to-take-lessons-from-the-movement-to-end-poverty-liz-theoharis/21634785">You Only Get What You’re Organized to Take: Lessons from the Movement to End Poverty</a>, we document insights from some of this country’s most significant poor people’s movements. As nascent fascism continues to metastasize, these largely untold stories contain some of the very solutions we need to prevent democratic decline and overcome bigotry, political violence, Christian nationalism and economic immiseration. Today, the historic demands of the poor – for safety, belonging, peace, equality and justice – are rapidly becoming the demands of humanity. The hard-fought wisdom of the organized poor has much to teach all of us.</p> <p>We’re reminded of the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, especially the <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2018/06/26/forgotten-feminisms-johnnie-tillmons-battle-against-the-man/">National Welfare Rights Organization</a> (NWRO). Largely forgotten to history, NWRO was once the biggest poor people’s organization in the country. The organization, led by poor Black women, regularly staged mass marches and demonstrations and held picket lines and sit-ins at welfare offices, at a time when the poor were subject to racist, exclusionary and moralizing policies. At its height, the organization had more than 100 local chapters, a <a href="https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/organizations/national-welfare-rights-organization/">sophisticated operation </a>that offered a political and spiritual home to more than 20,000 dues-paying members.</p> <p>In 1971 in Nevada, where the governor was cutting the social safety net, the local NWRO chapter organized 1,000 women to <a href="https://www.stormingcaesarspalace.com/">storm Caesars Palace</a>, the luxury hotel and casino, and shut down the main drag in Las Vegas. The protest turned into a multiyear campaign of civil disobedience, and a federal judge eventually reinstated the benefits. These women were unapologetically militant and willing to take big risks. They were also clear that forging power required the less visible spadework of movement-building – including looking after one another through networks of solidarity and collective care.</p> <p>At the same time as the Black Panthers were feeding tens of thousands of children through the <a href="https://www.history.com/articles/free-school-breakfast-black-panther-party">free breakfast program</a> (and provocatively asking why the government couldn’t do the same, even as it spent billions of dollars slaughtering the poor of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos), NWRO created its own innovative “projects of survival”. The historian Annelise Orleck <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/04/these-black-mothers-bet-on-themselves-and-transformed-las-vegas/">writes that in Las Vegas</a>, the “welfare moms applied for and won federal grants to open and run … the first health clinic in the largely Black, and thoroughly poor Westside of Las Vegas. Then came the neighborhood’s first library, public swimming pool, senior citizen housing project, solarization program, crime prevention program, and community newspaper, all organized and staffed by poor mothers and later their young adult children.”</p> <p>As the experience in Las Vegas revealed, the women of NWRO were organizers, caretakers and strategists of the highest order. They were also anti-racists and feminists of an entirely new mold. At a time when many women were fighting for equality within the workplace, NWRO championed “welfare as a right”, challenging the notion that the value of a human is tied to their ability to work within the marketplace and raising fundamental questions about how a society cares for its people. This idea coalesced into their demand for a “guaranteed adequate income”, an early precursor to the expanded child tax credit in 2021. Before this pandemic-era program was abandoned by both reactionary Republicans and recalcitrant Democrats, it lifted 4 million children above the poverty line, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/21/23882353/child-poverty-expanded-child-tax-credit-census-welfare-inflation-economy-data">single-largest decrease in official child poverty</a> in American history.</p> <p>In a <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2021/03/25/welfare-is-a-womens-issue-ms-magazine-spring-1972/">legendary article</a> for the 1972 spring issue of Ms Magazine, Johnnie Tillmon, the first chairperson of NWRO and later its executive director, wrote: “For a lot of middle-class women in this country, Women’s Liberation is a matter of concern. For women on welfare, it’s a matter of survival … As far as I’m concerned, the ladies of NWRO are the frontline troops of women’s freedom. Both because we have so few illusions and because our issues are so important to all women – the right to a living wage for women’s work, the right to life itself.”</p> <p>Veterans of the welfare rights movement named their model of grassroots organizing after Tillmon. In “<a href="https://universityofthepoor.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HUHP-A-Brief-History-FINAL.pdf">the Johnnie Tillmon model</a>”, poor women, and poor people more broadly, are not simply an oppressed identity group but a latent social force with potentially vast power. Because they have the least invested in the status quo and the most to gain from big change, they are strategically positioned to rise up and rally not just their own communities, but the millions more who are one paycheck, healthcare crisis, job loss, debt collection or eviction away from poverty.</p> <p>In order to harness this transformational power, the Johnnie Tillmon model proposes four strategic principles, as relevant today as they were in the 1960s and 1970s:</p> <ol> <li><p>The poor must unite across their differences and assume strong leadership within grassroots movements.</p></li> <li><p>These movements must operate as a politically and financially independent force in our public life.</p></li> <li><p>The leaders of these movements must attend to the daily needs and aspirations of their communities by building visionary projects of survival.</p></li> <li><p>These projects of survival must serve as bases of operation for broader organizing, political education and leadership development.</p></li> </ol> <p>The women of NWRO believed there was unrecognized ingenuity and untapped brilliance within their communities. Even before the organization existed, the tens of thousands of women who made up its membership were already leaders in countless ways: they knew how to pool their meager resources, feed one another, navigate treacherous government bureaucracy and protect themselves from brutal state-sanctioned violence. When such survival skills were collectivized, networked and politicized, these women became a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>The same could be true today. As the Trump administration intensifies its attacks on life-saving programs like Medicaid and Snap, poor and dispossessed people will not passively swallow their suffering. Already, in states as far-flung as Vermont and Alaska, Michigan and North Carolina, we’re seeing an upsurge of resistance among Medicaid recipients. But we cannot be satisfied simply with righteous acts of protest and mass mobilization. The question is how to transform our growing indignation into lasting and visionary power. The Johnnie Tillmon model is a good place to start.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Rev Dr Liz Theoharis is the director of the Kairos Center for Religions, Rights, and Social Justice, co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign and co-founder of the Freedom Church of the Poor.
