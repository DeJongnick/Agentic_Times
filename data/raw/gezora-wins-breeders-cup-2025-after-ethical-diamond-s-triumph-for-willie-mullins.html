 <h2 class="block-title">Ethical Diamond proves Mullins the master from Aintree to Del Mar</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The 28-1 success of <strong>Ethical Diamond</strong> in the Turf for the legendary National Hunt trainer, Willie Mullins, was the highlight of a memorable and historic afternoon at Del Mar on Saturday which also saw <strong>Forever Young </strong>become the first ever Japanese-trained winner of the meeting’s showpiece event, the Breeders’ Cup Classic.</p> 
  <p>Mullins has won everything there is to win in National Hunt racing, including the British trainers’ championship and the Grand National for the past two seasons, but Ethical Diamond’s victory in the $6m Turf was a match for anything he has achieved over jumps.</p> 
  <p>Dylan Browne McMonagle was deliberately slow to stride on the five-year-old, who can race too freely if he is close to the lead, and he made steady progress down the back stretch before unleashing an irrestible run five-wide around the home turn. <strong>Ethical Diamond</strong> swept past <strong>Minnie Hauk,</strong> the Oaks winner, and <strong>Rebel’s Romance,</strong> the Turf winner in two of the last three years, to win by a comfortable length-and-a-quarter.</p> 
  <p>“My assistant, David Casey, came up with the plan,” Mullins said. “I thought, ‘why not? We’re not going to try to win it. We’ll come over here to finish fifth or sixth, hopefully’.</p>

  <p>“He can be a very difficult ride. Now that we have figured out the best tactic for him, it’s turned him inside out. The tactics are a key part to him, and Dylan being the guy he is, he’s very cool, and he executed it perfectly.</p> 
  <p>“I very rarely celebrate before the line, but I think I was celebrating, which is unlike me. But it’s pretty unlike me to have a winner in the Breeders’ Cup.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Forever Young’</strong>s win in the Classic was also a significant moment, as Yoshito Yahagi’s four-year-old turned around the 1-2-3 from last year’s race with <strong>Sierra Leone, </strong>last year’s winner, and <strong>Fierceness.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Frankie Dettori </strong>drew a blank from the final three Grade One rides of his career, finishing sixth on another Japanese-trained runner, Argine, in his last ride on the card in the Mile.</p> 
  <p>The impressive winner of that race, <strong>Notable Speech, </strong>was a 12<sup>th</sup> Breeders’ Cup winner for Charlie Appleby and a 10<sup>th</sup> for his rider, William Buick, while Gezora’s success for Francis-Henri Graffard in the concluding Filly &amp; Mare Turf was the fifth win for Europe at the meeting.</p>

  <p><strong>PREVIEW: Filly &amp; Mare Turf, 1m 3f, turf</strong></p> 
  <p>As ever, there’s a strong European hand to be played in this event, headed by <strong>Cinderella’s Dream </strong>and <strong>Diamond Rain </strong>from the Charlie Appleby stable, and <strong>Gezora </strong>for Francis-Henri Graffard. The former was third in the Group One Sun Chariot last time, while <strong>Diamond Rain, </strong>the mount of 19-year-old Billy Loughnane, was beaten a head in the Grade One E P Taylor by today’s rival <strong>She Feels Pretty </strong>back in June. <strong>Gezora </strong>was well down the field in the Arc last time but has a big chance on her second in the Prix Vermeille prior to that, while <strong>See The Fire, </strong>a wide-margin winner at York in the spring, is expected to relish the step up to a mile and three furlongs by her trainer, Andrew Balding. Aidan O’Brien’s <strong>Bedtime Story </strong>has run in nine consecutive G1 races since her last win. (in a G2), third in Vermeille not far behind Gezora but well beaten at 1m4f in F&amp;M at Ascot and yet to really confirm the form of her run into a one-length second in the Prix de Diane (French Oaks) at Chantilly in June. <strong>Stellify </strong>is another locally-trained runner to consider, she took a Grade Three at Kentucky Downs in September from the front.</p>

  <p>Definitely one of the lesser events on the Breeders’ Cup schedule, and it was diminished further this morning when the vets ruled out <strong>MystikDan</strong>, who would have set off at single-figure odds. That won’t bother Bob Baffert if <strong>Nysos </strong>takes the spoils, though, and puts him alongside Aidan O’Brien on top of the all-time list for Breeders’ Cup winners. Nysos has won his last two starts, including the Grade Three Triple Bend Stakes at Santa Anita, where he was five-and-a-half in front of Dr Venkman, third home in the Sprint earlier on the card. <strong>Full Serrano, </strong>last year’s winner and second in the Grade One Goodwood Stakes at Santa Anita in September, and another Baffert runner, <strong>Citizen Bull, </strong>the Juvenile winner here last year, are his main rivals according to the betting.</p>

  <p>And so, after one of the greatest of all riding careers, it is time for Frankie Dettori to bow out, aboard the Japanese-trained <strong>Argine </strong>in the race where it all began for him at the Breeders’ Cup, aboard Barathea in 1994.</p> 
  <p>Will he go out with a flying dismount, the acclaim of the Del Mar grandstand and another Grade One win to his name? In all honesty, probably not. But for all that <strong>Argine </strong>seems to have something to find in this company, she has at least looked very well during morning exercise. </p> 
  <p><strong>Notable Speech </strong>is top on ratings and quickened well to win the Woodbine Mile last time, having also won the 2,000 Guineas and Sussex Stakes last year.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sahlan </strong>is a fast-improving three-year-old, who won the Moulin last time out with The Lion In Winter less than a length away in third. It was a career-best run for both horses.</p> 
  <p><strong>Rhetorical, Program Trading </strong>and <strong>Jonquil </strong>were first, second and fourth in the Coolmore Turf Mile at Keeneland in October. <strong> </strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Formidable Man </strong>was a Grade One winner at Santa Anita earlier in the year and won over track and trip in a Grade Two last time. It’s also interesting that he has a perfect 5-5 record over track and trip.</p>

  <p>A fantastic result for Japanese trainer <strong>Yoshito Yahagi, </strong>and perhaps an overdue win for <strong>Forever Young, </strong>who got the worst of the interference in the home stretch in an incredibly tight finish to last year’s Kentucky Derby. </p> 
  <p><strong>Ryusei Sakai</strong> was sitting close behind the pace from the off and struck for home at the perfect time coming off the bend, carving out a lead that <strong>Sierra</strong> <strong>Leone</strong> and <strong>Fierceness</strong> could not close down. The same three horses as last year fill the frame in the Classic, but crucially for Japanese racing, in a different order. </p>

  <p>That was an astonishing race, one that will be talked about for years to come. The big three of <strong>Minnie Hauk, Goliath </strong>and <strong>Rebel’s Romance </strong>all moved into contention rounding the final turn and it promised to be a three-way go, but Dylan Browne McMonagle, who trailed the field early on <strong>Ethical Diamond, </strong>had other ideas. </p> 
  <p>He came with a sweeping, irresistible run on the Ebor winner, a 28-1 outsider, and simply flew past the previous Group One winners in the final furlong. Breathtaking, extraordinary stuff. Or, as Mullins himself put it, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. </p>

  <p><strong>PREVIEW: Classic, 1m 2f, dirt</strong></p> 
  <p>There’s no sugaring the bitter pill of <strong>Sovereignty’s </strong>withdrawal earlier in the week, as with the Kentucky Derby winner in the field, this would be the best running of the Classic for at least 20 years. But it is still a pretty deep renewal, with last year’s front three – <strong>Sierra Leone, Fierceness </strong>and <strong>Forever Young </strong>– all back for another crack, and the second and third in the Run For The Roses at Churchill Downs – <strong>Journalism </strong>and <strong>Baeza </strong>– also in the field. <strong>Journalism </strong>went on to win the second leg of the Triple Crown, the Preakness, in the absence of Sovereignty, who then returned to the track in the Belmont, where <strong>Journalism </strong>was again the runner-up. <strong>Journalism </strong>most recently finished three-and-a-quarter lengths second behind <strong>Fierceness </strong>in the Pacific Classic, his first outing in an all-aged race. <strong>Forever Young </strong>was arguably a little unlucky in last year’s Kentucky Derby and won the Saudi Cup back in February before running a two-length third in the Dubai World Cup a few weeks later. He has clearly been prepared solely with this race in mind ever since.</p>

  <p><strong>PREVIEW: Turf, 1m 4f, turf</strong></p> 
  <p>This is undoubtedly the best race on the card from a European perspective, as three outstanding Group One winners face off over a mile-and-a-half. </p> 
  <p><strong>Rebel’s Romance, </strong>a winner of this twice already, will join an elite group of three horses with three Breeders’ Cup wins if he goes in again, and looked as good as ever when he warmed up for Del Mar with a win at Aqueduct. </p> 
  <p><strong>Minnie Hauk </strong>has won three Oaks this summer – at Epsom, the Curragh and then the Yorkshire version at the Ebor meeting – and was edged out only narrowly in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe three weeks ago. </p> 
  <p><strong>Goliath, </strong>meanwhile, was an emphatic winner of the King George &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in 2024 and has looked to be working his way back to his very form in recent months. </p> 
  <p>There is little to separate them on ratings, and there are several live each-way shots in behind them too, including <strong>Wimbledon Hawkeye, </strong>with Frankie in the plate, and Ralph Beckett’s <strong>Amiloc, </strong>an impressive winner of the King Edward VII at Royal Ascot in the summer. </p> 
  <p>And as the jumps season gets into gear back in Britain and Ireland, there’s even a Willie Mullins runner to make it feel like home, as <strong>Ethical Diamond </strong>attempts to follow up his Ebor success in August. </p>

  <p><strong>PREVIEW: Distaff, 1m 1f, dirt</strong></p> 
  <p>The filly and mare version of the Classic, and a race where the “big three” of <strong>Seismic Beauty, Nitrogen </strong>and <strong>Dorth Vader </strong>take out a big chunk of the betting market. They are tightly grouped in terms of their <em>Timeform </em>ratings too, with only a couple of pound between the three of them. </p> 
  <p><strong>Seismic Beauty,</strong> though, is a solid favourite, and arrives off the back of a Grade One success in the Clement L Hirsch at this track in August. </p> 
  <p><strong>Dorth Vader </strong>is making her first trip to the west coast and does not arrive with winning form last time out, but she could not have been much closer to the now-retired Thorpedo Anna, last year’s Distaff champion, in the <strong>Personal Ensign</strong> at Saratoga, where she was gaining all the way to the line and went down by a nose. </p> 
  <p><strong>Nitrogen </strong>too was a close second last time, she was held off by the re-opposing <strong>Gin Gin</strong> in the Spinster Stakes, where it looked – to me at least – as though she was a little reluctant to pass the winner. <strong>Scylla, </strong>another runner worth running a rule over, was third in that race.</p>

  <p><strong>PREVIEW: Sprint, 6f, dirt</strong></p> 
  <p>One of the most significant pieces of form ahead of the Sprint is often the form from last year’s running of the race and it could be the same again this time around as <strong>Straight No Chaser </strong>and <strong>Bentornato, </strong>the 1-2 12 months ago, are both back for another crack. <strong>Straight No Chaser </strong>has been busier than Bentornato since, and last year’s runner-up did not see a track again until returning from a 10-month layoff with a win at Churchill Downs. Others to consider include <strong>Imagination, </strong>bidding to give Bob Baffert a quick double after his win in the opener, and <strong>Kopion, </strong>whose 59-year-old rider, “Big Money” Mike Smith, will be the oldest winning jockey in Breeders’ Cup history if he gets home in front.</p>

  <p><strong>PREVIEW: Turf Sprint, 5f, turf</strong></p> 
  <p>One of the big European hopes for this race, <strong>Arizona Blaze, </strong>was among the veterinary scratches yesterday but there are still a few visitors with a chance and all – well, most – eyes will be on <strong>Khaadem </strong>and Frankie Dettori as they attempt to follow up a Grade One win in the <strong>Woodford Stakes</strong> at Keeneland in October. </p> 
  <p>Adrian Murray, Arizona Blaze’s trainer, still has a runner in <strong>Bucanero Fuerte, </strong>who will now be ridden by <strong>Amo Racing’s</strong> retained rider, David Egan, while <strong>She’s Quality, </strong>another Irish-trained runner, has decent prospects too having finished third in the <strong>Prix de l’Abbaye</strong> at Longchamp last time and has been aimed at this race all year. </p> 
  <p>A fair squad of US-trained turf sprinting rivals includes <strong>Motorious, Ag Bullet </strong>and <strong>Reef Runner, </strong>and all three have form in the book this year that puts them in with a live chance. They also, obviously, have experience of racing at high speed around a tight turn and that is not to be underestimated. <strong>Ag Bullet </strong>in particular has Grade One winning form in the Jaipur at Saratoga in June and could be the one to beat the visitors and register a fourth US win in this race in the last five runnings. </p>

  <p><strong>PREVIEW: Filly &amp; Mare Sprint, 7f, dirt</strong></p> 
  <p>This was shaping up to be one of the better runnings of this somewhat quirky event for female horses over seven furlongs, which does not count as a sprint trip in Europe but apparently does on this side of the pond. </p> 
  <p>The vets, however, decided to scratch nearly a third of the field this morning, including two of the big-name runners, <strong>Sweet Azteca </strong>and <strong>Tamara </strong>– the veteran rider <strong>Mike Smith’s</strong> best chance to become the oldest winning jockey in Breeders’ Cup history. </p> 
  <p>It has been left looking decidedly thin as a result, though Bob Baffert has been handed a huge chance to notch a 20<sup>th</sup> Breeders’ Cup win, which would put him alongside the late D Wayne Lukas and just one behind Aidan O’Brien in the all-time list. Baffert fields <strong>Richi</strong>, the runner-up in the Zenyatta Stakes last time, and <strong>Splendora, </strong>a winner over a mile at Del Mar in September, while <strong>Hope Road, </strong>the Grade One Ballerina Stakes winner at <strong>Saratoga </strong>looks likely to be the main threat to the Baffert duo. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Preamble</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hello from Del Mar racetrack near San Diego, where it is day two of the 2025 Breeders’ Cup and it is also, in case you’ve just returned from Mars, <strong>Frankie Dettori’s</strong> final day as a top-level jockey. His mutterings about taking a few rides in South America before finally calling it a day spoil the sense of finality just a little, but there is no doubt that <strong>Khaadem, </strong>in the Turf Sprint (19.41 GMT), <strong>Wimbledon Hawkeye </strong>in the Turf (21.41 GMT) and <strong>Argine, </strong>in the Mile (23.05 GMT), will be the last Grade One rides of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/31/true-legend-what-now-for-frankie-dettori-horse-racing-biggest-name-leaves-stage">remarkable 40-year career</a>.</p> 
  <p>All three fall into the category of live each-way chances, and all three were winners at a high level last time out. Even so, Dettori will need to conjure up a career-best performance from somewhere among them if he is to bow out with one last flying dismount.</p> 
  <p>Dettori is far from being the only legend on the card, however. <strong>Rebel’s Romance, </strong>one of the best and most consistent Group One performers in the game, will join Beholder and Goldikova as a three-times Breeders’ Cup winner if he can get another victory in the Turf on the board. Charlie Appleby’s gelding is up against <strong>Minnie Hauk, </strong>the Arc runner-up, and last year’s King George winner, <strong>Goliath, </strong>in one of the best renewals of one of the seven original Breeders’ Cup races.</p> 
  <p><strong>Goliath </strong>is joined by two stable companions at the Francis-Henri Graffard yard, <strong>Sahlan </strong>in the <strong>Mile</strong> and <strong>Gezora, </strong>in the concluding <strong>Filly &amp; Mare Turf</strong>, as France’s new champion trainer bids to end a cold streak for French-trained horses at the meeting that dates back to 2017. And in addition to the European interest in the four contests on turf, the action on the dirt includes a renewal of the <strong>Classic</strong> that pits the first three home in last year’s race against two of the first three home in the <strong>Kentucky</strong> <strong>Derby</strong>.</p> 
  <p>There has been some drama here already this morning, as <strong>Tamara </strong>and <strong>Sweet Azteca, </strong>two of the top three in the betting for the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint, were among the “veterinary scratches” announced earlier this morning, along with another runner in the same race, <strong>Fee Blanche, </strong>and Donnacha O’Brien’s <strong>Atsila, </strong>in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf. With the much fancied <strong>Arizona Blaze </strong>having been ruled out of the Turf Sprint yesterday, that takes the total of veterinary scratches on today’s card to six. </p> 
  <p>The main card at the Breeders’ Cup is always a giddy ride which throws up commanding performances, compelling finishes and, as a rule, a big upset or two along the way. Picks for the nine races are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/31/true-legend-what-now-for-frankie-dettori-horse-racing-biggest-name-leaves-stage">here</a> (if you scroll to the end), the action is underway with the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint on the dirt at 19.00 GMT, and I’ll be tapping away trackside to keep you up to date with all the news and results until the final horse home in the <strong>Filly &amp; Mare Turf</strong> is across the line.</p>
