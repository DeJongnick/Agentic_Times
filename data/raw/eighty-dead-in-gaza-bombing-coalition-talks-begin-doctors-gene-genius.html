<p>Morning everyone. Israeli bombing of targets in Gaza have left 80 people dead overnight while talks on a possible ceasefire faltered during Donald Trump’s Middle East tour. The first talks between the new Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, and the Nationals have begun with sticking points including the rural party’s opposition to net zero and demand for more representation in the shadow ministry. We assess the task ahead of another new leader, Larissa Waters for the Greens, and examine what the new brooms might mean for Australian politics. In more cheerful news, doctors have edited the genes of a baby born with a severe genetic disorder.</p>

<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>It’s said that Larissa Waters was reluctant to become leader of the Greens ahead of some more high-profile names. But she is regarded by colleagues as smart, warm and friendly, and – perhaps crucially – is seen as pragmatic by Labor counterparts with whom she will have to deal if she wants to help the government be bolder. Our chief political correspondent, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/16/larissa-waters-vows-politics-with-heart-but-dont-expect-compromise-on-core-greens-principles">Tom McIlroy, assesses where she might take the party</a>.</p>
