<p>Chris Wilder is poised to make a surprise return at Sheffield United and manage his boyhood club for a third time after the Blades sacked Rubén Sellés following six defeats from six games. United acted after Sellés’s side <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/12/ipswich-sheffield-united-championship-match-report">were dismantled 5-0 at Ipswich</a> on Friday.</p> <p>Wilder was dismissed after losing the Championship playoff final at Wembley and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/18/ruben-selles-sheffield-united-new-manager-chris-wilder-exit">the Blades turned to Sellés</a>, who narrowly avoided relegation with Hull City last season.</p> <p>Sellés attended United’s playoff semi-final first-leg win at Bristol City and was hastily appointed after talks with their US owner, the COH sports group consortium.</p> <p>It is thought Wilder will return to Bramall Lane empowered, given the manager previously clashed with the ownership around its shift in transfer strategy. United’s owner’s attempts to implement artificial intelligence-led recruitment have so far backfired.</p> <p>The Spaniard Sellés, who also coached at Southampton and Reading, was an unpopular appointment and endured a disastrous spell in Sheffield. He lost all six matches in charge, five in the league, and his side had not scored a goal in their past four fixtures.</p> <p>“Sheffield United’s board of directors have opted to make a change at managerial level,” confirmed the club on Sunday afternoon. “After a disappointing start to the Championship campaign, Rubén Sellés has been relieved of his duties as manager.</p> <p>“Following a review of recent performances, and taking into account the feelings of supporters, the timing of the change has been made to give the club the best possible opportunity to improve the current league position. The board of directors wish to thank Mr Sellés for his hard work. A new manager will be named in due course.”</p> <p>The Blades recognised the need to sack Sellés after Friday’s humiliation at Portman Road. United’s co-chair Steven Rosen is understood to have been in attendance for that capitulation at Ipswich.</p>
