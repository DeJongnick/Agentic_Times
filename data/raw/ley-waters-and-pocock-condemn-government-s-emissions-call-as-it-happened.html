  <p><strong>Manhunt ends with capture of allegedly dangerous Queensland fugitive</strong></p> 
  <p>An allegedly “dangerous” fugitive accused of shooting a man and evading police at the scene of a car crash is in custody following a manhunt, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p><strong>John Durham Willey</strong>, 42, was found in bushland a day after his dramatic alleged escape following the two-vehicle crash in central Queensland.</p> 
  <p>He was charged with a string of offences after he was located following a public appeal for assistance, ending a manhunt spanning more than 1,000km.</p> 
  <p>Willey had been on the run since he and a 47-year-old woman allegedly shot a 45-year-old man in the leg in a Cairns hotel in the state’s far north on September 9, police said.</p> 
  <p>A week later, police were called about midday on Tuesday to the two-vehicle crash involving a Holden ute and a caravan on the Bruce Highway near Rockhampton.</p> 
  <p>Willey and the woman allegedly fled the Holden on foot, sparking an emergency exclusion zone by police.</p> 
  <p>The woman was arrested in nearby bushland, with footage released by police showing the dramatic scene.</p> 
  <p>“Show me your hands. Get on the ground. Hands behind your back,” a police officer can be heard yelling before placing handcuffs on the woman.</p> 
  <p>Willey evaded police, with officers later finding two firearms and ammunition in the ute. Other firearms were found in a golf bag nearby, police said.</p> 
  <p>Police issued a public plea for information on Wednesday, warning Willey was armed and should not be approached.</p>

  <p><strong>Self-driving car forecasts speed up after Tesla launch</strong></p> 
  <p>Autonomous cars with no human behind the wheel could be roaming Australian roads in time for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games, a transport summit has been told, although questions remain about their safety and cost, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Strict regulations will also need to be in place to govern their use around the event, according to speakers at the National Future Transport Summit in Brisbane, although Australia was “on track” to deliver them.</p> 
  <p>The predictions came as US carmaker Tesla announced the launch of its self-driving software in Australia following weeks of testing and widespread speculation.</p> 
  <p>The two-day transport summit heard Uber considered Australia to be a prime location for self-driving vehicles as it had embraced ride-share options and regulators were taking steps to create national laws.</p> 
  <p>Other countries that raced to adopt self-driving cars have had to change regulations on the fly, Uber autonomous policy global head <strong>Richard Willder</strong> told the audience.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We certainly feel that Australia’s regulatory approach and the way that it’s going about it in such a thoughtful, holistic and really nuanced way is a very strong way to develop a regulatory framework.</p>

  <p>Nine of 11 local sectors closed in the red, as energy stocks tumbled more than five per cent after Abu Dhabi National Oil Company bailed out on its $28bn takeover offer for Santos.</p>

  <p>The Australian dollar is fetching 66.24 US cents, down from 66.74 US cents on Wednesday at 5pm, after weaker-than-expected August jobs growth narrowed bets for further interest rate relief ahead.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW government says it has toughest working with children checks in Australia</strong></p> 
  <p>The NSW government has passed laws it says will strengthen working with children checks (WWCC) to better protect kids from harm.</p> 
  <p>The government said in a statement that the legislation ensures only the Office of the Children’s Guardian – the state’s independent child safety regulator – will be responsible for reviewing WWCC decisions, removing external appeal pathways through the NSW civil and administrative tribunal (NCAT).</p> 
  <p>Minister for families and communities <strong>Kate Washington</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>NSW already has the strongest Working with Children Check system in the country and this week we’ve made it stronger.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The new laws come a week after <strong>Steve Kinmond</strong>, the New South Wales children’s guardian, was dismissed from his job after a scathing inquiry found he oversaw an “inept” complaints process and did not declare potential conflicts of interest.</p> 
  <p>Kinmond told Guardian Australia at the time that he rejected that he had a conflict of interest and characterised the relationship and communication as “purely professional” in nature.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The South Australian government’s two most senior ministers have quit, forcing a reshuffle just six months out from the state election, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Premier <strong>Peter Malinauskas</strong> on Thursday announced that deputy premier <strong>Susan Close</strong> and treasurer <strong>Stephen Mullighan</strong> had stood aside from cabinet and will retire from parliament at the March election.</p> 
  <p>He said he was “taken aback”, “somewhat disappointed” and “really saddened” when he was approached separately by the ministers several weeks ago, and he had tried to talk them into staying.</p> 
  <p>“I’m here today to make it very clear that my persuasive powers failed, and they have both announced their resignation to our cabinet earlier today from cabinet and their intention to not contest the next state election,” he said.</p> 
  <p>“I’ve known Susan and Stephen for a long time and they’re good friends of mine and they’ve been incredible support to me in different ways over the last few years and I’m really sad to see them go,” Malinauskas said.</p>

  <p><strong>‘Protective’ factors to prevent male violence should be encouraged, report says</strong></p> 
  <p>Services must engage with men and boys to change the conditions that enable DFSV (domestic, family and sexual violence), a government report published today says.</p> 
  <p>The Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commission has put together<a href="https://www.dfsvc.gov.au/men-and-boys-snapshot"> a snapshot of the existing knowledge base on DFSV</a> and what “protective” factors can be encouraged to prevent men becoming violent.</p> 
  <p>Commissioner <strong>Micaela Cronin</strong> wrote in the snapshot that calls to work with men and boys “acknowledge that there must be accountability for men who use violence, but that these men also need support from those around them, including friends, families and support services, to stop their violence”. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is a challenging and confronting topic to consider, particularly at a time when rates of homicide and sexual violence against women and children are so high.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The snapshot says extremism and men’s violence can be viewed within a national security lens, to help tackle rising misogynistic views in young men and boys, some of whom are being radicalised online.</p> 
  <p>It says men and boys must be “meaningfully” engaged, warns that terms such as “toxic masculinity” can be alienating, and argues for better integration of men’s behaviour change programs within the justice, social services, health and child protection sectors.</p> 
  <p>Assistant minister for social services and the prevention of family violence, <strong>Ged Kearney</strong>, said the government had invested $4bn towards preventing violence but that there was much more to do. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We know that when boys grow up with love and affection from their fathers, they are far less likely to use violence. That tells us something powerful – the answers don’t just lie in stopping harm, but in building a culture where care, respect and equality are the foundations of what it means to be a man.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW opposition ‘inclined to support’ changes to planning laws</strong></p> 
  <p>A day after the NSW premier, <strong>Chris Minns,</strong> announced significant changes to planning laws to speed the delivery of new housing, the overall response has been supportive, if cautious.</p> 
  <p>“Well, we’ll have to look at the detail. But as I said, our default position is to say why not rather than why. And unless there is something stuck in it, then we’re inclined to support the legislation,” opposition leader <strong>Mark Speakman</strong> said.</p> 
  <p>He’s also backing the decision to develop the half-built Woollahra station in the blue-ribbon seat of Woollahra, though he cast doubt on whether the already builtup area would support 10,000 homes.</p> 
  <p>The peak body for local government in NSW has broadly welcomed the changes too, despite the fact that the bill contains provisions that require them to deal with complying developments that have minor deviations within 10 days or see it automatically approved. Local Government Association president, mayor <strong>Phylis Miller,</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>LGNSW supports genuine and sensible efforts to streamline planning regulation and contribute to increasing housing supply and diversity. We want to work with the government to ensure councils are supported to fulfil their assessment and broader planning responsibilities.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She particularly welcomed the proposed one-stop shop for state approvals.</p> 
  <p>On a less welcome note, she said councils were unhappy with plans to enshrine the Housing Delivery Authority (the HDA) as a permanent fixture.</p> 
  <p>She said state and federal government funding and delivery of key infrastructure should remain the priority.</p> 
  <p>But not everyone is enamoured with a one-stop shop for state agencies.</p> 
  <p>The independent member for Wakehurst, <strong>Michael Regan</strong>, whose electorate on the Northern Beaches is particularly bushfire prone, expressed “serious concern that the government’s bill risks diluting the Rural Fire Service’s role”.</p>

  <p><strong>More on the developing Townsville mayor story</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Townsville mayor Troy Thompson</strong> has responded to the announcement that he faces sacking from the council in parliament this morning.</p> 
  <p>Thompson was elected mayor last year, but was suspended over allegations he’d misled the electorate about his military history. Local government minister <strong>Ann Leahy</strong> told parliament she had issued him with a 14-day show cause notice to explain why he shouldn’t be dismissed from the council. Thompson said on Facebook:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>These are allegations – not findings. And they have been brought forward by a minister who, in my view, is politically conflicted in this matter. Her recent comments suggest more about point-scoring and political distraction than genuine concern for due process or the Townsville community.</p> 
   <p>My legal team is prepared to respond in full once the allegations have been formally provided. Until now I have not been afforded natural justice by either the state or local government. That is unacceptable in a democratic system that claims to value fairness and integrity.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Thompson was referred to the state’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/28/townsville-mayor-troy-thompson-military-service-claims-watchdog-crime-and-corruption-commission-ntwnfb">Crime and Corruption Commission</a> last year after allegations he embellished his military record by stating he spent five years in the army, including time with “SAS Swanbourne”.</p>

  <p><strong>Townsville mayor asked to ‘show cause’ to save job</strong></p> 
  <p>Controversial Townsville mayor <strong>Troy Thompson</strong> will be issued with a show cause notice today to explain why he shouldn’t be sacked by the state government.</p> 
  <p>Local government minister <strong>Anne Leahy</strong> told parliament on Thursday that she had made the decision after a briefing by the Crime and Corruption Commission last month which “set out serious allegations”. Leahy said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I will today issue councillor Thomson with a formal show cause notice. This will provide him with 14 days to respond and sets out in detail the basis of my concerns, as required under Section 120 of the Local Government Act 2009. The notice includes a detailed explanation of the factual basis for forming my reasonable belief that dismissal may be appropriate.</p> 
   <p>Following the 14-day period and upon receipt of councillor Thomson’s response, I will carefully consider the matters raised before making a final decision.</p> 
   <p>Mr Speaker, these are serious matters, and the actions I have taken reflect this government’s firm commitment to transparency, natural justice and the highest standards of integrity in local government. At every step, my focus has been on the people of Townsville, they deserve a council that is stable, accountable and able to deliver for its community.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Thompson was elected as Townsville mayor last year. He was suspended by Leahy on full pay after allegations he misled the electorate about his military history.</p>

They can’t do it and they can’t explain how they’re going to do it. And the detail around the cost. Australians need to know that they’re going to foot the bill for this. They’re going to foot a very expensive bill, either through their energy bills but also through their grocery bills and everything else they buy.

  <p><strong>‘Worst is over’ when it comes to cocoa prices but retail chocolate prices to remain high for longer</strong></p> 
  <p>The cost of cocoa is forecast to reduce significantly by mid-2027, but retail chocolate prices will take longer to fall and are still expected to remain higher than they were four years ago.</p> 
  <p>Researchers at the agribusiness bank have published a new report that found consumers can expect some relief from rising chocolate prices, which are today more than 50% higher than they were in 2021.</p> 
  <p>The price has jumped markedly in the last year alone. In September last year, a premium-branded 100g chocolate tablet retailed at EUR 2.93 at the time at a Dutch supermarket, the report said.</p> 
  <p>The same product is now retailing at EUR 3.95, an increase of nearly 35% in just 12 months.</p> 
  <p><strong>Paul Joules</strong>, an agriculture analysist at RaboResearch, says the surge in retail chocolate prices was caused by a “cocoa shock” or crisis in the industry caused by poor harvests, crop disease and “structural supply issues”.</p> 
  <p>Joules says while the worst is over, global cocoa prices will remain above “pre-crisis” levels due to ongoing issues including aging trees, crop disease, and climate volatility, which means retail prices could take longer to fall. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The chocolate market is entering a new era of higher costs and persistent volatility, requiring agility and continuous adaptation from industry players.</p> 
   <p>While the peak of chocolate retail price inflation may be behind us, the pressure remains, and the industry is hedging its bets for a resilient future.</p>

  <p><strong>Brittany Higgins to appeal damages after defamation ruling</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Brittany Higgins</strong> will appeal a $341k payout and 80% of legal costs to her former boss, ex-Liberal senator <strong>Linda Reynolds</strong>, after a Western Australian supreme court ruled last month she defamed the once-Liberal frontbencher in two social media posts.</p> 
  <p>Two appeal notices, submitted to the court on Wednesday, show Higgins’ defence team will fight the orders <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/aug/27/brittany-higgins-defamation-trial-verdict-linda-reynolds-victory-ntwnfb">delivered by </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/aug/27/brittany-higgins-defamation-trial-verdict-linda-reynolds-victory-ntwnfb">Justice Paul Tottle</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/aug/27/brittany-higgins-defamation-trial-verdict-linda-reynolds-victory-ntwnfb"> on 27 August</a>.</p> 
  <p>Tottle ruled Reynolds’ reputation was damaged by a 2022 social media post from Higgins’ partner <strong>David Sharaz</strong>, which Higgins responded to, as well as an Instagram story published by Higgins in July 2023. </p> 
  <p>Higgins’ legal team, however, successfully defended a third social media post – also found to be defamatory – as honest opinion, fair comment and qualified privilege. Reynolds was unable to prove Higgins and Sharaz had concocted a conspiracy to publicly release the details of Higgins’s alleged rape with the “sole or predominant purpose” of destroying the former senator’s reputation, Tottle’s judgment said.</p> 
  <p>The court ruled that Higgins pay $315,000 in damages with an additional $26,109.25 in interest. Earlier this month, the court made a separate ruling on additional costs, ordering Higgins to pay 80% of Reynolds’ legal costs for the five-week defamation trial. It’s expected the total bill will easily surpass million-dollar territory.</p> 
  <p>The appeal notices show Higgins’ legal team is not appealing the judgment but focusing on the damages payout and the direction to pay 80% of Reynolds’ legal bills.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Analysis: Labor's climate targets promise everyone a prize</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Albanese</strong> government has announced an <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong>-style emissions target for 2035 - tried to promise (nearly) everyone a prize.</p> 
  <p>We haven’t had time to absorb the advice that underpins it, but the range of 62% to 70% is clearly at least partly a political solution. It is extraordinarily wide.</p> 
  <p>At the bottom end, the goal is clearly designed to dampen criticism from business organisations arguing for less action. At the top end it meets a demand from some scientists and climate campaigners that it must include a number with a “7” in front of it - that is, that it reaches into the 70s.</p> 
  <p>This won’t be enough to nullify criticism: it is already pouring into my inbox from climate-focused organisations and scientists. The reality is the target sets a minimum goal of 62% but scientists say the country’s part in meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement would be more than 75% - possibly significantly more.</p> 
  <p>The range is well below what the <strong>Climate Change Authority</strong> thought was “ambitious, but achievable” early last year when it nominated 65% to 75%. Why the change? We need more detailed answers on that than we got at the press conference.</p> 
  <p>Will this goal help Australia take a leading role in avoiding the worst projections set out in the national risk assessment released on Monday? Certainly not if we end up at 62%.</p> 
  <p>But what matters now is the policies. And we will need a lot more - a lot more - to get where we need to be.</p>

  <p><strong>Fortescue head says Labor has shown ‘courage of leadership’ but calls for even higher emissions cuts</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Andrew Forrest</strong>, chairman of mining giant Fortescue, has also called on the government to be more ambition, arguing the upper range of 70% should be a “floor” not a ceiling.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It [the government] has shown the courage of leadership. Yet let me be clear: the upper range of its target – 70% – must be a floor, not a ceiling.</p> 
   <p><strong>A cut of at least 75% is what is needed for Australia to pursue emissions reductions in line with the science.</strong> This remains the only course that can avert the accelerating impacts of a world warmed beyond 1.5°C.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Fortescue was one of more than 500 businesses including Atlassian, Canva, and Unilever calling for a 75% target in the lead up to the announcement.</p> 
  <p>Former emergency leaders are also warning the target will leave emergency responders in a critical situation. The <strong>Emergency Leaders for Climate Action </strong>group warns the bottom end of the target will fall “dangerously short of what’s needed to protect both communities and emergency responders.” The former commissioner of Fire &amp; Rescue NSW, <strong>Greg Mullins</strong>, says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>If that’s the level of risk we’re accepting, then what’s the plan for dealing with it?</strong> Emergency leaders want to see a concrete, well-funded plan for how the Albanese government is going to support communities and first responders to adapt to the compounding, cascading and concurrent disasters its own risk assessment outlines if we’re choosing not to cut climate pollution any further or faster.</p>

  <p><strong>Environmental groups’ verdict on Labor emissions targets: ‘weak’</strong></p> 
  <p>We’re getting plenty of reaction to the 2035 target, and environment groups are pushing for far more ambitious action.</p> 
  <p><strong>Greenpeace</strong> has called the target “weak” while the <strong>Australian Conservation Foundation</strong> has labelled it “timid”.</p> 
  <p>Both groups accuse the government of prioritising the fossil fuel industry over community safety.</p> 
  <p><strong>Greenpeace Australia Pacific</strong> says the target is “not science-aligned, and undermines global action under the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5C”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It prioritises fossil fuel profits and business interests over people, and effectively abandons our commitment under the Paris Agreement… a temperature goal that is non-negotiable for Pacific nations staring down the barrel of climate catastrophe.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The ACF’s climate and energy program manager, <strong>Gavan McFadzean,</strong> says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A target range of 62% to 70%<em> </em>falls significantly short on all measures of what’s needed, with the government’s plans preparing Australia only to meet the bottom end of the range.</p>

  <p><strong>PM won’t say how much power bills will drop under 2035 plan</strong></p> 
  <p>The prime minister says there needs to be “lean in” from all levels of government and business to get to the target.</p> 
  <p>He also adds that the amount of wind and solar power in China is now “nearly twice as much as the rest of the world combined. Just a fun fact”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have a target range, it depends upon as we have outlined, whether there is a lean in and by other levels of government, by the private sector as well, industry … we know that the federal government can only do so much.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Finally, Albanese is asked exactly how much power bills will come down (which makes all the journalists in the room laugh).</p> 
  <p>Albanese won’t give a figure – you might remember how much the opposition likes to bring up Labor’s pre-2022 election promise of a reduction in energy bills by $275, which they had to abandon. The PM says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>You yourself laughed when he asked that question so, it should be treated in the spirit which you’ve done.</strong> What we know is if we do not act, they will be a cost [to] the economy as [the] treasurer has outlined. They will be: lower wages, lower growth, less jobs.</p>

  <p>Albanese is asked whether the range means the government’s target is actually 62%.</p> 
  <p>He says the target is consistent with those of other nations who also have a target range, and says it’s consistent with technological development that will help Australia achieve that target range.</p> 
  <p>The government is also asked whether the range means the government isn’t aligned with the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.</p> 
  <p>But Bowen says the target still has that objective.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is very clear that we have set a target based on science and the objective of 1.5 degrees. That is what we are required to do under law.</p> 
   <p>They [the Climate Council Authority] said we should go for maximum ambition. They then looked at what is achievable in the Australian context and that is exactly 62% to 70%. </p> 
   <p>This range reflects two things, it reflects that technology changes over a decade in ways that not everyone can easily predict 10 years out and we recognise that.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Human Rights Law Centre</strong> has sent a formal complaint to the UN over the “violent arrest” of <strong>Hannah Thomas</strong> and the “wider erosion” of protest rights in New South Wales.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, the centre said the complaint warned:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The NSW “protest permit” Form 1 system is being increasingly misused as a protest authorisation system, forcing protest organisers to seek police approval or face significant financial penalties and/or imprisonment.</p> 
   <p>NSW Police have unchecked discretion to determine which protests receive legal protection and which do not.</p> 
   <p>The dangerous consequences of these powers [were] seen most starkly in Ms Thomas’ violent arrest, where the absence of a Form 1 was used as the basis for dispersal and arrest, with serious consequences for her safety.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The complaint called on the <strong>United Nations Special Rapporteur</strong> that focuses on rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association to request the Australian government to explain how the form 1 system and NSW anti-protest laws are compatible with the nation’s human rights obligation.</p> 
  <p>Earlier this month, the office of the director of public prosecution <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/09/hannah-thomas-former-greens-nsw-police-drop-all-charges">dropped charges </a>against Thomas, a former Greens candidate who was arrested at a Sydney protest in June.</p>

   <p>We are going to be having a different type of communication. That is really significant. I’d say also that what we can do is be better going forward, act differently going forward. So what I can say is that at least under my interim leadership, we will do better. I’ll expect better.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Brown also said ANU would also do a stocktake of its finances and “be transparent” with its community. She said the university’s model going forward would be to rely on its own people before employing the use of consultants.</p>

  <p><strong>No further job cuts at ANU sends ‘powerful message’ to Australia’s universities, union says</strong></p> 
  <p>The <strong>National Tertiary Education Union</strong> (NTEU) says “every university staff member” facing job cuts around the nation can “take heart” from the <strong>Australian National University</strong>’<strong>s</strong> announcement that there will be no forced redundancies.</p> 
  <p>Its ACT division secretary, <strong>Dr Lachlan Clohesy</strong>, said the interim vice-chancellor, <strong>Prof Rebekah Brown</strong>, deserved credit for “reading the room accurately” on the issue. The announcement at a town hall this morning came just a week after the exit of former vice-chancellor,<strong> Prof Genevieve Bell</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Clohesy said the university’s restructure process, Renew ANU, had “damaged the university and its people”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It has broken the University. While there is work to do, we can now start to pick up the pieces. Today demonstrates that much of the pain and psychological damage of recent times was not necessary. I hope that leadership at UTS is taking note of what has happened at the ANU.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>NTEU national president,<strong> Dr Alison Barnes</strong>, said the announcement sent a “powerful message” to “all vice-chancellors pursuing reckless and unjustified cuts” and pointed to the need for major governance reform.</p> 
  <p>The town hall is continuing, with staff waiting to ask questions of Brown.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>There will be no more involuntary redundancies at the <strong>Australian National University</strong>, the interim vice-chancellor<strong>, Prof Rebekah Brown,</strong> has confirmed.</p> 
  <p>Briefing staff at a town hall meeting on Thursday morning, Brown<strong> </strong>became emotional before confirming she and the chancellor had supported no more involuntary redundancies at the institution.</p> 
  <p>She said the university would still need to do realignments and consolidate its professional services in colleges flagged for restructures, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We still need to be really mindful of our expenditure. It’s critical. What I would like to say also is that the other four colleges that are not listed here in these change proposals, they’ve been able to meet their 2025 budgetary targets, which were all contractions as well through vacancy management retirements [and] attritions.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Brown said an “anonymous donor” had also offered a generous philanthropic gift in order to continue the Australian National Dictionary Centre for the next two years. The School of Music will also be saved, Brown confirmed.</p>

  <p><strong>Migration and jobs numbers to be released today</strong></p> 
  <p>While the government’s announcement of its 2035 emissions reduction target will rightly dominate our collective attention, today we also get new figures on another increasingly hot button issue: migration.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>ABS at 11.30am</strong> will release estimated population stats for the March quarter.</p> 
  <p>Net overseas migration (or Nom) was 340,750 in the year to December, and it reached a remarkable peak of nearly 556,000 in the year to September 2023 – a rebound from the Covid-era lockdowns and closed borders.</p> 
  <p>In the few years leading up to the pandemic net overseas migration averaged about 240,000 people a year.</p> 
  <p>Today’s data should show Nom slowing again, but perhaps not as quickly as Treasury officials have forecast in the budget.</p> 
  <p>And if that wasn’t enough, the ABS will also publish labour force figures for July.</p> 
  <p>Unemployment has been in the low 4s for more than a year now, and the consensus forecast among economists is for the jobless rate to stay at 4.2% – good news that will probably keep it out of the headlines.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Retail giant <strong>Kmart</strong> breached Australians’ privacy through the use of facial recognition technology in 28 of its stores, which the company said was aimed at addressing refund fraud.</p> 
  <p>Between June 2020 and July 2022, Kmart used facial recognition tech to capture the faces of every person entering 28 of its stores, and all people who went to a refund counter, in an attempt to identify people committing refund fraud.</p> 
  <p>The privacy commissioner, <strong>Carly Kind</strong>, found Kmart did not notify shoppers or seek their consent to use the technology to collect their biometric information.</p> 
  <p>Kmart argued it was not required to obtain consent because of an exemption allowing organisations to collect the information to tackle unlawful activity or serious misconduct.</p> 
  <p>The commissioner said there were other less intrusive methods available to Kmart to address refund fraud, and the system was of “limited utility”.</p>

  <p><strong>Ziggy Tow</strong> and his housemates thought they had had enough trouble after their property manager evicted them without grounds and listed their inner-Sydney home for an extra $300 a week.</p> 
  <p>Then the property manager claimed back all of the $3,400 they paid in bond to cover cleaning and repair fees.</p> 
  <p>It took three months of disputes before New South Wales’ rent tribunal ruled the claim was nearly triple a justified amount, awarding $2,100 to the housemates, who Tow said live “paycheck to paycheck”.</p> 
  <p>“I spoke to a lot of people who [said] ‘I would have just left it’,” Tow said.</p>

It’s expected that more than 200 roles will be made redundant, many of them in Brisbane.</p> 
  <p>The BHP-Mitsubishi Alliance yesterday blamed the state’s royalties scheme for plans to mothball its Saraji South coalmine. Anglo American did not cite royalties in its Thursday announcement.</p> 
  <p>Anglo American is the country’s second largest steelmaker, operating five mines in central Queensland, including the region’s largest, the Grosvenor underground mine. Grosvenor closed as a result of an explosion last year and staff started the process of reopening in June.<br><br>Mansour said the company had undertaken a comprehensive review of its organisational structure to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>As part of this review, a small number of staff roles across our Brisbane office and operational sites have been impacted. A substantial proportion of reductions have been achieved through voluntary redundancy, and we are committed to supporting our people through this transition with access to outplacement services and wellbeing support.<br><br>For more than a year, we’ve worked to protect the jobs of our Grosvenor workforce – including redeploying roles to our other underground operations. The phased nature of the re-entry work, carried out in close coordination with regulators, means we are now in a position to engage unions and our Grosvenor EA (enterprise agreement) workforce in a voluntary redundancy expression of interest process, which is in its very early stages.</p>

  <p><strong>Queensland limits use of ‘good character’ evidence for convicted sex offenders</strong></p> 
  <p>Queensland parliament has limited convicted sex offenders from using “good character” evidence to reduce their jail term.</p> 
  <p>The laws are based on recommendations from Queensland’s sentencing advisory council and make a number of changes to the sentencing process. It also creates a new aggravating factor requiring the court to treat offences against people aged 16 or 17 as more serious, among other reforms.</p> 
  <p>Historically, rapists, like other convicted criminals, were able to introduce evidence from employers, friends and family to argue that they were otherwise of “good character”, which would be required to taken into account by the judge.</p> 
  <p>The state attorney general, <strong>Deb Frecklington</strong>, who introduced the legislation, said “no one wants to hear that a rapist is all-round great person, a trustworthy mate, or that they’re respected in the community – especially not their victim, bravely sitting in court”.</p> 
  <p>Now such evidence can only be taken into account where it is relevant to the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation or likelihood of reoffending. The legislation passed on the voices, effectively unanimously, last night.</p>

   <p>We have a tendency in New South Wales to have been tripping over our own red tape. 22 agencies having to be involved in deciding whether or not a home can be built is just too many.</p> 
   <p>And what we’re wanting to do with this reform is fundamentally modernise how we make planning decisions. But the reason why that’s important is because we do need to build more homes and we do need to build them fast than we have been in recent times. And so we do think that these reforms are a big, big step up on the existing status quo.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Unemployment expected to rise as ABS releases latest data</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Australia’s jobs market is forecast to remain in good health, despite an expected rise in the unemployment rate, <strong>Australian Associated Press</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Labour force figures to be released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics later this morning could show the jobless rate ticked up to 4.3% in August, retracing a 0.1% drop to 4.2% the month before.</p> 
  <p>That would be in line with the Reserve Bank’s forecasts for the unemployment rate, meaning it would have little impact on the central bank’s cash rate considerations, economists at JP Morgan said.</p> 
  <p>“That said, at these levels there is little scope for any further deterioration without a dovish shift in the bank’s tone/forecast,” said Ben Jarman, Tom Kennedy and Tom Ryan in a research note.</p> 
  <p>With jobs growth trending in line with overall population growth, recent data paints a picture of a labour market in balance.</p> 
  <p>“Indicators of labour demand generally have steadied over the past year or so at healthy levels,” economists at NAB said.</p> 
  <p>While strong employment growth in 2023 and 2024 was driven primarily by a rapid expansion in the health and care economy workforce, jobs growth in those sectors has flatlined since the start of 2025, they said.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>An Abu Dhabi-based consortium has withdrawn its planned $30bn takeover bid for offer for the Australian oil and gas producer Santos.</p> 
  <p>The consortium led by investment company XRG – a vehicle for the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company – blamed a “combination of factors” for its change of heart.</p> 
  <p>It said that there had been a comprehensive evaluation but it had decided not to proceed after due diligence “impacted the consortium’s assessment of its indicative offer”.</p> 
  <p>XRG said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The consortium was prepared to undertake new long-term commitments to Australian energy production that would deliver meaningful benefits to domestic gas consumers and enhance regional energy security.</p> 
   <p>As a strategic long-term investor, XRG remains dedicated to pursuing opportunities across gas &amp; LNG, chemicals, and energy solutions, and has a rich and deep pipeline of investment opportunities</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Adelaide-based Santos has operations in Australia, East Timor, Papua New Guinea and the United States, and is a major supplier of liquefied natural gas in Australia and Asia.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Murder charge over 2002 death after bones found in back yard</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Police have charged a man with murder, hours after bones were found during a search for the remains of a woman who vanished more than 20 years ago, Australian Associated Press reports.</p> 
  <p>The breakthrough in the cold case was made late on Wednesday following the discovery of suspected human remains, believed to be those of Susan Goodwin, 39, buried in the back yard of a house in Port Lincoln, South Australia.</p> 
  <p>Detectives arrested and charged a 64-year-old Port Lincoln man with the murder of Goodwin, who was reported missing in July 2002.</p> 
  <p>He will appear in Port Lincoln magistrates court today.</p> 
  <p>An anthropologist from Forensic Science SA has travelled to the town to confirm if the bones are human remains and continue excavations.</p> 
  <p>Police had been using specialised radar equipment to scan a property in Pamir Court, which adjoins Moonta Crescent, where Goodwin had lived.</p> 
  <p>On Tuesday, Det Insp Andrew Macrae said it was “a tragedy that Susan’s family have spent the last 23 years without answers”.</p> 
  <p>Goodwin was last seen about lunchtime on 19 July, 2002 after shopping at Coles and Woolworths in Port Lincoln.</p> 
  <p>In 2017, police said a public appeal for information had led to seven persons of interest being cleared by the investigation.</p> 
  <p>A reward of up to $200,000 is offered for information leading to the conviction of Goodwin’s killer and/or information that leads to the recovery of her remains.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welcome</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m <strong>Martin Farrer</strong> with the stories making the headlines first thing, before I pass the baton on to <strong>Nick Visser</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The big news today is expected to be the Albanese government announcing its carbon emissions target for the next decade. But before we get that, there’s plenty of other news around.</p> 
  <p>Australia’s jobs market is forecast to remain in good health, despite the prospect that the latest figures due out this morning will show a rise in the unemployment rate. Economists don’t think it will affect interest rates, although there could be a knock-on from the US Fed’s decision overnight to cut rates for the first time since December. More coming up.</p> 
  <p>Police in South Australia have charged a man with murder, hours after bones were found during a search for the remains of a woman who vanished more than 20 years ago. More coming up on that too.</p> 
  <p>And a $30bn takeover bid for Australian gas giant Santos has been withdrawn at the last minute after a consortium led by the UAE’s state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company reconsidered its offer.</p>
