<h2><strong>Automatic promotion contenders</strong></h2> <p>This week the tussle between <strong>Birmingham</strong><strong> City</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>Ipswich</strong><strong> Town</strong>, who meet in the curtain-raiser on Friday, to sign Chuba Akpom – the runaway top scorer in the division with Middlesbrough three years ago (Viktor Gyökeres was runner-up) – was tantamount to both sides taking it in turns to flex their muscles. Despite a sole Premier League win this calendar year, Ipswich were relegated with more decorum than <strong>Leicester</strong><strong> City</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>Southampton </strong>and Kieran McKenna’s side are armed to attack the second tier, even if Omari Hutchinson joins Liam Delap in departing.</p> <p>The 40-year-old Ashley Young, who worked with McKenna at Manchester United, looks a smart pickup and consistency can help Ipswich to flourish. Birmingham, meanwhile, are aiming to repeat a feat last achieved by Ipswich in winning successive promotions and have not been shy in reinforcing Chris Davies’s squad, but there is also momentum from a record-breaking season. Leicester are at risk of a points deduction but their new head coach, Martí Cifuentes, took 32 players on the pre-season tour to Austria and has the tools to overpower opponents. The landscape of his squad will probably look different next month&nbsp;– the same applies at Southampton where a flurry of departures are expected – but, unlike last season, neither are likely&nbsp;to be caught short. For Will Still, the returning Gavin Bazunu and Shea Charles could be key pillars at&nbsp;Saints.</p> <p>Eleven teams have changed managers since the end of last season – 15 since the turn of the year – but few transitions were as messy as Rúben Sellés replacing Chris Wilder at <strong>Sheffield United</strong>, playoff finalists last season. Selles, who has reunited with Louie Barry, with whom he worked at Hull City last season, has the bones of a strong squad but will need to hit the ground running to win over the Bramall Lane faithful. One of those coaches who arrived midway through last campaign will fancy his chances of kicking on: Frank Lampard revived <strong>Coventry</strong><strong> City</strong>, driving&nbsp;them into the playoffs. The arrival of the goalkeeper Carl Rushworth, on loan from Brighton, addresses a&nbsp;problem position, though they are&nbsp;short of a prolific goalscorer – the Gyökeres sell-on fee may help.</p> <h2><strong>Playoff hopefuls</strong></h2> <p><strong>Millwall</strong> felt an uplift after Alex Neil was appointed last December and his team are primed to go close again after finishing eighth last season, with Alfie Doughty their standout summer signing. <strong>Derby</strong><strong> County</strong><strong> </strong>could be dark horses under John Eustace, who has proved his ability as a shrewd manager at this level and plans to fuse experience with youth; Rhian Brewster, 25, could prove a revelation if he can rediscover his goalscoring touch after joining on a free. Whether <strong>West Brom</strong> are in the mix under Ryan Mason, as he begins his first permanent job as a No 1, may hinge on their marquee summer signing Aune Heggebø firing after arriving from Brann.</p>    <p>After an underwhelming season, <strong>Norwich</strong><strong> City</strong><strong> </strong>have sold their top scorer Borja Sainz to Porto, while Josh Sargent – arguably the best striker in the division last term – is also poised to depart. Norwich had a soft centre last season and have revamped things with Liam Manning joining as head coach and 11 signings, including the 21-year-old striker Jovon Makama from Lincoln and the imposing Serbia midfielder Mirko Topic. This is <strong>Middlesbrough’s</strong> ninth successive season in the division and Steve Gibson has turned to Rob Edwards in search of promotion. <strong>Stoke</strong><strong> City</strong>, too, have been stuck in the second tier – and fortunate to avoid dropping into the third – but Mark Robins has strengthened with defensive additions Aaron Cresswell and Maksym Talovierov, who impressed for Plymouth after signing in January.</p> <p><strong>Swansea</strong><strong> City</strong><strong>’s</strong> highest-profile summer arrival has been Snoop Dogg, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/17/snoop-dogg-buys-stake-in-swansea-city-fc">joining Luka Modric as a minority shareholder</a>, but Alan Sheehan is aiming to build on the promise shown after taking the reins in February, initially on an interim basis. Swansea have made some sensible additions including Ethan Galbraith, who excelled for Leyton Orient, but probably need another striker unless Bobby Wales – born in Dublin, signed from the Scottish club Kilmarnock and now playing in England’s second tier – proves a hit. <strong>Bristol City</strong> squeezed into sixth on the final day last season and while Emil Jakobsen looks an upgrade on Nahki Wells, they do not look stronger under Gerhard Struber, last seen in this division in tears after staving off relegation behind closed doors with Barnsley in 2020. John Swift has signed for hometown club <strong>Portsmouth</strong>, who can build on 16th under the impressive John Mousinho. <strong>Charlton</strong> and <strong>Wrexham </strong>have been aggressive in the market after promotion and have cause to look up, towards mid-table, rather than down; for the latter, Danny Ward, Conor Coady, Lewis O’Brien and Kieffer Moore represent a promising spine.</p> <h2><strong>Relegation candidates</strong></h2> <p>After a summer exodus it is over to Henrik Pedersen, Danny Röhl’s former assistant, to pick up the pieces at <strong>Sheffield Wednesday</strong>, a club shrouded in uncertainty amid further turbulence under Dejphon Chansiri. There is crisis around every corner at Hillsborough, where the North Stand has been closed because of structural concerns, and the remaining players spent much of pre-season training on an artificial pitch amid delays at their Middlewood Road training base.</p>    <p>The longstanding captain, Barry Bannan, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/02/barry-bannan-commits-to-crisis-hit-sheffield-wednesday-family">has agreed to stay</a> but aside from his commitment positives have been hard to come by. Wednesday fans are united, however, with the supporters’ trust planning a protest at Leicester on Sunday, their opening game, where the team will be backed by a sold-out away end. <strong>Hull,</strong> like Wednesday, are prohibited from spending fees on players until January 2027 – both clubs are appealing against that ruling – and after staying up on goal difference things look ominous for the the lowest scorers of last season; Sergej Jakirovic is the fifth managerial hire since Acun Ilicali took ownership three years ago.</p> <p><strong>Blackburn</strong><strong> Rovers</strong> missed out on the playoffs on the final day last season but were punching above their weight and look light on quality after Callum Brittain joined Boro. <strong>Oxford United</strong>, who spent pre-season in Indonesia, where Gary Rowett rode a model lion in line with local tradition, and Paul Heckingbottom’s <strong>Preston</strong> face an uphill task, but both are canny operators. Stability has been elusive at <strong>QPR</strong> and <strong>Watford </strong>– both of whom have new managers without EFL experience in Julien Stéphan and Paulo Pezzolano respectively – and could find the going tough.</p> <h2>Three youngsters to watch</h2> <p><strong>Jeremy Monga, Leicester, 16</strong> One of few green shoots from last season, the England Under-16 winger became the second-youngest player in Premier League history (behind Ethan Nwaneri) when he made his debut aged 15 years and 271 days in April; gambling regulations meant he wore a blank shirt because Leicester’s home kit was sponsored by a cryptocurrency platform. Tracked by elite clubs across Europe, but has agreed to sign a professional contract when he turns 17 next July.</p>    <p><strong>Mihailo Ivanovic, Millwall, 20</strong> The Serbia striker is one of the most exciting talents in the division and will quietly fancy his chances of the golden boot – if he stays put. Ivanovic, who signed from Vojvodina on deadline day last summer, scored 12 league goals last season – 10 since the turn of the year – including a sumptuous <em>trivela</em> at Luton. The forward got a chipped pass under his spell with his left shoulder, controlled the ball with his right boot and then flung a nonchalant strike into the far corner.</p> <p><strong>Jay Robinson, Southampton, 18 </strong>Last season it was Tyler Dibling given a chance to impress after lighting up pre-season and now it could be the turn of another attacking midfielder. Robinson, like Dibling, represented the under-21s at 15. The former QPR youngster, first elevated to the first team by Russell Martin, has been a fixture in friendlies this summer and there is a sense that a regular spot awaits. He started the final game of last season after his debut in April, the month he signed a new four-year contract.</p>
