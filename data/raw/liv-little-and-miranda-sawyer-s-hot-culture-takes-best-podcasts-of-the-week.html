<h2>Pick of the week<br>We Have Notes</h2> <p>Observer critic Miranda Sawyer and gal-dem founder Liv Little team up to <a href="https://observer.co.uk/listen/we-have-notes">give their takes</a> on the cultural zeitgeist, each bringing their own interests to cover everything from reality TV to fine art. First up, Little charts the massive rise of former Little Mixer Jade Thirlwall (“the girlies are loving her”), while Sawyer explores how true crime revolutionised podcasting and exploded into documentaries, drama and more. <em>Hollie Richardson</em><br><em>Widely available, episodes weekly</em></p> <h2>Wisecrack</h2> <p>It begins as a standup comedy set and morphs into a true-crime investigation. What’s the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/wisecrack/id1831347408">story behind</a> Edd Hedges’s Edinburgh show about the real-life murderer who tried to break into his house – after killing his own family only a couple of doors away? This twisty, mood-shifting listen is rapidly becoming a word-of-mouth hit, for good reason. <em>Alexi Duggins</em><br><em>Widely available, episodes weekly</em></p> <h2>The Romesh Ranganathan Show</h2>    <p>This <a href="https://www.romeshranganathan.co.uk/the-romesh-ranganathan-show/">new video podcast</a> from the ubiquitous comic sees him have a sit-down chat with celebrities. First up it’s Michael Sheen, who is also questioned by Ranganathan’s mum (via a question she dials in with) and members of the production crew, as he talks bodily fluids, naked buttocks and Welsh rugby. <em>AD</em><br><em>Widely available, episodes weekly</em></p> <h2>Kawps</h2> <p>Racist facial recognition, Ice detentions, the mistreatment of people with mental health problems … it’s safe to say that the topics <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3oIQmtFA4iTGPa1LfvtYCF">Kawps</a> covers don’t immediately sound hilarious. Gladly, Jaffer Khan and Ashton Womack’s podcast punches up not down in its quest to “[turn] America’s policing nightmare into weekly satire”, deftly spotlighting unbelievably poor conduct. <em>Hannah J Davies</em><br><em>Widely available, episodes weekly</em></p> <h2>What Are We Even Doing?</h2> <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4it4cnEsB8ihRb0bqSUHYj">This pod</a> by Kyle MacLachlan has a sweet premise, as the David Lynch disciple turned “internet’s favourite dad” swaps advice with younger creatives. The first episode is with model, actor and noted nepo baby Kaia Gerber who, at least, doesn’t pretend that having Cindy Crawford as a parent wasn’t something of a leg-up. <em>HJD</em><br><em>Widely available, episodes weekly</em></p>
