<p>How the Brownlow medal is decided has come under fresh scrutiny after a controversial vote at the 2025 count on Monday left those in the audience at the glitzy ceremony in Melbourne visibly stunned.</p> <p>Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera’s outstanding individual performance during St Kilda’s remarkable round 20 win over Melbourne was widely hailed at the time as the greatest of the season – and perhaps even the best seen in recent memory.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/22/gold-coast-suns-matt-rowell-pulls-off-brownlow-medal-upset">Gold Coast Suns’ Matt Rowell pulls off Brownlow medal upset</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet when AFL CEO Andrew Dillon read out the results, which gave the young Saints star just two votes instead of the expected three, there were audible jeers of derision from the crowd.</p> <p>Wanganeen-Milera appeared surprised, but afforded himself a wry smile, while others around the room, including Max Gawn and Christian Petracca on the Melbourne table, could only laugh out loud at the decision to give their teammate Jack Viney three votes instead.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/17/from-the-pocket-newsletter-afl-weekly-footy-email-from-jonathan-horn-guardian-australia-sign-up-subscribe">During finals sign up for our free weekly AFL newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Brownlow polling is in the hands of the field umpires, who allocate their 3-2-1 votes at the end of each game. The officials, who have a different view of the game to those watching from other vantage points, are not permitted to review player stats before they do so, nor change their votes once submitted.</p> <p>Wanganeen-Milera was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/27/st-kilda-pull-off-greatest-comeback-in-aflvfl-history-against-melbourne">the architect of a scarcely believable 46-point turnaround</a> in the game against Melbourne, having 34 disposals, nine score involvements and six clearances, and kicking four goals, including two in the final 10 seconds.
