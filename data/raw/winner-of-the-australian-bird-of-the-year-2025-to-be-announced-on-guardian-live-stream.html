<p>The poll closed at 6am on Wednesday. On the final day of voting, the tally board is hidden from public view.</p> 
<p>The official top 10 vying for the bird of the year title – in order of their place in the poll on Monday – are:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li><p>Tawny frogmouth</p></li> 
 <li><p>Baudin’s black cockatoo</p></li> 
 <li><p>Gang-gang cockatoo</p></li> 
 <li><p>Willie wagtail</p></li> 
 <li><p>Bush stone-curlew</p></li>

 <li><p>Little penguin</p></li> 
 <li><p>Spotted pardalote</p></li> 
 <li><p>Wedge-tailed eagle</p></li> 
</ol> 
<p>If history is anything to go by, there are often last-minute surprises for birds perched on the top of the tally board.</p> 
<p>The crowd favourite, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/08/tawny-frogmouths-take-patience-to-appreciate-but-they-will-reward-you-with-insights-into-their-remarkable-lives">tawny frogmouth</a>, has landed in second place for the past three competitions. In the final stages of the 2023 competition, it also led the vote. But the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/06/australian-bird-of-the-year-2023-winner-announced-swift-parrot">swift parrot</a> soared past it on the final day of voting – when the vote tally is hidden – to snatch the crown.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/05/western-australia-baudin-black-cockatoo-wont-survive-mining-expansion">Baudin’s black cockatoo</a> – a newcomer to the poll this year – roosted in second place on Monday. The dark-feathered, white-cheeked bird with a call like a squeaky gate is endemic to the Western Australia’s south-west. But conservationists fear the species is under greater pressure than ever due to planned expansions of bauxite mining in its native northern jarrah forests.</p> 
<p>In third place on Monday was the gang-gang cockatoo – beloved for its distinctive call that sounds like a creaky door. It has placed third in the past two competitions.</p> 
<p>This year it has been backed by Guardian Australia’s editor, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPR34XLDVRi/?hl=en">Lenore Taylor</a>, the independent senator <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPdP1SvgUHl/">David Pocock </a>and Gardening Australia’s host, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPftwTcCeMn/">Costa Georgiadi</a>.</p> 
<p>For the first time ever this year, the magpie – the winner of the inaugural 2017 poll – was booted from the top 10.</p> 
<p>This year’s champion will join the ranks of previous winners: the Australian magpie, the black-throated finch, the superb fairy-wren and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2023/sep/25/australian-bird-of-the-year-2023-vote-the-guardian-bird-life-australia-poll"> the swift parrot</a>.</p>
