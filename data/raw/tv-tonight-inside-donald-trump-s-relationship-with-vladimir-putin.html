<h2>Dispatches: Trump – Moscow’s Man in the White House</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>This film promises to be an explosive behind-the-scenes investigation into the biggest political story of the decade – and Dispatches always delivers on its word. Former US intelligence officials and White House insiders speak out about Donald Trump’s relationship with Vladimir Putin to help answer the questions: what is really underpinning it? And what will happen next? <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Supercruising: Life at Sea</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>This behind-the-scenes peek at life aboard two luxury cruise ships heads to very different locations this week. In one, the navigation crew stress about getting their craft through the locks of the Panama Canal while passengers whip out phones for pics. Over in Tenerife, it’s whale-watching time. <em>Alexi Duggins</em></p> <h2>The Great Fire of London With Rob Rinder &amp; Ruth Goodman</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong></p> <p>Rob and Ruth continue to be captivating history teachers as they ask what living during the Great Fire of London was like on both sides of the wealth line. Rob steps into the shoes of diarist Samuel Pepys and the city’s Lord Mayor, while Ruth explores the reality of being a widowed innkeeper with five mouths to feed. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>The Walking Dead: Dead City</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Max</strong></p> <p>Now that his baseball bat has been upgraded with an electroshock function, surely the listless Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is ready to be a hammy villain again? A cowboy faction attempting to invade zombified New York by boat seems like a perfect opportunity for the leather-clad baddie to get back into the swing of things. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Outrageous</h2> <p><strong>9pm, U&amp;Drama</strong></p>    <p>Bessie Carter is best known as Prudence Featherington in Bridgerton, but she’s great here as Nancy Mitford narrating the turbulent lives of her family. While Nancy deals with inferior-husband problems, her sister Diana makes plans to marry Oswald Mosley while Unity defends her friendship with Adolf Hitler. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Such Brave Girls</h2> <p><strong>10pm, BBC Three</strong></p> <p>There are at least two feckless men hanging around the house and an unwanted boat in the front garden – could motherhood be the answer? Kat Sadler’s comedy concludes with babies – stolen, borrowed and imagined – in the mix as the girls hit the casino. It’s resolutely rude, ridiculous and very funny. <em>Jack Seale</em></p>
