<h1>Uefa gives ‘reluctant’ approval for domestic games to be played abroad this season</h1>

<p>Uefa has granted permission for La Liga and Serie A to stage a game each abroad this winter, meaning European league games will be played on different continents for the first time, in a potentially incendiary move.</p> 
<p>The governing body’s go-ahead means that, pending the formality of Fifa approval, Barcelona will face Villarreal in Miami this December in a move that breaks with decades of tradition across the continent. Milan have also been permitted to play Como in Perth, Australia, in February. Uefa, though, claims its go-ahead will not herald a torrent of similar relocations, saying its hands have been tied by gaps in football’s regulations.</p> 
<p>In a statement Uefa said it had “reiterated its clear opposition to domestic league matches being played outside their home country”, adding: “However, given that the relevant Fifa regulatory framework – currently under review – is not clear and detailed enough, the Uefa executive committee has reluctantly taken the decision to approve, on an exceptional basis, the two requests referred to it.”</p>

<p>It is the latest contentious step in a saga that has inflamed passions across the sport. Uefa’s executive committee was due to vote on the proposals last month and the Guardian understands it was invited to give its approval. But, amid a backlash from supporters’ groups and criticism from within the European Commission, it opted to engage in a “round of consultation” before reaching a final decision.</p> 
<p>The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, sought to allay concerns that the dam has been burst by a move that could change the face of football. “League matches should be played on home soil; anything else would disenfranchise loyal match-going fans and potentially introduce distortive elements in competitions,” he said. “Our consultation confirmed the breadth of these concerns.</p> 
<p>“While it is regrettable to have to let these two games go ahead, this decision is exceptional and shall not be seen as setting a precedent. Our commitment is clear: to protect the integrity of national leagues and ensure that football remains anchored in its home environment.”</p> 
<p>Senior figures in Uefa believe there was no choice but to take a stance that they believe is pragmatic. High among the considerations was that a legal standoff with the plan’s proponents could have resulted and, should that have been lost, the floodgates could have opened. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa">Uefa</a> said its national associations had agreed to engage with it before submitting any future requests but the sport still looks highly vulnerable to similar scenarios unfolding unless all stakeholders show sufficient appetite to bolt the door.</p> 
<p>That was first prised open last year when the US-based promoter Relevent Sports agreed a settlement with Fifa, dismissing the global governing body from a lawsuit contesting its policy banning league games from taking place overseas. Fifa had previously blocked a request from Relevent in 2018 to stage a match between Barcelona and Girona in Miami, although no substantive moves to close any regulatory loopholes appear to have been made in the intervening years. A working group established in 2024 to examine the rules has yet to form any conclusions. This year Relevent was awarded the global commercial rights to Uefa’s club competitions for the 2027-2033 cycle.</p> 
<p>Football Supporters Europe acknowledged Uefa’s show of opposition to the principle of hosting domestic games abroad but pressed football’s authorities to rule out any repeat. “The onus is now on Fifa to plug this regulatory gap,” it said. “We welcome Uefa’s commitment to work with Fifa to ensure that future rules uphold the integrity of domestic competitions.”</p> 
<p>FSE also urged La Liga and Serie A to withdraw their plans to host games on foreign soil and “act for the greater good of football”.</p> 
<p>The Premier League’s stance is that it will not follow La Liga and Serie A in requesting to relocate domestic fixtures.</p>
