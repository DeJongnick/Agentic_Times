<p>Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary, has asked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> for advice on a range of work-related issues, including why British businesses are not adopting artificial intelligence and what podcasts he should appear on.</p> <p>Information provided to the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2472068-revealed-how-the-uk-tech-secretary-uses-chatgpt-for-policy-advice/">New Scientist</a> magazine in response to a freedom of information request showed that Kyle, an advocate for AI within the government, makes frequent use of OpenAI’s chat tool in his professional life.</p> <p>The responses show Kyle asked for media and policy advice, and to define scientific terms relevant to his department, including “antimatter”, “quantum” and “digital inclusion”.</p> <p>Experts say the fact the information was provided could open the door to similar information having to be disclosed across Whitehall.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “As the cabinet minister responsible for AI, the secretary of state does make use of this technology. This does not substitute comprehensive advice he routinely receives from officials.</p> <p>“The government is using AI as a labour-saving tool – supported by clear guidance on how to quickly and safely make use of the technology.”</p> <p>Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/13/keir-starmer-abolishes-nhs-england-executive-body">gave a speech</a> on Thursday promising widespread changes to the civil service, including greater use of AI.</p> <p>“If we push forward with digital reform of government – and we are going to do that – we can make massive savings, £45bn savings in efficiency,” the prime minister said. “AI is a golden opportunity.”</p> <p>Kyle has championed initiatives within government, which include spearheading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/22/elton-john-calls-for-uk-copyright-rules-rethink-to-protect-creators-from-ai">controversial plans</a> to exempt AI companies from copyright rules so they can access creative content for free.</p> <p>Some critics <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14421907/Starry-eyed-minister-whos-captured-Big-Tech-bros-just-three-months-Peter-Kyle-30-meetings-AI-firms-NONE-Britains-vital-creative-sector-GUY-ADAMS-investigates.html">have accused him</a> of being too close to the industry, pointing out that while Kyle was in opposition, a staff member from the AI company Faculty AI was seconded to his office.</p> <p>In January, the technology secretary <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/tech-secretary-says-take-flack-ai-expansion-goes-wrong">told PoliticsHome</a> he would often use ChatGPT “to try and understand the broader context where an innovation came from, the people who developed it, the organisations behind them”.</p> <p>He added: “ChatGPT is fantastically good, and where there are things that you really struggle to understand in depth, ChatGPT can be a very good tutor for it.”</p> <p>He previously <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/labour-peter-kyle-reading-age-c9hwtdknz">told the Times</a>: “AI can tutor you. So for example, I can go into a chatbot and say ‘What is quantum mechanics and what are its applications?’, and it can come up with a description, it will tutor you.”</p> <p>When New Scientist asked for his ChatGPT prompts and answers the department initially refused, saying the information would include conversations made in a personal and official capacity. When the magazine explained it wanted to see those made in an official capacity, the department supplied the information.</p> <p>According to the exchanges, Kyle asked why small- and medium-sized businesses had been so slow to take up AI.</p> <p>The chatbot replied: “While the UK government has launched initiatives to encourage AI adoption, many SMBs are unaware of these programs or find them difficult to navigate. Limited access to funding or incentives to de-risk AI investment can also deter adoption.”</p> <p>On another occasion, Kyle asked: “I’m secretary of state for science, innovation and technology in the United Kingdom. What would be the best podcasts for me to appear on to reach a wide audience that’s appropriate for my ministerial responsibilities?”</p> <p>ChatGPT suggested <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00snr0w">The Infinite Monkey Cage</a> and <a href="https://www.thenakedscientists.com/">The Naked Scientists</a>.</p> <p>Some have said using ChatGPT in this way poses policy risks.</p> <p>Beeban Kidron, the film director and member of the House of Lords who is leading the opposition to the government’s AI copyright plans, said: “I am a bit worried that the science and innovation department is bedazzled with technical developments and not doing enough to protect UK democratic and economic interests.”</p>
