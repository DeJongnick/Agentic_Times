  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The leaders of the Coalition of the Willing have finalised a plan for potential security guarantees for Ukraine,</strong> with 26 countries declaring readiness to get directly involved, French president <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> said after a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing in Paris (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/04/ukraine-russia-security-guarantees-coalition-of-the-willing-paris-europe-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68b99efb8f08bb514e0fc1fa#block-68b99efb8f08bb514e0fc1fa">16:25</a>).</p></li> 
   <li><p>The <strong>plan will be now taken to the US with the intention of formalising it in the coming days</strong>, Macron said (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/04/ukraine-russia-security-guarantees-coalition-of-the-willing-paris-europe-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68b9a5478f08b5e63ea78067#block-68b9a5478f08b5e63ea78067">16:46</a>).</p></li>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Finland’s president <strong>Alexander Stubb</strong> said president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> in a call with European leaders on Thursday <strong>suggested the US and Europe should act together on further sanctions against Russia</strong>, and <strong>that sanctions on oil and gas were up for discussion.</strong></p> 
  <p>“Trump’s approach was very much that <strong>we must act together on sanctions policy</strong> and now <strong>look for ways in particular to halt Russia’s war machine by economic means,</strong>” Stubb told Finnish media after the meeting, Reuters reported.</p> 
  <p>“In that case <strong>there are two targets, namely oil and gas</strong>. The President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and President Trump’s close advisers will discuss this over the next 24 hours,” Stubb said.</p>

  <p>Asked about some of the countries that previously signalled their opposition to being part of a deployment to Ukraine – including <strong>Poland</strong> and <strong>Italy</strong> – <strong>Macron</strong> sidesteps the question and says that there are different roles that can be performed, and effectively refuses to detail which country committed to what.</p>

  <p><strong>Zelenskyy</strong> <strong>says the key to ending the war is to deprive “the Russian war machine” of resources,</strong> as he talks about the need to put more pressure – including economic sanctions – on Moscow.</p> 
  <p>He also says that Ukraine is particularly keen to secure “maximum protection” of its skies to “save lives” and protect the Ukrainians from nightly attacks by Russia.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Zelenskyy talks about 'concrete plans' being made to guarantee Ukraine's security</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Zelenskyy</strong> says the intention is clear, “to finish this war as soon as possible” and allow for diplomatic talks, while guaranteeing Ukraine’s long-term security guarantees.</p> 
  <p>He <strong>points out that Russia’s Putin has so far rejected all calls for peace talks</strong>, and “his behaviour shows that putting pressure on him doesn’t work, but we think it is to the contrary” as he talks about the impact of sanctions on the Russian economy.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy says that <strong>a strong Ukrainian army is “the central element of security guarantees,”</strong> with talks on training, and production and procurement of weapons.</p> 
  <p>He says <strong>the security guarantees plan</strong> – the framework of which has now been agreed today – <strong>includes “concrete steps,”</strong> and leaders are now deciding which country will help in which area, <strong>including in cyber, and air defence.</strong></p> 
  <p>He adds that <strong>“European weapon production lines are not working enough,”</strong> as he calls for more investment in this area to make them work at full capacity.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Macron says security guarantees 'ready' with 26 ready to take part, coalition ready to coordinate further sanctions on Russia with US</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Macron</strong> begins by saying that <strong>“our message remains that” Ukraine is on the side of peace, and Russia needs to be called out as the aggressor.</strong></p> 
  <p>He says that <strong>Russia appears to be</strong> “acting with the consent of many of its partners around the world,” as it is <strong>attempting to delay the peace process and continue attacking Ukraine.</strong></p> 
  <p>Macron stresses <strong>the need for security guarantees for Ukraine,</strong> as he talks about the process led by defence chiefs and planners that “laid the groundwork” for the guarantees.</p> 
  <p>He says <strong>the guarantees are now ready,</strong> clarifying the military and political engagement from the 35 members, to provide Ukraine with the support it needs.</p> 
  <p>“The key argument here is that <strong>there are no limitations for the defence of Ukraine,</strong>” he says, stressing the need to “regenerate” the Ukrainian army to “resist” Russian attacks and deter it from planning another attack.</p> 
  <p>He says <strong>26 countries are ready to be involved “on land, in the sea or in the air”</strong> to “reassure the people of Ukraine and maintain the ceasefire once it’s implemented, and maintain and guarantee peace.”</p> 
  <p>Macron also <strong>confirms the leaders spoke with the US president Trump.</strong></p> 
  <p>He says “the conclusions are very simple,” with plans to finalise the agreed US support in the coming days.</p> 
  <p>He adds that <strong>“we are also ready to coordinate our efforts in order to stop the war efforts from Russia.”</strong></p> 
  <p>He says the Europeans want a series of meetings – first between Zelenskyy and Putin, and later in another format – to bring the war to a close, and <strong>“if Moscow doesn’t want to respect these conditions, we will have to take further steps with the US.”</strong></p> 
  <p>He claims <strong>Trump has confirmed he would join the coalition in taking action should Russia fail to act.</strong></p> 
  <p>“We cannot [allow for] international law to be violated. We cannot, because this is not only Ukraine; this is the security of all of us,” he says.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Let’s look at <strong>some further reactions from European leaders</strong> after the first part of the Paris summit, before they call US president Donald Trump shortly.</p> 
  <p>Ireland’s prime minister <strong>Micheál Martin</strong> issued a statement saying the talks “focussed on making further progress on the security guarantees for Ukraine that will be needed to underpin any ceasefire or peace agreement.”</p> 
  <p>He said these <strong>guarantees could take “a number of forms, from an ‘assurance force’</strong> that some countries are ready to join <strong>to further training for the Ukrainian Defence Forces.”</strong></p> 
  <p>He also said that <strong>it could “include a role for peacekeepers</strong> in ensuring that a ceasefire or peace agreement is observed,” <strong>with Ireland “open to participating in an appropriately mandated mission of this kind.”</strong></p> 
  <p>Croatia’s <strong>Andrej Plenković </strong>also spoke about the need to continue offering “comprehensive assistance to Ukraine,” and stressed the need to support Ukraine’s plans to join the EU.</p> 
  <p>Estonia’s <strong>Kristen Michal</strong> said that while <strong>“Putin hopes his games tire the democratic world, our unity and resolve have proven otherwise.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“Security guarantees must be defined by those who seek and provide them. Russia has no say in Ukraine’s future – or the future of Europe and Nato,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Spain’s <strong>Pedro Sánchez</strong>, grounded in Madrid after his plane broke down (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/04/ukraine-russia-security-guarantees-coalition-of-the-willing-paris-europe-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68b946af8f08bb514e0fbd70#block-68b946af8f08bb514e0fbd70">10:12</a>), also called for “transatlantic unity,” saying it was “more necessary than ever,” as he urged partners to make no concessions to Russian aggression.</p> 
  <p>Lithuania’s <strong>Gitanas Nausėda</strong> stressed that “guarantees must provide real deterrence, not another Budapest Memorandum.”</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Britain’s prime minister <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> told other leaders of the Coalition of the Willing that <strong>Putin “could not be trusted” as Russia continues to delay peace talks and carry out attacks on Ukraine.</strong></p> 
  <p>“That was <strong>further underlined by the indiscriminate attacks in Kyiv last week</strong>, causing significant damage to the British Council and EU delegation buildings,” he added, according to a government readout.</p> 
  <p>Starmer also stressed that <strong>the coalition “had an unbreakable pledge to Ukraine, with president Trump’s backing,”</strong> and told leader <strong>it was clear they “now needed to go even further to apply pressure on Putin to secure a cessation of hostilities.”</strong></p> 
  <p> He also welcomed announcements from other coalition members that they would supply long range missiles to Ukraine “to further bolster the country’s supplies.”</p> 
  <p>Starmer wasn’t in Paris, but dialled in online, it was confirmed.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Up to us to design guarantees to back Ukraine, Nato's Rutte says, as he warns against being 'naive' about Russia</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Nato’s <strong>Rutte</strong> is speaking now and he <strong>opens by heaping praise on the Czech Republic</strong> as a reliable member of the alliance.</p> 
  <p>He then talks about Nato’s defence spending ramp up in recent months to deal with “the threats we face, including from <strong>Russia, which we all know is not only a challenge today, but for the long term.</strong>”</p> 
  <p>On Ukraine, he says that <strong>“we’re all pushing for an end to Russia’s war against Ukraine and a just and lasting peace.”</strong></p> 
  <p>Commenting on the meeting of the Coalition of the Willing he just took part in, he largely repeat what he said earlier this morning (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/04/ukraine-russia-security-guarantees-coalition-of-the-willing-paris-europe-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68b949ee8f08020a75f13394#block-68b949ee8f08020a75f13394">10:18</a>) as he says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“This started as president Trump breaking the deadlock with Putin [by] engaging with him, and therefore <strong>[it is] now for us to design the security guarantees as Europeans and Canada with the US to make sure that when [these] talks start, the Ukrainian president knows that he has the full backing</strong> of the US, of Canada, the Europeans, all of us in Nato, but also countries outside Nato.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He says the “primary” security guarantee will have to be the Ukrainian army, but “on top of that, also these security guarantees.”</p> 
  <p>He also strongly repeats his point that Europe should “not be naive” about Russia.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>The facts are there.</strong> <strong>Russia is investing 40% of its state budget on defence.</strong> And of course, <strong>you sometimes here and there have a nice parade, but that’s not why they are investing all that money.</strong> </em></p> 
   <p><em>They are investing it because <strong>they want to be successful in Ukraine</strong>, and we have to prevent them from being successful. <strong>But beyond Ukraine, it will not stop.</strong> </em></p> 
   <p><em>We have seen recent announcements and comments by senior military and also intelligence leaders in Europe saying that <strong>Russia might be ready by 2027, by 2029 some are saying by 2030 2031 to really, if they would choose so try to attack Nato territory.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>We <strong>have to make sure that our deterrence is such that they will never try</strong>, knowing that our reaction will be devastating.</em></p> 
   <p><em>That is yes, money, because we need more men and women in uniform, but also yes, production because production capacity, also here the Czech Republic, is very important because of your overall … history and still very much presence when it comes to defence industrial production … .</em></p> 
   <p><em>To everybody watching this, <strong>please, men and women, citizens of the Czech Republic and all over Europe, Canada and the US:</strong> <strong>let’s not be naive about Russia.</strong> </em></p> 
   <p><em>We know what Putin tries to do, and the evidence is there in Ukraine as we speak, and it is there, <strong>that’s threat [is] for the long term,</strong> I’m afraid.”</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Complete consensus' on Coalition of the Willing's support for Ukraine, Czech Republic's Fiala says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Czech prime minister <strong>Petr Fiala </strong>and Nato secretary general <strong>Mark Rutte</strong> are making the best use of the break in the Coalition of the Willing’s meeting by <strong>hosting</strong> <strong>a</strong> <strong>joint press conference</strong>, marking the alliance’s boss visit to the wonderful city of Prague.</p> 
  <p>Fiala says it was “an important online meeting,” showing <strong>“a complete consensus”</strong> on further support for Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>He says the leaders agreed “that <strong>we need to continue our intensive help to Ukraine</strong> in order to be able to defend itself and continue the pressure on Russia, and to create conditions for a fair and enduring peace.”</p> 
  <p>“In order to achieve peace, and t<strong>here is also a strong consensus on that there must be robust security guarantees,</strong> which would deter Russia from further aggression,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He also adds that under his tenure, the Czech Republic has turned from “a free rider” into a reliable Nato ally, ramping up defence spending and ammunition production.</p> 
  <p>(Context: We are just a month away from the parliamentary elections in the Czech Republic, which is why he’s so keenly talking about the achievements of his government.)</p>

  <p><strong>The Paris meeting of the Coalition of the Willing on Ukraine is still on-going</strong>, with a number of leaders joining online.</p> 
  <p>Let me take you inside the room:</p> 
  <p>Curiously, AP quoted a source saying that US special envoy <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong> joined the leaders for a bit to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, and you can see him in the pictures, sitting in the corner near the host, Emmanuel Macron.</p> 
  <p>Reuters also reported that he was expected to have a one-on-one meeting with Ukraine’s <strong>Zelenskyy</strong> during the day.</p> 
  <p>You would imagine that’s part of the preparation for their phone call with US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> later today.</p> 
  <p>There is <strong>a lunch break around now</strong>, with Zelenskyy the first to leave minutes ago, but there’s more planned for the afternoon.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Sweden reports 'sharp increase' in GPS interference affecting civil aviation</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Sweden has reported a “sharp increase” in GPS interference over the Baltic Sea in 2025</strong>, saying it receives “almost daily” reports of incidents affecting aircraft in the area.</p> 
  <p>The new data, <a href="https://www.transportstyrelsen.se/sv/om-oss/pressrum/nyhetsarkiv/2025/kraftig-okning-av-gps-storningar-i-ostersjon/">published</a> by the Swedish Transport Agency <strong>Transportstyrelsen</strong>, showed <strong>733 incidents reported this year</strong> (until 28 August), compared to <strong>495</strong> in 2024 and just <strong>55</strong> in 2023.</p> 
  <p>It added that <strong>the sources of interference has been traced to the territory of Russia.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Andreas Holmgren,</strong> the head of the unit looking at the issue, said the disruptions have increased in numbers and geographically, taking place over a larger area. </p> 
  <p>He added that <strong>the problem posed “a safety risk” for civil aviation</strong>, even if pilots had alternative systems to rely on.</p> 
  <p>The authority intends to <strong>escalate the issue at the international level</strong>, with the International Civil Aviation Organisation, or <strong>ICAO</strong>, it said.</p> 
  <p>The report comes just days after the plane carrying the European Commission’s president <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> was reportedly affected by GPS interference on approach to the airport in the Bulgarian city of <strong>Plovdiv</strong>, causing delays to her travel.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Sam Jones</strong><em><strong> </strong>in Madrid,<strong> </strong></em><strong>Helen Livingstone</strong><em>, and agencies</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Portugal has declared a day of national mourning after at least 17 people were killed and 21 others injured</strong> <strong>when one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/at-least-three-people-killed-many-injured-in-lisbon-funicular-crash">city’s famous funicular cars derailed</a> and crashed into a building on Wednesday evening.</strong></p> 
  <p>Footage showed the <strong>wreckage of the yellow-and-white car lying on its side in the narrow street it traverses.</strong> Its sides and top were crumpled, and it appeared to have crashed into a building where the road bends. Parts of the vehicle, made mostly of metal, were crushed.</p>

  <p>An emergency services spokesperson said <strong>some foreign nationals were among the dead</strong> but did not identify the victims or disclose their nationalities.</p> 
  <p>The injured people, three of whom were seriously hurt, were being treated in several hospitals in the Lisbon region. Two of the most badly injured victims died in hospital overnight, raising the initial death toll from 15 to 17.</p> 
  <p>Teams of pathologists from the National Forensics Institute worked through the night on autopsies, officials said.</p> 
  <p>Public prosecutors have <strong>launched an investigation into the cause of the crash</strong>, which happened just after 6pm on Wednesday as the evening rush hour began.</p> 
  <p>Known as <strong>Elevador da Glória</strong>, the vehicle goes up and down a steep hill in central Lisbon in tandem with one going the opposite way.</p>

 <div class="block-elements">

  <p>He says:</p>

   <p><em>“Do you really think if he would not have been elected president united states, that Italy, Canada, Spain, Slovenia, Belgium and Luxembourg would have committed to do 2% this year? Do you really think that the whole of Nato would have committed to 5% committed to 5% including 3.5% core defence spending at the Nato Summit in The Hague?”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He says it was <strong>thanks to Trump that Nato is “finally dealing with this enormous pebble in the shoe, this enormous irritant</strong> that Europeans and Canada were basically lecturing the Americans, but not spending the money.”</p> 
  <p>On Russia, <strong>he says Trump “broke the deadlock” on Ukraine</strong>, insisting that “starting that conversation with Putin was important and crucial.”</p> 
  <p>He adds:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“He took that leadership role, and <strong>it is not easy to solve this</strong>, but he is absolutely committed to doing that.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>We are now working</strong> on these security guarantees necessary <strong>to make sure that also Zelenskyy knows that if he starts into conversations with the Russians, hopefully soon, that he has the backup</strong> and that he knows that that the security guarantees will in place so that Russia, after a peace deal, will never ever again to try to invade Ukraine, so no repeat of Budapest and no repeat of the Minsk agreement.”</em></p>

  <p>He says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>Some may worry about a new arms race, but our own aim,</strong> I can tell you, <strong>is not to provoke</strong>. Our aim is to protect and to ensure that we can continue to enjoy the freedom and security that we all hold so dear, the freedom and security that Nato was founded to preserve.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He adds:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Russia’s unprovoked war against Ukraine is the most obvious example of that threat. <strong>But the threat will not end when this war does, nor is the challenge limited to Russia. China, Iran and North Korea pose challenges individually and as a result of the cooperation.</strong> Only look at the pictures from Beijing the last couple of days and the hand holding.</em></p> 
   <p><em>They are increasing their defence industrial collaboration to unprecedented levels. <strong>They are preparing for long term confrontation.</strong> And as I said earlier, the challenges we face are lasting. So we must be prepared.”</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Europe needs to produce more, faster to match Russia, Nato's Rutte says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Rutte </strong>says that despite adopting more ambitious spending targets earlier this year, “cash alone can’t provide security.”</p> 
  <p>He goes on:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“We need the capabilities, real firepower, heavy metal, as well as new tech, and that’s what our defence industry across <strong>the Alliance needs to deliver faster than ever in Europe and also in the United States.</strong> Simply all over the Alliance, we are not producing enough.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But he says “<strong>we are already turning the tide on defence production</strong>, and particularly when it comes to ammunition,” paying particular tribute to Czech Republic.</p> 
  <p>“We are gradually refilling our stocks and <strong>narrowing the production gap with Russia</strong>,” he says.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Europe shouldn't be naive about Russia's 'destabilising, confrontational' force, Nato's Rutte says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Nato’s secretary general <strong>Mark Rutte</strong> is speaking at the IISS Prague Defence Summit now.</p> 
  <p>He says <strong>he wants to talk about the need to increase European military capabilities</strong> to keep the continent safe.</p> 
  <p>He says Europe needs to respond to “<strong>Russia</strong> and <strong>China</strong> <strong>investing heavily to build up and modernise their militaries”</strong> at “a remarkable, I might say, <strong>at a staggering rate.”</strong></p> 
  <p>He says this equipment is being used against Ukraine, and while the alliance is “working to end this aggression as quickly as possible,” <strong>Europe should not be naive about the future.</strong></p> 
  <p>“<strong>This trend is not going to shift or reverse anytime soon.</strong> <strong>Russia is and for the foreseeable future, will remain, a destabilising and confrontational force in Europe</strong> and the world,” he says.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Morning opening: Where there is a will, there is a way</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The so-called <strong>Coalition of the Willing is meeting today in Paris and online for further talks on security guarantees for Ukraine</strong> in case of a peace deal with Russia.</p> 
  <p>Hosted by the French president, <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong>, a group of mostly European leaders – including Ukraine’s <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> – will discuss how to turn their <em>will</em> to help Ukraine into <em>concrete</em>, specific guarantees that would give Ukraine the confidence that any peace arrangement with Russia could hold.</p> 
  <p>Welcoming Zelenskyy last night, Macron announced that, after months of work by military planners, <strong>Europe was finally ready to provide the guarantees and would politically endorse their plan at the meeting today.</strong> Let’s see what it entails.</p> 
  <p>The leaders start arriving around 9am BST, 10am CEST for talks among themselves, before holding a call with US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> at 1pm BST/2pm CEST. <strong>We will hear what they agreed on an hour later.</strong></p> 
  <p>For what it’s worth, Trump declared last night that he had been thinking about organising a face-to-face meeting between Zelenskyy and Russia’s <strong>Vladimir Putin, </strong>but did not commit to any specific action.</p> 
  <p>“<strong>Something is going to happen, but they are not ready yet.</strong> But something is going to happen. We are going to get it done,” he told CBS.</p> 
  <p>Earlier, he told reporters at a meeting with the Polish president, <strong>Karol Nawrocki,</strong> that Putin would have to make a decision on next steps and <strong>“if we are unhappy about it, you will see things happen”.</strong></p> 
  <p><em>Whatever that means.</em></p> 
  <p>Let’s see what the day brings us. I will bring you all the key updates here.</p> 
  <p>It’s <strong>Thursday, 4 September 2025,</strong> it’s <strong>Jakub Krupa</strong> here, and this is <strong>Europe Live.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Good morning.</strong></p>
