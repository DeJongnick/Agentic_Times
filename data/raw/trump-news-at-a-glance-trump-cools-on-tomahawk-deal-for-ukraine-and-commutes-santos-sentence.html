<p>Donald Trump has played down hopes that he will supply Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles, saying during a White House meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the US may need them for a future conflict.</p> <p>Responding to a question on whether the US would send the cruise missiles requested by Ukraine, Trump said: “We need Tomahawks and we need a lot of other things that we’ve been sending over the last four years to Ukraine.</p> <p>“It’s not easy for us to give [Ukraine] … massive numbers of very powerful weapons,” he said. “Hopefully they won’t need it. Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”</p>  <h2>Putin tells Trump that Tomahawks deal would damage US-Russian relations</h2>  <p>Trump’s doubtful tone on the cruise missiles follows a surprise phone call with Vladimir Putin on Friday during which the Russian leader told Trump that supplying the Tomahawks would damage US-Russian relations. His position on supplying Ukraine with weapons has changed a number of times since he returned to office in January, often following negotiations with Putin or European backers of Ukraine.</p> <p>During the White House meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump also discussed plans to hold a bilateral meeting with Putin in Hungary, saying it was “to be determined” whether Zelenskyy would join but that he would inform him of the discussions.</p> <p>“There is a lot of bad blood,” Trump said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/17/trump-putin-phone-call-sinks-kyiv-ukraine-hopes-for-us-tomahawk-missiles"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump says he has commuted sentence of George Santos in federal fraud case</h2>  <p>Donald Trump said Friday he had commuted the sentence of George Santos, the former US representative who is serving more than seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft charges.</p> <p>The New York Republican was sentenced in April after admitting last year to deceiving donors and stealing the identities of 11 people – including his own family members – to make donations to his campaign.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/17/trump-commuted-sentence-george-santos"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Ex-Trump adviser John Bolton pleads not guilty to sharing classified information</h2>  <p>John Bolton, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump in his first term, pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges relating to diary-like notes he shared that contained top secret information with relatives and stored classified documents at his home.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/17/john-bolton-indicted-trump"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Fox News employees expressed concerns network was intentionally aiding Trump, legal filings reveal</h2>  <p>Multiple Fox News employees expressed concerns about the network’s editorial standards and the conduct of top hosts in an internal survey conducted in the summer and fall of 2020, with one going as far as to wonder if they had sold their “soul to the devil”, according to legal filings.</p> <p>The employees’ statements were excerpted in a 771-page filing released last week, made public as part of a defamation lawsuit filed against the network by voting technology company Smartmatic.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/17/fox-news-employee-survey-trump-lawsuit"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Young Republicans New York chapter suspended after racist chats leaked</h2>  <p>The New York Republican state committee has suspended the authorization of their Young Republicans chapter after members were implicated in highly offensive and racist messages that were obtained and published by Politico<em>.</em></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/17/ny-republicans-racist-chats-suspended"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump claims Maduro willing to give ‘everything’ to ease US tensions</h2>  <p>Donald Trump used an expletive to threaten the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, on Friday, claiming that the leftist autocrat had offered major concessions to appease the US.</p> <p>The US president was speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday during a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
