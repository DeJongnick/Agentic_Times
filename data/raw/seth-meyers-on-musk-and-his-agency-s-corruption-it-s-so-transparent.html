<p>Late-night hosts talked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>’s bizarre <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/elon-musk-trump-doge">Oval Office press conference</a> and their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-protest">dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></h2> <p>Though Trump promised throughout his campaign to lower grocery prices as president, to date, “we still don’t have a plan for lowering eggs prices,” said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/seth-meyers">Seth Meyers</a> on Wednesday night. “But we <em>do </em>have a plan for building hotels in Gaza.”</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGixMDhbNA"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4JGixMDhbNA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The Late Night host had a theory for why Trump remained so fixated on his “plan”, announced seemingly on a whim at a press conference, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-plan-to-take-over-gaza-strip-netanyahu-visit">to expel Palestinians</a> and build hotels: “It’s called the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> Strip, and the only other strip he knows is the Vegas Strip, so he thinks that can work there,” Meyers explained. “And if you think the people around him are going to say, ‘Actually, sir, it’s a different kind of strip,’ just remember that the people around him also suggest Red, White and Blueland” <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=15398">as an alternative name</a> for Greenland.</p> <p>“This is what Trump does,” Meyers continued. “We’ve seen it for years. It’s nothing new. He’s hoping voters will pay attention to his plans for Gaza and Greenland, and ignore what he’s doing to the rest of the government.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/12/jimmy-kimmel-trump">Jimmy Kimmel on Trump’s TV ubiquity: ‘It’s like the Jerry Lewis telethon’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such as disbanding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). After firing its employees, Musk tweeted “CFBP RIP” with a tombstone emoji. “First of all, don’t announce policy via emoji,” Meyers said. “Second, think about how corrupt this is: they’re eliminating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency that stops companies from ripping you off. It’s so transparent.” Meyers noted that Musk is in the process of turning X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter that he owns, into a peer-to-peer payment and financial services app, while also dismantling the agency that oversees payments and financial services.</p> <p>At a press conference in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Musk defended his conflicts of interest, claiming transparency via posts to the Doge handle on X. Meyers didn’t buy it – “so to find out what our government is up to, we just have to wade through a sea of Nazis, trolls, ads for Cheech &amp; Chong weed gummies and bots with women in bikinis offering to send us 1m units of something called Sex Coin as long as we send our social security and bank routing numbers.”</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxp2syaV0Vg"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Oxp2syaV0Vg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>On <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live!, the host ripped into Trump’s proposal on Gaza. “Blob the Builder is still going all in on his ridiculous and potentially disastrous plan to force nearly 2 million Palestinians who live in Gaza to go live somewhere else,” he explained. “There seems to be no thought put into this plan outside of just what he says at the press conference.”</p> <p>Asked if the Palestinians didn’t want to leave, Trump answered: “They’re going someplace beautiful, they’re going to be in love with it.”</p> <p>“This is not what you say to people you’re evicting from the place where they live!” Kimmel exclaimed. “This is what you say to your parents when you’re about to put them in a retirement home.”</p> <p>In other Trump chaos, the White House banned reporters from the Associated Press because the outlet refused to call the Gulf of Mexico by Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-executive-order-gulf-mexico">self-proclaimed new title</a>, the Gulf of America. “They’re going to keep kicking journalists out until all they have left are Fox, Newsmax, OAN, OnlyFans and Golf Digest,” Kimmel joked.</p> <p>Google and Apple Maps both fell in line, relabeling the body of water for just American users. “It’s basically the equivalent of giving Trump a binky and hoping he shuts up,” said Kimmel.</p> <h2><strong>The Daily Show</strong></h2>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1889872129543290883">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How fun! Trump celebrated &quot;Take Your Elon To Work Day&quot;! <a href="https://t.co/vIQmi6Smgc">pic.twitter.com/vIQmi6Smgc</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1889872129543290883?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2025</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>And on the Daily Show, Jordan Klepper recapped an Oval Office presser hosted by Trump and Musk. “It’s good that we have Elon Musk here,” said Klepper, “because we’ve been watching him slashing programs and shuttering agencies for a month now, and we can finally ask Elon, ‘Why are you doing this?’”</p> <p>Musk defended his unofficial “department of government efficiency” (also known as Doge) because: “It’s incredibly important that the president, the House and the Senate decide what happens, as opposed to a large, unelected bureaucracy.”</p> <p>Though Musk disparaged unelected bureaucrats, Klepper had to ask: “Isn’t that you …? Am I going crazy? Because it feels like I’m watching Drake sing Not Like Us at karaoke. Like, does he not know?</p> <p>“Is having this one unaccountable bureaucrat in charge better than having those other unaccountable bureaucrats in charge?” he continued. “Because at least the others have to follow transparency laws. The only thing transparent about Doge is Elon’s skin.”</p> <p>As Klepper noted, Musk’s financial disclosures are being kept secret, the ‘efficiency’ agency is exempt from open records laws, and when someone on X posted the names of Doge employees, the account was suspended and Musk tweeted “you have committed a crime” – “which, we tried to factcheck with career officials at the FBI, but they’re all working at a Panera now”, Klepper quipped.</p> <p>Musk also defended himself against obvious conflicts of interest, saying: “I fully expect to be scrutinized and get a daily proctology exam.”</p> <p>“Well, I did the exam, and what an asshole,” Klepper retorted.</p> <p><em><strong>Send us a tip</strong><br>If you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of cuts to federal programs, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (646) 886-8761. </em></p>
