<p>Diwali – the festival of lights – is marked in so many interesting ways. There’s a five-day celebration (beginning this year on Saturday 18 October) observed by Hindus, Jains and Sikhs across the world, where homes are decorated, candles are lit and families gather to root the year ahead in hope, accompanied by feasts and fun. </p> <p>Another vital part of Diwali celebrations is gift-giving, a way of saying I wish you prosperity and joy for the year ahead. Usually, those gifts are new clothes or mithai – boxes of south Asian sweets. Increasingly, though, gifts are being chosen with more intention to honour the individual, while also wishing them well.</p> <p>That doesn’t mean shopping for Diwali gifts has to be hard, time consuming or expensive. There are now options to suit every Diwali gift budget and taste. I’m a beauty and lifestyle journalist with a love for shopping and finding pieces that honour our heritage, support south Asian-owned businesses, and simply bring a little comfort and joy into daily life. Below, you’ll find something thoughtful for everyone in your life this Diwali.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>My favourite Diwali gifts for 2025</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2>For the beauty and grooming obsessed</h2>    <p><strong>Ranavat Royal Trio bestsellers set</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.spacenk.com/uk/skincare/treatment/serums/royal-trio-bestsellers-set-UK200058693.html" > £55 at Space NK </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/ranavat-royal-trio-best-sellers" > £55 at Sephora </a>  <p>Fusing ancient Ayurvedic wisdom with her background in pharmaceuticals, Michelle Ranavat’s beauty brand honours her Indian heritage.
