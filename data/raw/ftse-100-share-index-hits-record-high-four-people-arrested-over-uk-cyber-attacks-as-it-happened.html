It had managed to briefly scale that peak a year earlier but quickly fell back, so watching the FTSE 100 creep closer and closer to 9,000 feels a little surreal,” says <strong>AJ Bell</strong> head of financial analysis<strong> Danni Hewson</strong>.</p> <p>She adds:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“London based mining stocks have surged today, helping to bolster an index which has been on the front foot for most of the year, if you excuse its post Liberation Day rout. Investors have had a chance to digest Donald Trump’s copper tariffs and the surge in prices has certainly created opportunities, at least in the short term.</p> <p>“It’s going to take years for the US to increase its copper mining and smelting capacity, and considering how vital it is in manufacturing EVs and mobile phones, not to mention its importance in the power grid, US demand is unlikely to fall back in any measurable way. That means copper importers are stuck between a rock and a hard place, and it will be the US consumer who will ultimately pay the price.</p> <p>“But the current price surge reflects shifting policy. The sector had been anticipating tariffs on copper – even if they have come in much higher than expected – and stockpiles have been built up, so the price premium is expected to fall back in the near term.</p> <p>“What is unknown is where prices will settle once they’ve had a bit of time to bed in, and how that will affect global trade, especially if economic growth slows across the world as it’s predicted to because of all the uncertainty.</p> <p>“Generally, investors seem to have been rather dismissive of Donald Trump’s latest tariff tangos, believing that ultimately the US president will back off if negotiations don’t go his way. The crunch point is likely to be if a US-EU deal can’t get over the line, but even then the assumption seems to be that the new deadline, just like the last, is soft.”</p> </blockquote> <p>And on that note, goodnight! <strong>GW</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686fd86c8f08225fdca8864e" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-10T15:15:27.068Z">4.15pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">JPMorgan CEO Dimon warns of complacency in financial markets</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that markets are complacent, in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements, </strong><em><strong>Reuters reports</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Dimon</strong> told an event at Ireland’s foreign ministry:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Unfortunately I think there is complacency in markets”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686fd5838f08a1ce6226f8c9" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-10T15:01:48.290Z">4.01pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Although shares in London have had a strong day, the pound has been weakening.</p> <p>Sterling has slipped by a third of a cent today to $1.355, with the US dollar strengthening a little following the drop in jobless claims reported today.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686fc4ef8f08582ef190b15b" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/sarahbutler"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-10T13:50:54.980Z">2.50pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Mulberry raises £20m to fund growth drive</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Back in the UK, Mulberry has raised £20m from its key shareholders, Challice and Frasers Group, to boost growth amid falling sales and widening losses at the British luxury handbag maker.</strong></p> <p>The group said it would also raise up to £1.2m from other shareholders after it revealed sales fell 21% to £120.4m in the year to the end of March while underlying losses widened to almost £24m from just under £23m a year before.</p> <p>It said the new funds would enable it to make “targeted investments to accelerate its future growth and meet its stated medium term financial targets.”</p> <p>The latest fundraising comes less than a year after Mulberry raise £10.35m, before expenses to strengthen its balance sheet and provide “financial flexibility” amid a slowdown in the global luxury market.</p> <p>The group also slashed a quarter of staff at its headquarters in Somerset late last year after rejecting an £111m bid from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/frasers-group">Frasers</a>, Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley’s retail business.</p> <p>Challice, a group controlled by the Singaporean entrepreneur Christina Ong and her husband, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/oct/13/mulbery-owner-rejects-increased-bid-from-mike-ashley-frasers-group">was quick to rebuff the proposal</a>, saying it had no interest in selling its shares.

This demonstrates the impact of higher interest rates and slower economic growth on companies’ ability to service their debt.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Germany continues to be the most distressed market, at 11.5%, the highest level since the pandemic. The country has experienced minimal growth in recent years and is more exposed to struggling sectors like the automotive and chemicals industries.

Healthcare stocks are also strong across Europe. This may sound counterintuitive, President Trump has just announced tariffs on copper, and is threatening a 200% levy on pharma imports, so why are these sectors rallying?</p> <p>The reason is that there has been very little concrete details about how tariffs will be applied, which is why we are seeing these sectors steal the spotlight: investors expect Trump to back-track.

We see eventual tariffs ending between 10-15% on average. While a negative from a macro perspective, the world can live with 10-15% tariffs.</p> <p>We also remain of the view that tariff revenue will be used to justify the extension of tax cuts.

But the number of letters sent each year has more than halved over that time.</p> <p><strong>Natalie Black</strong>, <strong>Ofcom’s</strong> Group Director for Networks and Communications, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“These changes are in the best interests of consumers and businesses, as urgent reform of the postal service is necessary to give it the best chance of survival.</p> <p>“But changing Royal Mail’s obligations alone won’t guarantee a better service – the company now has to play its part and implement this effectively.
