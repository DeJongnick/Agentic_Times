This means the private sector is still expanding, but at a slower row, after a three-month high in March.</p> <p>Growth with the services sector slowed sharply to only a modest pace, registering the second-weakest expansion recorded over the past year, in response to slower order book growth. Firms flagged uncertainty surrounding the economy and tariffs. </p> <p>Demand growth was subdued in particular by a fall in exports of services (which include tourism-related activities as well as cross-border activities by service providers) on a scale not seen since January 2023.</p> <p>Manufacturing output meanwhile edged back into growth after slipping into decline in March, though the expansion was only marginal. Whilst new orders placed at factories rose at a slightly faster rate, linked to higher domestic orders, the increase was only modest and curbed by a marked fall in export orders. </p> <p>While tariffs had in some instances reportedly helped drive new sales to domestic customers, trade policy was widely linked to falling foreign sales.</p> <p>Sentiment among companies about their output over the coming year fell for a third successive month, dropping sharply to register the least optimistic outlook since July 2022. The latest reading was the joint-second lowest since September 2020, surpassed only by October 2022.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6808f4748f0891a8217d00ce" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-23T14:11:30.457Z">3.11pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Wall Street joins global stock market rally</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>US stocks have jumped on Wall Street, joining a global stock market rally, after president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> reassured investors by saying he had no plans to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, hinted at lower tariffs for China.<br><br>The S&amp;P 500 was 2.9% higher in early trading, following yesterday’s 2.5% gain that came after heavy losses on Monday.

Will they really save you money? We’re generally the cheapest or near enough: in fact, nine out of 10 Octopus customers pay less than they could with any other large supplier on the same product.”</p> <p>British Gas complained that only consumers currently on a standard variable tariff (SVT) with another supplier would save money.</p> <p>Octopus said the ads were intended to highlight the potential savings that a significant majority of consumers currently on standard tariffs could achieve if they switched to the supplier.</p> <p>It told the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that it did not claim that Octopus was the cheapest supplier in every scenario or for every tariff type, adding that it would be willing to make changes to its advertising.</p> <p>The ASA said consumers would understand from the claims that energy bills would be cheaper for most households if they were to switch to Octopus from any other provider.<br>The regulator understood that 80% of gas customers and 71% of electricity customers with other providers were on their supplier’s default SVT.</p> <p>It noted that Ofgem data from June 2024, based on average annual tariffs in the preceding quarter, showed that Octopus had the cheapest SVT of the seven major suppliers, saying: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We considered that those customers who switched from a non-Octopus SVT to an Octopus SVT were therefore likely to achieve a saving.</p> <p>Because those potential customers constituted the majority of UK households, we considered that most homes could or would potentially save money.</p> </blockquote>    <p>However, the watchdog understood that consumers who were on a fixed tariff with another supplier might not necessarily save if they switched to Octopus, while Octopus customers on an SVT seeking to move onto a fixed tariff might get a greater saving if they switched to another supplier.</p> <p>The ASA said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Because the ads did not make clear that the claims that most homes ‘could’ or ‘would’ save applied only to consumers on non-Octopus SVTs who chose to switch to an Octopus SVT, we considered they were likely to mislead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Regarding the claim that Octopus was “generally the cheapest or near enough”, the ASA found that other types of tariff, such as fixed rate tariffs, could be cheaper with another large supplier, ruling: “Because the ad did not make clear the basis of the claim, we considered that it was misleading.”</p> <p>The watchdog explained: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Octopus Energy to ensure that they included adequate substantiation to support claims, including comparisons with identifiable competitors, in their marketing materials and to make the basis of any claim clear in their advertising. We also told them to ensure that any comparative claims were verifiable.</p> </blockquote> <p>An Octopus Energy spokesman said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The ASA confirmed the headline in our advert - that most homes could save with Octopus - but asked for a little bit more clarification in the small print, which we were delighted to add.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6808e1768f08ec68f1a2b2ee" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-23T13:11:57.942Z">2.11pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">AstraZeneca boss joins other pharma CEOs in calling for higher drug spending in Europe</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> boss <strong>Pascal Soriot</strong> has added his voice to other European pharmaceutical bosses calling for higher spending on medicines in Europe.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The world order is shifting right now and Europe needs to invest more in what really matters to it. Europe has stepped up to invest more in defence and now it must protect its health sovereignty.</p> <p>Europe spends a substantially lower share of GDP on innovative medicines than the US and, as a result, is falling behind in attracting R&amp;D and manufacturing investments, putting its ability to protect the health of its own people at risk.</p> </blockquote> <p>The chief executives of Swiss drugmaker <strong>Novartis</strong> and France’s <strong>Sanofi</strong> have called on the EU to increase drug prices to bring them more into line with those paid by the US, arguing it will encourage innovation –- i.e. the development of new treatments.</p> <p>Several major European pharma companies have announced total investments of more than $150bn in the US in recent weeks, at least in part intended to head off potentially punitive <strong>Donald <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs">Trump</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs"> tariffs</a>.

Launch prices are suppressed, patented medicines’ growth capped, and prices reduced when new applications are found. The US and China are finding ways to incentivise innovation, while Europe is penalising it.</p> </blockquote> <p>The US pays nearly three times as much for branded and generic medicines as other comparable countries, according to US government estimates.</p> <p>The EU should create a Europe-wide list price for medicines “within range of US net prices”, the pharma bosses say, adding that this could be adjusted though rebates for some countries. Secondly, they argue that the EU should also set a Europe-wide spend target for innovative medicines and vaccines.</p> <p>The letter points to data that 30% of medicines approved in the US are still not available in Europe after two years. Narasimhan and Hudson add:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Over time it is inevitable that clinical trials and R&amp;D [research &amp; development] will further shift to the US and China.</p> </blockquote> <p>The letter comes after <a href="https://www.efpia.eu/news-events/the-efpia-view/statements-press-releases/pharma-ceos-alert-president-von-der-leyen-to-risk-of-exodus-to-the-us/">pharma bosses wrote to European commission president </a><strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> earlier this month to warn that “unless Europe delivers rapid, radical policy change then pharmaceutical research, development and manufacturing is increasingly likely to be directed towards the US”.</p>    <p>The EU’s average government spending on health in 2022 was 7.7% of GDP.

Looking a few weeks ahead, our preference is for a stabilisation in the dollar rather than another structural weakening.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-680882198f0887d718c2e495" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-23T06:38:44.673Z">7.38am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Introduction: UK annual borrowing nearly £15bn above official forecast; stocks rise as Trump rows back on Fed attack</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy.</strong></p> <p>Government borrowing in the UK rose more than expected last month, which means the government borrowed nearly £15bn more than forecast over the year than in the previous fiscal year, underlining the challenges the chancellor <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> faces.</p> <p>Borrowing – the difference between total public sector spending and income – was £16.4bn in March; this was £2.8bn higher than in March 2024, and the third-highest March borrowing since monthly records began in 1993.</p> <p>This means the government borrowed £151.9bn in the fiscal year to March – £20.7bn more than in the previous year, and £14.6bn more than the £137.3bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the arbiter of the public finances.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/ONS/status/1914922302707245292">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks was £151.9 billion (or 5.3% of GDP) in the 2024 to 2025 financial year,<br><br>£20.7 billion (or 0.5 percentage points) more than in the previous year and the third highest total on record.<br><br>Read more ➡️ <a href="https://t.co/OKGJdDm02v">https://t.co/OKGJdDm02v</a> <a href="https://t.co/obTVjjOX9x">pic.twitter.com/obTVjjOX9x</a></p>&mdash; Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) <a href="https://twitter.com/ONS/status/1914922302707245292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 23, 2025</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p><strong>Nabil Taleb</strong>, economist at PwC UK, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Debt interest payments reached £4.3bn in March, the highest March figure since monthly records began 27 years ago. This reflects the fiscal challenge the chancellor faces. Higher debt servicing costs as a share of total revenues will leave the public finances more exposed to future economic shocks.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves continues to hold the fiscal line, but the next six months will be critical—and she needs some clear wins. While her spring statement restored the £9.9bn headroom, that cushion remains precarious. In the worst-case scenario outlined by the government’s independent forecaster, Trump’s new tariffs could alone shave 1% off UK GDP—enough to wipe out the headroom entirely. The rising cost of government borrowing and growing global uncertainty are compounding the pressure for Reeves to put tax rises on the table during the autumn budget.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stocks and the dollar bounced back and oil prices rose, as <strong>Donald Trump</strong> rowed back on his attacks on America’s top central banker, whom he called a “major loser” on Monday for not cutting interest rates.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/22/trump-jerome-powell-fed">The US president said he had no plans to fire Federal Reserve chair </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/22/trump-jerome-powell-fed">Jerome Powell</a></strong>, and hints at lower tariffs for China, also from the US treasury secretary, cheered investors. <strong>Scott Bessent</strong> said the current tariff situation is “unsustainable” and expects a de-escalation in the near term.</p> <p>Trump said during a White House news conference that high tariffs on goods from China will “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/22/trump-china-tariffs">Trump says China tariffs will drop ‘substantially – but it won’t be zero’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Wall Street yesterday, Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 large US companies, the broader S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq all <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/22/gold-hits-3500-us-dollar-sinks-three-year-low-stock-markets">ended the day up more than 2.5%</a> following Monday’s sell-off.</p> <p>In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei rose by nearly 2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 2.2% and the South Korean Kospi gained 1.6%.</p> <p>The dollar, which hit a three-year low yesterday before recovering, rose by 0.25% against a basket of major currencies.</p> <p>ING currency analyst <strong>Francesco Pesole </strong>said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The dollar is enjoying some support thanks to a recovery in US market sentiment.
