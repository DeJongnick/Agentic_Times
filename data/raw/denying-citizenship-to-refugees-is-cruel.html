<p>It was good to see the Labour peer David Blunkett questioning recent <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-character-nationality-policy-guidance/good-character-requirement-accessible">Home Office guidance</a> that states that people who have “made a dangerous journey will normally be refused citizenship” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/16/starmer-union-ally-joins-opposition-to-rules-barring-citizenship-for-small-boat-refugees">Starmer union ally joins opposition to rules barring citizenship for small boat refugees, 16 February</a>).</p> <p>When he was home secretary, Blunkett introduced citizenship ceremonies as a means of giving more significance to the acquisition of citizenship and strengthening social cohesion.</p> <p>I was the speaker at Hackney council, east London, in 2016-17 and presided over many citizenship ceremonies. These were deeply moving occasions. For many, becoming a citizen was&nbsp;the&nbsp;end of a long and often difficult struggle. It was hugely important, allowing them finally to feel secure and that&nbsp;this is truly&nbsp;their home.</p> <p>As a volunteer at Hackney Migrant Centre, I meet many people who have made dangerous journeys to the UK. One, a public servant from Iran, refused to take part in repressive action against a demonstration during the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/18/women-forced-out-of-iran-acts-of-resistance-hope">Women, life, freedom</a>” struggle in 2022. That brave decision meant he had to flee for his life, arriving in this country without papers. This cruel new guidance means that he will never really be able to feel settled here.<br><strong>Rosemary Sales</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
