<p>Bogus websites are promising compensation payouts worth thousands of pounds to women who had their state pension age delayed by the government.</p> <p>Campaigners from the group Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) have warned that fraudulent sites are claiming a compensation scheme has been announced by the government, and that some are asking for personal details to process claims.</p> <p>The fake sites are appearing in internet searches for the terms “Waspi” or “Waspi compensation”, or in links in emails that urge women to sign up.</p> <p>Some are using the name of the money-saving expert Martin Lewis to try to make their claims look legitimate. This week he warned that “compensation over the change in state pension age” seemed to be a new trend among scammers, and said he never allowed his name to be used for endorsements.</p> <p>None of them can offer compensation because the government has refused to make any payouts.</p> <h2>What the scam looks like</h2> <p>A website suggesting you can get compensation for being one of the Waspi women.</p> <p>The websites typically say you can claim for a payout worth several thousand pounds. They often mention the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/mar/21/thousands-of-uk-women-owed-pension-payout-after-ombudsmans-waspi-ruling">£2,950 figure</a> that was the highest payout recommended last year by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO).</p> <p>Some of the sites have calculators claiming to show how much you could be owed in compensation. These suggest figures far in excess of those recommended by the PHSO.</p> <h2>What the fake sites asks for</h2> <p>One Waspi woman has reported being asked for her birth certificate and bank details.</p> <p>Some sites appear to be trying to push people to sign up for other compensation schemes, including those for car finance (again, there is no official scheme currently).</p> <h2>What to do</h2> <p>Ignore anything claiming a compensation scheme exists – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/dec/17/anger-greets-uk-government-decision-not-to-compensate-waspi-women">the government has rejected</a> calls for payouts. Even though the case has been in the news again this year, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/feb/24/waspi-campaigners-threaten-government-legal-action-compensation">the Waspi group threatening legal action</a>, that position has not changed.</p> <p>If it does, the compensation would be administered by the government. The official <a href="https://www.waspi.co.uk/">Waspi campaign group website</a> is a good place to check for the latest news on this.</p> <p>If you have given away your bank details, call your bank.
