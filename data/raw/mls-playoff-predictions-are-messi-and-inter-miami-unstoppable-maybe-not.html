<h2>The regular season was defined by ...</h2> <p>If last season was defined by Lionel Messi, this one was about <strong>Inter Miami as a whole</strong>. The club built the plane as they were flying it, stretching the MLS rulebook to its absolute limit as it added players, shedded others, and ended the season with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/inter-miami-points-record-lionel-messi">best-ever points total in league history</a>. Big spending and sporting success haven’t usually gone hand-in-hand in MLS, but 2024 was the year that Miami showed that era is well and truly over. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>More <strong>fun, interesting teams</strong> than we’ve ever seen take the field in a single MLS season. In the league’s 29th campaign, four teams averaged at least 1.87 points per game (which translates to at least a 64-point pace across the existing 34-game schedule) for the first time. Hats off to Miami, Columbus, LAFC, and the Galaxy. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p><strong>Inter Miami chasing – and achieving – history. </strong>Even when Messi wasn’t there over the summer, it was about whether Tata Martino could keep his team on track for the Supporters’ Shield. That Inter Miami were able to maintain consistent form over the full season says a lot about their impressive squad-building. It’s not all about Messi, as it turns out. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Best team that didn’t make the playoffs ...</h2> <p>It’s pretty clear that the <strong>Philadelphia Union</strong> are a much better team than they showed this year. They still have a lot of talent, a productive academy system, and most of the key figures that made them a 2022 MLS Cup finalist and consistent threat for the last several years. The defending was too haphazard in 2024 though, resulting in a lot of lost leads – a league-worst 27 points dropped from winning positions. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>You have to be pretty darn bad – or pretty darn unlucky – to miss the playoffs in a league where 62% of teams make the postseason. The <strong>Philadelphia Union</strong>, who finished with the eighth-best xG differential in the league according to FBref, probably fall into that latter category. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p>2024 could have been very different for <strong>FC Dallas</strong> had they been able to get their best players on the pitch more often. Injuries hit the Texans hard. Two (Alan Velasco and Jesus Ferreira) of their three Designated Players played under 1,400 minutes over the campaign. Even Petar Musa, who scored 16 goals, was bitten by a Frisco injury bug that compromised Dallas’s season. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Your dark horses are ...</h2> <p><strong>In the West: Vancouver.</strong> Wednesday’s 5-0 thrashing of Portland in the wildcard game will have them flying high, and in Ryan Gauld they have a special player who can turn the fortunes of just about any game. <strong>In the East: Charlotte FC.</strong> Kristijan Kahlina has put in several match-winning performances this year, and there’s no reason to think he isn’t capable of something similar in the playoffs. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>Though the playoff field is more top-heavy than ever, I’m not prepared to bet against the <strong>Seattle Sounders</strong>. They have the league’s best defense based on goals and xG allowed, not to mention postseason experience. Minnesota United could surprise, too, given that the top of the West looks more vulnerable than the top of the East. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p><strong>Minnesota United</strong>. The sixth seeds in the Western Conference have performed admirably this season considering Eric Ramsay’s late arrival, and the Loons might have timed their run for the playoffs perfectly, winning four of their final five regular-season games. If Kelvin Yeboah can stay hot, Minnesota could go far. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Big team at risk of going out early ...</h2> <p><strong>LA Galaxy.</strong> Greg Vanney’s side have been great fun to watch, but they boast the worst defensive record of all playoff qualifiers. Their opponents Colorado have lost four straight heading into the playoffs, but then so had Vancouver before dominating Portland. Djordje Mihailovic is adept at picking apart defenses, and the Galaxy’s could be next in line. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>Both No 3 seeds – FC Cincinnati and Real Salt Lake – could go out in the first round. But if I’m going really big? A first round or conference semifinal meltdown is absolutely not beneath the <strong>LA Galaxy</strong>. They’re an elite attacking team, but one with huge defensive flaws. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p><strong>FC Cincinnati.</strong> Pat Noonan’s team may struggle to live up to their billing as third seeds in the East. Injuries have depleted Cincy, with Aaron Boupendza’s contract termination leaving them short of a match-winning No 9. Problems at both ends of the pitch makes FC Cincinnati vulnerable against New York City FC in round one. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Player to watch ...</h2> <p>It’s Messi. Sorry. But if you’re looking for a slightly more under-the-radar selection than the most famous and best player to ever kick a ball, may I suggest Real Salt Lake’s <strong>Diego Luna</strong>. The US youth international’s energetic style and flair for the dramatic puts him right at home in a side that is always keen on making any game a battle. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>Messi, of course, is the right answer. But let’s give <strong>Cucho Hernández</strong> some love, shall we? The 25-year-old Columbus Crew star is part striker, part winger, part attacking midfielder, and all fun. He’s worked his way into the Colombian national team and is the one who makes Wilfried Nancy’s system sing. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p><strong>Gabriel Pec</strong> could be the key to the LA Galaxy making a deep run. The Brazilian is in exceptional form, having scored in each of his last five games. If he can keep that up, the Cup could be on its way to Carson again. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Eastern Conference final ...</h2> <p>Inter Miami over Columbus Crew. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>Inter Miami over Columbus Crew. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p>Columbus Crew over Inter Miami. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>Western Conference final ...</h2> <p>Real Salt Lake over Seattle Sounders. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>LAFC over LA Galaxy. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p>LAFC over LA Galaxy. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>MLS Cup final ...</h2> <p><strong>Inter Miami over Real Salt Lake.</strong> Real Salt Lake have a chance to fulfill their role as MLS’s eternal dark horse, and they’ll show enough fight to make the game a classic. But we all know how this is going to end. In a one-off format, in a final, I don’t think there’s any point in doubting what Messi, Luis Suárez, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, and all of their teammates can do. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p><strong>Inter Miami over LAFC.</strong> I’m not bold (or foolish?) enough to pick against an Inter Miami team with the greatest player ever fresh off setting the single-season points record. We’ve never seen anything like 2024 Inter Miami in MLS, and neither have opposing defenses by the looks of it. They’ll have more than enough juice to lift MLS Cup. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p><strong>Columbus Crew over LAFC.</strong> After Messi Mania and referee lockouts and US Open Cup controversy and everything else in between, a rematch of last year’s MLS Cup final could be on the cards. Inter Miami have Messi, but Columbus have Wilfried Nancy and not only do the Crew play the most exciting brand of soccer in MLS, they know how to win knockout matches. <strong>GR</strong></p>
