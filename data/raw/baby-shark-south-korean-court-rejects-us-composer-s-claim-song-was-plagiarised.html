<p>South Korea’s supreme court has rejected a US composer’s allegation that the producers of the catchy children’s song Baby Shark plagiarised his work, ending a six-year-long legal battle.</p> <p>The court upheld two lower court verdicts in favour of Pinkfong, the South Korean company behind the tune with the famous “doo doo doo doo doo doo” refrain.</p> <p>The Pinkfong song, released in 2016, has been phenomenally successful: it has spawned spinoff TV shows, movies and smartphone apps, making the company millions. Today, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w">Baby Shark Dance video</a> is the most viewed on YouTube, with more than 16bn views, roughly double those of the runner-up, Despacito by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee, and third-placed Wheels on the Bus by the children’s YouTube channel Cocomelon.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XqZsoesa55w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Baby Shark Dance by Pinkfong (2016)</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 2019, the children’s songwriter Jonathan Wright – known as Johnny Only – filed a lawsuit in Seoul, claiming Pinkfong copied his earlier version of the original song, which is thought to have been around for more than five decades.</p> <p>On Thursday, the court ruled that Wright’s version “had not reached a level of substantial alteration” from the original for it to be considered a separate work, which means it is not protected as a separate piece of work under copyright law.</p> <p>Wright uploaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkHdx0yWaow">his version</a>, which also includes the “doo doo doo doo doo doo” line, to his YouTube channel in 2011. The video features him and children doing a simple hand motion, resembling a shark’s mouth, to a bouncy beat.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkHdx0yWaow"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hkHdx0yWaow?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Baby Shark Song (Non-dismemberment version) by Johnny Only (2011)</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 2015 and 2016, Pinkfong uploaded its versions with cartoon sharks singing in Korean, and later released it in English with children doing choreographed dances, including the shark’s mouth hand gesture.</p> <p>The South Korean company argued that its version was an arrangement of the same song, which it argued was in the public domain.</p> <p>The song is thought to have originated in the US in the 1970s and been popularised at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-UUFaESMU">summer camps</a>, with darker lyrics that ended with <a href="https://campsongs.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/baby-shark/">the shark killing the singer</a>. Some theories suggest it was created in 1975, around the time Steven Spielberg’s film Jaws became a global box office hit.</p> <p>Other versions of Baby Shark predate Wright’s video, including the French <a href="https://youtu.be/HTL1fumzMdY?si=J49eVbvtVuEhAuHZ">Bébé Requin</a> and the German <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSB9LIXEtTw">Kleiner Hai (Little Shark)</a>, which became a viral hit in Europe in 2007.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSB9LIXEtTw"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xSB9LIXEtTw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Kleiner Hai by Alemuel (2008)</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But none of them had the success of Pinkfong’s adaptation, which sparked viral social media moments such as the #BabySharkChallenge and reached No 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p> <p>Wright said he initially thought that “[Pinkfong] could go right ahead and use it” because the song was in the public domain.</p> <p>But he decided to pursue a copyright suit when he learned that Pinkfong itself had threatened legal action against a South Korean political party, the opposition People Power, who had used Baby Shark in a political campaign.</p> <p>“The wheels in my head start turning … Doesn’t that mean that my version also has copyright protection?” Wright told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2019.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2018/sep/03/baby-shark-short-guide-most-annoying-song">Scared of Baby Shark? A short guide to the year’s most annoying song</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wright said Pinkfong’s version seemed “strikingly similar” to his, highlighting that the two songs had “same key, same tempo change, same melody and rhythm”. He demanded 30m won ($22,000/£16,000) in compensation.</p> <p>The supreme court focused on whether Wright’s version could be considered a “secondary work” of the original children’s song, and whether Pinkfong had made its version based on his work.</p> <p>It concluded that Wright did not make “edits or changes to a level” that could grant him a copyright as a secondary work. Even with the assumption that his version was a secondary work of the song, the court said that there were “no substantial similarities” between Pinkfong’s song and Wright’s version.</p> <p>“All appeals were dismissed and the lower court’s rulings were upheld,” according to court documents seen by AFP.</p> <p>The Pinkfong Company said in a statement on Thursday that the supreme court’s decision confirmed Baby Shark was “based on a traditional singalong chant that has entered the public domain”.</p> <p>The company said it had given “a fresh twist to the chant by adding an upbeat rhythm and catchy melody, turning it into the pop culture icon it is today”.</p>
