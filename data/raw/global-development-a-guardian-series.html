<p>This content is supported, in part, through philanthropic funding to <a href="https://theguardian.org/">theguardian.org</a>, a US-based foundation that partners with the Guardian on independent editorial projects. Support for the global development project comes to theguardian.org from the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.</p> <p>All of the journalism is editorially independent, commissioned and produced by our Guardian journalists. You can read more about content funding on the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/25/content-funding">here</a>.</p> <p>All our journalism follows GNM’s published <a href="https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2023/07/27/GNM_editorial_code_of_practice_and_guidance_2023.pdf">editorial code</a>. The Guardian is committed to open journalism, recognising that the best understanding of the world is achieved when we collaborate, share knowledge, encourage debate, welcome challenge, and harness the expertise of specialists and their communities.</p> <p>The Guardian’s <a href="http://oneworldmedia.org.uk/awards/winners">award-winning</a> global development site was launched in 2010 to provide special focus on the <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/index.shtml">millennium development goals</a> — the eight targets set in 2000 by the United Nations Millennium Declaration with the aim of improving the lives of the world’s poorest people by 2015. The site has gone on to produce news, features, debate, multi-media and photography from journalists, experts and people around the world.</p> <p>The only restriction to the Guardian’s coverage is where charitable foundations are prohibited under US law from directly funding or earmarking funds to: (a) conduct lobbying or otherwise attempt to influence legislation; (b) influence the outcome of any specific public election or carry on any voter registration drive; or (c) to undertake activity for any purpose other than charitable, scientific, or educational, within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 170(c)(2)(B). This means any communications to the public in which a view is expressed about a specific legislative proposal, and the recipients of the communications are urged through a “call to action” to contact government officials, must provide a reasoned, objective consideration of facts and issues in a full and fair manner that enables third parties to develop their own positions on any legislation that may be discussed.</p> <p>Unless otherwise stated, all statements and materials, including any statements regarding specific legislation, reflect the views of the individual contributors and not those of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, <a href="https://theguardian.org/">theguardian.org</a>, or the Guardian.</p> <p>• This page was updated on 22 May 2024 to reflect current information and replaced an earlier version published in 2011.</p>
