<p>The entrance into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia">Georgia</a> governor’s race of two prominent figures on the right who stood up to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s effort to steal the 2020 election shows how the election interference crisis continues to reverberate in the state’s politics.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, announced his candidacy. Raffensperger was the recipient of the “perfect phone call” by Trump in 2020 in the wake of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/dec/08/us-election-results-2020-joe-biden-defeats-donald-trump-to-win-presidency">his electoral loss</a> in Georgia, pressuring Raffensperger to “find 11,780 votes” and overturn the results.</p> <p>The recording of that phone call led to investigations in Georgia and Washington. Raffensperger’s rejection of stolen election claims and his unwillingness to subvert Georgia election law for partisan purposes landed him near the top of Trump’s enemies list.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/election-deniers-midterms-board-offices">Election deniers now hold posts on local US election boards, raising concerns for midterms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a rally in Atlanta during the campaign, Trump <a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/campaign-2024/donald-trump-criticizes-gas-gov-kemp-and-sec-of-state-raffensperger/5127093">called</a> Raffensperger and the outgoing Republican governor, Brian Kemp, “disloyal” and said “they’re doing everything possible to make 2024 difficult for Republicans to win”. Kemp is term-limited and cannot run again in 2026.</p> <p>In his announcement address, Raffensperger said: “I’m a conservative Republican, and I’m prepared to make the tough decisions. I follow the law and the constitution, and I’ll always do the right thing for Georgia no matter what.”</p> <p>Raffensperger pledged to work toward capping seniors’ property taxes, banning puberty-blocking drugs from minors and eliminating the state income tax.</p> <p>And last Tuesday, former lieutenant governor and erstwhile Republican Geoff Duncan announced his candidacy for governor. Duncan was elected lieutenant governor in 2018 as a Republican, forgoing re-election in 2022 after drawing heated reaction from Trump supporters after repudiating stolen election claims. Duncan testified before the special purpose grand jury in Fulton county examining election-interference claims.</p> <p>Duncan published a book about reforming the Republican party in 2021, and briefly <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2024/03/19/former-georgia-lt-gov-geoff-duncan-will-not-run-no-labels-it-seeks-2024-candidate">considered</a> running for president under the No Labels brand as an independent in 2024. Presenting himself as a political iconoclast, Duncan announced last month that he had formally switched parties.</p> <p>In the absence of the election-interference case that followed Trump’s efforts in 2020, both Duncan and Raffensperger would have been considered orthodox conservative Republicans by Georgia political standards.</p> <p>But Georgia’s Republican party can no longer be described as orthodox, except in its loyalty to Trump. Delegates to the Georgia GOP convention in January overwhelmingly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-republicans-brad-raffensperger-0eb973f721d0bf97210e404b27d34239">voted</a> to bar Raffensperger from qualifying as a Republican candidate while they <a href="https://www.gagop.org/geoff-duncan-banished-from-georgia-republican-party">expelled</a> Duncan entirely, citing his appearance at the Democratic National Convention endorsing Kamala Harris in the presidential election.</p> <p>The move was largely symbolic; state law provides for no mechanism for a political party to bar a candidate. Nonetheless, the animus from the 2020 election persists.</p> <p>In <a href="https://x.com/JoshMcKoon/status/1819359936196809125">dueling</a> <a href="https://x.com/GeoffDuncanGA/status/1819380652879274031">open letters</a> last year, the Georgia GOP chair, Josh McKoon, described Duncan as “prostituting” himself to CNN as a Trump critic.</p> <p>“[Y]our desperate and ridiculous endorsements of Joe Biden and now Kamala Harris for president, coupled with your inexplicable opposition in 2022 to [Republican Senate candidates] Burt Jones and Herschel Walker, not to mention your comical attempt to run for president as an independent candidate, are violations of the oaths of loyalty you repeatedly swore when you qualified as a Republican candidate for office,” McKoon wrote.</p> <p>Duncan legislated as a “100% pro-life” lawmaker, and supported a 2019 state law banning most abortions – a position he is now repudiating as a Democratic candidate, along with prior positions on gun control and Medicaid expansion. His argument to voters is that cross-party appeal is necessary to beat a Republican in the general election.</p> <p>“I’ve never wavered on taking on Trump,” Duncan said in his announcement video. “I’m running for governor to put Georgians in the best position to once again love their neighbors and to make Georgia the frontline of democracy and a backstop against extremism.”</p> <p>Duncan enters a Democratic race that grows increasingly crowded. He faces the state senator Jason Esteves, an Atlanta-area legislator and former Atlanta school board chairperson, as well as former labor commissioner and DeKalb county CEO Michael Thurmond and former Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Other candidates are expected to announce their bids in coming weeks.</p> <p>Among Republicans, Georgia’s attorney general, Chris Carr, and lieutenant governor, Burt Jones, have already declared their candidacies for governor. Carr stepped down from chairing the Republican Attorneys General Association after learning it had paid for a robocall urging supporters to come to Washington DC and “stop the steal” on 6 January 2021. Carr and Kemp are political allies.</p> <p>Jones is favored by Trump and was a mainstay on the 2024 campaign trail.</p> <p>“Chris Carr and Brad Raffensperger have one thing in common: They are both Never Trumpers,” Jones wrote on Instagram following Raffensperger’s announcement. “There is only one candidate in this race that’s always supported and has the full and complete endorsement of [Trump].”</p> <p>Jones, a Republican state senator in 2020, served as one of the 16 fake electors for Trump – all of whom signed a document, submitted to the National Archives, claiming Trump won Georgia.</p> <p>Fulton county’s district attorney, Fani Willis, had considered charging Jones in the election-interference case, but a Fulton county judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/13/burt-jones-georgia-lieutenant-governor-trump-election-case">barred</a> her in 2022 from investigating the lieutenant governor after she appeared at a fundraiser for Jones’s opponent. An outside prosecutor determined Jones’s actions as a state senator did not merit “further investigation or further actions” and considered the case closed.</p>
