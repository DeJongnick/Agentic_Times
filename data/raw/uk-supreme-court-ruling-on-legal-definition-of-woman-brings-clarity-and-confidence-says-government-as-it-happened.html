 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>This blog will be closing shortly. Here is a summary of the day’s developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/law/uk-supreme-court">UK supreme court</a> has ruled that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman and biological sex</strong>, in a victory for gender critical campaigners.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Five judges from the UK supreme court ruled unanimously</strong> <strong>that the legal definition of a woman in the <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/law/equality-act-2010">Equality Act 2010</a> did not include transgender women who hold gender recognition certificates (GRCs).</strong> In a significant defeat for the Scottish government, their decision will mean that transgender women can no longer sit on public boards in places set aside for women.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>It could have far wider ramifications by leading to much greater restrictions on the rights of transgender women to use services and spaces reserved for women</strong>, and spark calls for the UK’s laws on gender recognition to be rewritten.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Lord Hodge told the court the Equality Act (EA) was very clear that its provisions dealt with biological sex at birth, and not with a person’s acquired gender, regardless of whether they held a gender recognition certificate.</strong> That affected policy-making on gender in sports and the armed services, hospitals, as well as women-only charities, and access to changing rooms and women-only spaces, he said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Hodge urged people not to see the decision “as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another”</strong>. He said all transgender people had clear legal protections under the 2010 act against discrimination and harassment.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Gender critical campaign group For Women Scotland, which is backed financially by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/jkrowling">JK Rowling</a>, celebrated outside the supreme court in London</strong>, alongside other campaigners, after the ruling was announced. </p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A government spokesperson said on Wednesday that the supreme court ruling on the definition of a woman under the Equality Act bought “clarity and confidence, for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs”</strong>. The spokesperson said: “Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Maya Forstater, a gender critical activist who helped set up the campaign group Sex Matters, which took part in the supreme court case by supporting For Women <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland">Scotland</a>, said the decision was correct</strong>: “We are delighted that the supreme court has accepted the arguments of For <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/women">Women</a> Scotland and rejected the position of the Scottish government. The court has given us the right answer: the protected characteristic of sex – male and female – refers to reality, not to paperwork.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Kemi Badenoch described the supreme court ruling as a “victory”.</strong> The leader of the Conservative party said: “Saying ‘trans women are women’ was never true in fact, and now isn’t true in law either. This is a victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious. Women are women and men are men: you cannot change your biological sex.” <strong>The leader of the Scottish Tories called the supreme court decision a “victory for women across the United Kingdom”.</strong> Russell Findlay hailed the decision, which confirmed that the definition of woman in the 2010 Equality Act refers to biological women, as an “abject humiliation for the SNP”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trans rights campaigners urged trans people and their supporters to remain calm about the decision.</strong> The campaign group Scottish Trans <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scottishtrans.bsky.social/post/3lmwa44u2322g">said on social media</a> that they’d “urge people not to panic”, while LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall has said there was “deep concern at the widespread implications” of the court ruling, which it said is “incredibly worrying for the trans community”. Amnesty International UK ruling as “disappointing” with “potentially concerning consequences for trans people”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Scottish Greens described the supreme court ruling as “deeply concerning for human rights”.</strong> The party said it would “continue to stand with trans people and resist culture war being waged against them”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Kishwer Falkner, the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which had intervened in the case to support the Scottish government’s stance, said it would need time to fully interpret the ruling’s implications. However, <strong>the commission was pleased it had dealt with its concerns about the lack of clarity around single-sex and lesbian-only spaces.</strong> </p></li>

   <p>The outcome of today’s judgment is clearly disappointing. It is a long and complex judgment and we will take time to analyse its full implications. </p> 
   <p>There are potentially concerning consequences for trans people, but it is important to stress that the court has been clear that trans people are protected under the Equality Act against discrimination and harassment. </p> 
   <p>The ruling does not change the protection trans people are afforded under the protected characteristic of ‘gender reassignment’, as well as other provisions under the Equality Act. </p> 
   <p>Amnesty intervened in this case to remind the court that legal gender recognition is essential for trans people to enjoy the full spectrum of rights each of us is entitled to, including safety, health and family life.</p>

   <p>These protections were put in place in 2004 following a ruling by the European court of human rights, meaning today’s ruling undermines the vital human rights of my community to dignity, safety and the right to be respected for who we are.</p>

  <p>The prime minister and Scottish first minister must “make sure that the law is obeyed” after today’s <strong>supreme court</strong> ruling, a former Scottish MP has said. </p> 
  <p><strong>Joanna Cherry KC</strong>, the SNP’s former shadow home secretary who lost her seat in last year’s general election, said she feels “hugely vindicated” by the ruling but warned it needs to be implemented into everyday practice.</p> 
  <p>She told the PA news agency outside the court: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Now it’s over to the politicians to make sure that the law is obeyed. </p> 
   <p>I’m calling on my former colleague, John Swinney, the first minister of Scotland, and on the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, to respect this judgment and to do what they say that they do. </p> 
   <p>They both say they believe in women’s rights and they believe in women’s rights to single-sex spaces. If they mean that then they need to make sure that public policy changes to respect the fact that women means biological women and lesbian means women who are sexually attracted to women. </p> 
   <p>Men are not included within those categories.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Cherry said there will “have to be a sea change” across the public sector to recognise that the law has been clarified in the ruling. </p> 
  <p>Reflecting on her own experience, she said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’m a long-term feminist. I’m a lesbian who came out in the ‘80s and campaigned against section 28. </p> 
   <p>I’ve had to put up with my own party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, calling me a bigot and a transphobe for sticking up for the rights of women and lesbians. </p> 
   <p>I think she owes all of us, not just me, and more importantly the women of Scotland, an apology.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Policy Exchange</strong> thinktank described today’s <strong>supreme court</strong> judgment as a “welcome victory” but insisted it should have been the government rather than a court which clarified the issue. </p> 
  <p><strong>Lara Brown</strong>, senior research fellow on culture and identity at the thinktank, said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>By confirming that ‘sex’ in the Equality Act 2010 means ‘biological sex’, the supreme court has secured women’s sex-based rights – rights to which they have always been entitled as a matter of law. </p> 
   <p>While this is a welcome victory, it should never have been left to the courts to answer the question of ‘What is a woman?’ </p> 
   <p>Had the government used their statutory powers to clarify that sex in the Equality Act 2010 means biological sex, when Policy Exchange called for them to do so in 2023, the Scottish ministers would never have been able to issue unlawful advice on the subject.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The ruling by the <strong>supreme court</strong> that “woman” in the <strong>Equality Act (EA) 2010</strong> refers to biological women does not diminish transgender women’s protections against direct discrimination, the judges have said. </p> 
  <p>In their judgment, <strong>Lord Reed</strong>, <strong>Lord Hodge</strong>, <strong>Lady Rose</strong> and <strong>Lady Simler</strong> said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A man who identifies as a woman who is treated less favourably because of the protected characteristic of gender reassignment will be able to claim on that basis. </p> 
   <p>A man who identifies as a woman who is treated less favourably not because of being trans (the protected characteristic of gender reassignment) but because of being perceived as being a woman will be able to claim for direct sex discrimination on that basis. </p> 
   <p>This does not entail any practical disadvantage and there is no discordance (as the Scottish ministers appear to suggest) between the individual’s position in society and the ability to claim on this basis. </p> 
   <p>A certificated sex reading of the EA 2010 is not necessary here, and the approach applies equally whether or not the claimant has a gender recognition certificate.</p>

   <p>The ruling confirms that the words ‘gay’ and ‘lesbian’ refer to same-sex sexual orientation and makes it absolutely clear that lesbians wishing to form associations of any size are lawfully entitled to exclude men – whether or not they possess a GRC (gender recognition certificate).</p> 
   <p>It is difficult to express the significance of this ruling: it marks a watershed for women and, in particular, lesbians who have seen their rights and identities steadily stolen from them over the last decade.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is a victory for biology, for common sense, for reality. </p> 
   <p>It’s definitely a victory for lesbians as well, and it was specifically mentioned in the case how lesbians have been disadvantaged by this idea that maybe a man could be a woman and could be a lesbian if he had a certificate, and the ruling just absolutely blew that out of the water. </p> 
   <p>It was really fair, it was really clear and it delivers huge benefits to women and to lesbians in particular, so I’m absolutely we’re all thrilled about it.</p>

  <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> has lauded as a “victory” the supreme court ruling that “woman” in equality law refers to biological women. </p> 
  <p>According to the PA news agency, the Conservative party leader said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Saying ‘trans women are women’ was never true in fact, and now isn’t true in law either. </p> 
   <p>This is a victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious. Women are women and men are men: you cannot change your biological sex. </p> 
   <p>The era of Keir Starmer telling us women can have penises has come to an end. </p> 
   <p>Well done to For Women Scotland!</p>

   <p>We Conservatives, Claire Coutinho, (and) Kemi Badenoch had been pushing the government for many months to grip this situation and publish clear updated guidance. Now that we have legal clarity, ministers must do this without delay. </p> 
   <p>As minister for women and equalities, Kemi Badenoch started a call for evidence for examples of where bad guidance was misinterpreting the law – the government should use that work to make the guidance clear and certain so that the dignity, privacy and safety of women and girls is respected and crucially protected. </p>

   <p>References to a ‘woman’ and ‘women’ as a group sharing the protected characteristic of sex would include all females of any age, irrespective of any other protected characteristic, and those trans women, biological men, who have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment and a GRC, and who are therefore female as a matter of law. </p>

   <p>We can identify no good reason why the legislature should have intended that sex-based rights and protections under the EA 2010 should apply to these complex, heterogeneous groupings, rather than to the distinct group of, biological, women and girls, or men and boys, with their shared biology leading to shared disadvantage and discrimination faced by them as a distinct group.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Judges at the UK’s highest court have begun handing down their judgment on the legal definition of a woman.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>supreme court</strong> ruling follows a series of challenges brought by <strong>For Women Scotland (FWS)</strong> over the definition of “woman” in Scottish legislation mandating 50% female representation on public boards. </p> 
  <p>The dispute centres on whether or not somebody with a <strong>gender recognition certificate (GRC)</strong> recognising their gender as female should be treated as a woman under the <strong>2010 Equality Act</strong>.</p> 
  <p>You can listen to the judgment via the live stream at the top of this blog.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">How could the ruling change life for women and trans people in Scotland, England and Wales?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Equality Act</strong> already allows transgender women to be excluded from women-only groups and services, such as refuges, prisons or clubs – even those holding a <strong>gender recognition certificate (GRC)</strong> – if it is “a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim”. For example, <strong>Edinburgh Women’s Aid</strong> announced recently it would no longer let transgender women access its services.</p> 
  <p>But <strong>For Women Scotland (FWS)</strong> is concerned that, if it loses, using those exemptions would be made more complicated for women-only groups because a trans woman, deemed legally a woman, would therefore able to claim sex discrimination.</p> 
  <p><strong>Susan Smith</strong> of FWS said a victory “would put the protected status of sex beyond all doubt.</p> 
  <p>“A ruling in our favour would clear up any ambiguity about the provision of single-sex spaces and services under the Equality Act and enable providers to act with confidence.”</p> 
  <p>But trans-inclusive campaigners questioned this narrative of simple clarification, saying that if the <strong>supreme court</strong> allowed the appeal it would be going against 15 years of interpretation of the law, and would also undermine the premise of the <strong>Gender Recognition Act</strong>, which was to give legal recognition to an individual’s acquired gender.</p> 
  <p>Whatever the outcome, it will not change the law, of course, but in its aftermath there are likely to be further calls to revisit the Equality Act.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Equality and Human Rights Commission</strong>, the watchdog that enforces the 2010 act, argued for this in its own intervention in the case, suggesting MPs had not appreciated the consequences for women and lesbians of the law viewing a transgender woman with a GRC as legally female.</p> 
  <p>But <strong>Amnesty International</strong>, the only trans-inclusive organisation to intervene, raised concerns that this case could be the “thin end of the wedge” in undermining other rights.</p> 
  <p>If the legal sex of trans people with a GRC were reversed, it would result in trans people missing out on equal pay and sex discrimination rights, for example. In practice, it would affect a minority of trans people in the UK as only about 8,000 have applied for a GRC over the past 20 years.</p> 
  <p>More significant, suggest trans advocates, is the ruling’s contribution to a wider atmosphere of hostility, resulting in many trans people already self-excluding from public spaces.</p> 
  <p><strong>Steph Richards</strong>, who runs the advocacy organisation <strong>TransLucent</strong>, predicted that legal actions such as this one would “result in trans people going back to live in stealth”.</p>

  <p>Wednesday’s judgment concludes court action by <strong>For Women Scotland (FWS)</strong> over <strong>Holyrood</strong>’s <strong>Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018,</strong> which was aimed at improving gender balance.</p> 
  <p>An amendment to the SNP government’s bill, brought by a Scottish Labour MSP, expanded the scope of the legislation to include all trans women, whether or not they had applied for a GRC.</p> 
  <p>FWS launched a judicial review, arguing that Holyrood had gone beyond its competence by using such a wide definition of “woman” and the inner court of session in Edinburgh agreed.</p> 
  <p>Scottish ministers revised the statutory guidance, which stated the new law would follow the Equality Act by including transgender women who had a GRC within the definition of “woman”.</p> 
  <p>FWS launched another judicial review, which was dismissed, and after further appeals brought the case to the supreme court. Its crowdfunder has so far raised £230,000, including £70,000 donated by the Harry Potter author and activist <strong>JK Rowling</strong>.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Aidan O’Neill KC</strong> told the court that <strong>For Women Scotland (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/26/supreme-court-for-women-scotland-gender-representation-appeal-case">FWS)</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/26/supreme-court-for-women-scotland-gender-representation-appeal-case"> was arguing</a> that “in the Equality Act sex just means sex, as that word [is] used in ordinary, everyday language … by ordinary people”.</p> 
  <p>He argued that Scottish ministers’ position that the <strong>Equality Act</strong> created a “new legal category of ‘certificated sex’” – determined by what it said on a birth certificate, and whether that was later altered by a gender recognition certificate (GRC) – should be rejected.</p> 
  <p><strong>Ruth Crawford KC</strong>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/27/transgender-people-have-right-to-be-recognised-in-legally-acquired-gender-court-hears">responding on behalf of Scottish ministers</a>, argued that transgender people had “a fundamental right” to be recognised in their legally acquired gender. She said the <strong>Gender Recognition Act 2004</strong> was clear that a GRC changed sex “for all purposes” and someone with a GRC was entitled to legal protections “just as much as others enjoy those protections who are recorded as a woman at birth”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">What could happen?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>If the <strong>UK supreme court</strong> rules in favour of the <strong>Scottish government</strong>, it may recommend that the <strong>Equality Act</strong> is clarified to set out the rights of trans women.</p> 
  <p>If it rules in favour of <strong>For Women Scotland (FWS)</strong>, there will be substantial pressure on the <strong>UK government</strong> to amend the act to exclude trans women from women-only spaces, and the Scottish government will need to reverse its policies on public boards.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">UK supreme court to rule on the legal definition of a woman</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Equalities campaigners in the UK are braced for a supreme court ruling that could have a significant impact on the rights of transgender people to use single-sex services.</strong></p> 
  <p>Five judges on the <strong>UK supreme court</strong> will rule on Wednesday morning whether or not the definition of woman in the <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/equality-act-2010">Equality Act 2010</a></strong> includes transgender women with gender recognition certificates (GRC).</p> 
  <p>The court’s decision is expected to lead to calls for the act to be rewritten, and could have a profound effect on the rights of transgender women to take places on public boards reserved for women, and to use spaces and services intended for women.</p> 
  <p>The case against the <strong>Scottish government</strong> was brought by the gender critical campaign group <strong>For Women Scotland</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/13/trans-women-can-take-seats-on-public-boards-set-aside-for-women-scottish-judge-rules">after judges in Edinburgh ruled</a> that ministers were right to say that trans women with a GRC could sit on public boards in posts reserved for women.</p> 
  <p>FWS, which is partly funded by the writer <strong>JK Rowling</strong> and has support from the campaign group <strong>Sex Matters</strong>, argues that the Equality Act’s definition of woman is limited only to people born biologically female.</p> 
  <p>They argue that a very clear definition by the court on what a woman is would also help clear up an ambiguity about who qualifies to use women’s services. They say people who self-identify as trans but do not have a gender recognition certificate are being allowed to use women-only services and spaces.</p> 
  <p>The Scottish government has defended its decision. Backed by trans rights advocates and lawyers it has told the court that the <strong>Gender Recognition Act 2004</strong> makes clear that a gender recognition certificate changes sex “for all purposes”.</p> 
  <p>The government’s lawyers argue that means someone with that certificate is entitled to legal protections “just as much as others enjoy those protections who are recorded as a woman at birth”.</p>
