<p>It is famed for resembling the silhouette of a T rex. But the view of Kelingking beach in Bali will never be the same again, due to the construction of a new, 182-metre tall glass elevator that is meant to increase tourism to the area.</p> <p>Kelingking Beach sits on the coast of Nusa Penida, an island off Bali about a 45-minute ferry ride from Denpasar. The site is popular on the tourist track, with a breathtaking aerial view of a rock formation resembling a dinosaur and a treacherous path to the beach below.</p> <p>The developer, China Kaishi Group, began construction on the multimillion-dollar elevator project in July 2023. Video footage shared in recent weeks shows the view of the beach now marred by a large metal structure that extends from the cliffs to the sands below.</p> <p>Local outrage over the project prompted the Indonesia tourism ministry to stress last week it has been supervising the effort since it began to reflect a “commitment to sustainability, safety and cleanliness”, Indonesian news agency <a href="https://en.antaranews.com/news/388917/ri-govt-monitors-bali-glass-elevator-for-eco-compliance">Antara reported</a>.</p> <p>Bali authorities temporarily <a href="https://en.antaranews.com/news/389265/bali-halts-kelingking-beach-glass-elevator-project-amid-concerns">suspended construction</a> on the elevator on Friday, saying the project lacked some necessary permits.</p> <p>“If the project violates spatial regulations, enforcement must proceed,” I Made Supartha, the head of a committee on planning and permits in the Bali legislature, told reporters recently, according to Antara. “We want to ensure there’s no further activity on site.”</p> <p>The Balinese government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the project’s future.</p>    <p>Hariyanto, a deputy at the ministry, said last week the elevator could be a boon to tourism and increase the amount of time tourists spent on the island. The official told Indonesia’s Tempo magazine that any claims the construction had impeded tourism were not true, noting visitor numbers to the beach had risen more than 35% between 2023 and 2024.</p> <p>“Looking ahead, tourist visits are expected to remain high, even as the construction of the elevator continues,” Hariyanto, who goes by one name, told the magazine.</p> <p>Still, the development has sparked frustrations on the island. The <a href="https://thebalisun.com/progress-on-nusa-penidas-kelingking-beach-elevator-shocks-balis-tourists/">Bali Sun reports</a> one local resident, Made Sediana, said it was a “shame that the beautiful view of Kelingking beach has been destroyed”, adding she thought tourists visited the site to “enjoy the panorama, not the lifts”.</p> <p>China Kaishi Group were approached for comment.</p> <p>The developer celebrated the project during a groundbreaking in July 2023, saying the project would include two external sightseeing elevators, a sky cafe, restaurant and a large, 400sqm panoramic overlook.</p> <p>The company said in a media release at the time the project would boost tourism numbers and provide a safe viewing area for travellers.</p> <p>“Due to the steep cliffs surrounding it, with a vertical drop of nearly 200 meters, reaching the beach requires a nearly two-hour climb down the cliffs, posing a certain degree of danger,” it said in a translated release. “The construction of the ‘world’s first cliffside sightseeing elevator’ perfectly solved this problem – the elevator not only shortens the distance from the cliff to the beach to just one minute but also provides tourists with a safe, comfortable, and experiential travel experience.”</p> <p>But some have questioned why a lift to the beach was necessary at all.</p> <p>Kelingking beach is closed to swimming at all times due to dangerous currents. A French tourist died at the beach two weeks ago after entering the water, despite several warnings against doing so.</p> <p>Evacuations from the area are difficult due to the dangerous path from the cliffs. The developers of the elevator have cited those rescues as one use for the project aside from tourism.</p> <p>Niluh Djelantik, an Indonesian senator for Bali who has been outspoken against the project, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s program Foreign Correspondent in 2024 that she would “never” ride the elevator, saying it reflected a growing problem with development in the province.</p> <p>She posted her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1506750057234342">renewed opposition</a> to the project on social media this week, saying locals had voiced their discontent “long before this elevator was built”. Djelantik added the dangerous ocean conditions would see the project escorting visitors “to the gate of disaster”.</p>
