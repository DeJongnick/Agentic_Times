<p>Aaron Sorkin is officially working on a sequel to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/14/the-social-network-review">The Social Network</a>.</p> <p>Last year, the Oscar-winning writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/26/aaron-sorkin-january-6-film">revealed</a> he was working on a film that would revisit the subject of Facebook, and <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/the-social-network-sequel-aaron-sorkin-1236439539/">Deadline</a> has now reported that The Social Network Part II is in development at Sony Pictures yet isn’t a “straight sequel”.</p> <p>The original film, which traced the early days of Facebook and its creator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, was directed by David Fincher. Sorkin is rumoured to be directing the follow-up.</p> <p>“I blame Facebook for January 6,” he said in 2024 on a special edition of <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2024/4/26/24141166/aaron-sorkin-live-from-dc-ai-hollywood">The Town podcast</a>, live from Washington DC. When asked to explain why, he responded: “You’re gonna need to buy a movie ticket.”</p> <p>The Social Network was an adaptation of Ben Mezrich’s book The Accidental Billionaires, and the sequel will be based on the Wall Street Journal series <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjMkmTwjb5kvTtvx019hI8JyE5m7yfyCidTkkNuacWpy4naNLNm7zHo62a7kqQ%3D&amp;gaa_ts=685c5f65&amp;gaa_sig=9zkTc9isenVKbmoV0FZfe2uLySmX2f7BUre_7F-TCF56u1xbp-4Ds-KPDqJPGmOrLedsyYW_eYJCXc9dhY5m8w%3D%3D">The Facebook Files</a>. The 2021 investigation examined the damage caused by the social networking site and how internal findings had been buried. Subjects included the influence on the January 6 riot and the mental health of teenage users.</p> <p>“Facebook has been, among other things, tuning its algorithm to promote the most divisive material possible,” Sorkin said. He added: “There is supposed to be a constant tension at Facebook between growth and integrity – there isn’t.</p> <p>Jesse Eisenberg, who earned an Oscar nomination for playing Zuckerberg in the original, has yet to be officially attached to the project. He recently directed the Oscar-winning comedy drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/08/a-real-pain-review-jesse-eisenberg-kieran-culkin">A Real Pain</a> and will next be seen in the third <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155486/now-you-see-me">Now You See Me</a> movie.</p> <p>The Social Network made $224m worldwide and won three Oscars.</p> <p>Zuckerberg has been critical of the film, including in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMW7-yk296U">podcast interview</a>.</p> <p>“It was weird, man,” he said. “They got all these very specific details of what I was wearing, or these specific things correct, but then the whole narrative arc around my motivations and all this stuff were, like, completely wrong.”</p> <p>Sorkin’s last film was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/07/being-the-ricardos-review-nicole-kidman-makes-light-comedy-look-like-hard-work-in-lucille-ball-biopic">Being the Ricardos</a>, starring Nicole Kidman as Lucille Ball.</p>
