<p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted position:</strong> 2nd (NB: this is not necessarily Ed Aarons’ prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)</p> <p><strong>Last season’s position:</strong> 2nd</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/arsenal-kit/giv-32554HlDQwOEgK5dw" data-alt="Arsenal kits"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/arsenal-kit/giv-32554HlDQwOEgK5dw">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Prospects</h2> <p>Mikel Arteta vowed this would be a “big summer” after finishing as runners-up in the Premier League for a third season in succession and the new sporting director, Andrea Berta, has delivered on a number of signings in his first transfer window. The question now for Arsenal supporters is whether Martín Zubimendi, Christian Nørgaard, Noni Madueke, Viktor Gyökeres, Cristhian Mosquera and Kepa Arrizabalaga can help them take that elusive final step to becoming champions for the first time since the Invincibles in 2004.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/26/arsenal-complete-64m-deal-to-sign-viktor-gyokeres-from-sporting-lisbon#:~:text=Arsenal%20complete%20%C2%A364m%20deal%20to%20sign%20striker%20Viktor%20Gy%C3%B6keres%20from%20Sporting">The arrival of Gyökeres</a> will certainly quieten the clamour for a new No 9 that has rumbled on for several years, although the pressure will immediately be on the Sweden striker to hit the ground running. The longstanding target Zubimendi should provide metronomic accuracy at the base of a new-look midfield that Arteta will hope can continue to get the best out of Declan Rice and rejuvenate the captain, Martin Ødegaard, while Madueke will surely provide much better back-up for their talisman Bukayo Saka than Raheem Sterling managed last season and could also push Gabriel Martinelli for a starting place on the left flank.</p> <p>But even with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/26/myles-lewis-skelly-signs-new-arsenal-contract-five-years">teenage sensations Myles Lewis-Skelly</a> and Ethan Nwaneri having committed their futures to the club after enjoying outstanding breakthrough seasons, there remain concerns about a lack of creativity in the squad. A move for Crystal Palace’s FA Cup hero Eberechi Eze could depend on players departing before the end of August to balance the books.</p> <p>Yet while Arsenal may end up paying more than £200m for the additions to their squad so far, seeing champions Liverpool <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/13/liverpool-agree-116m-fee-with-bayer-leverkusen-for-florian-wirtz#:~:text=Liverpool%20agree%20%C2%A3116m%20deal,Florian%20Wirtz%20%7C%20Liverpool%20%7C%20The%20Guardian">comfortably outspend them</a> after finishing 10 points ahead last season has left many fans wondering if they have gone far enough. The squad definitely looks stronger than this time last year but with other rivals also closing in, it could be make or break for Arteta.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/T7bk7/1/" data-alt="Past five seasons"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/T7bk7/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>The manager</h2> <p>Ending yet another campaign without silverware was a bitter pill to swallow for Arteta, who celebrated his fifth anniversary in charge just before Christmas. A solitary FA Cup a few months after his appointment is not a fair reflection on the progress Arsenal have made since then – especially <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/16/real-madrid-arsenal-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report">given the run to the Champions League semi-finals</a> last season – but Arteta knows he will be ultimately judged on delivering titles. He made no secret of his frustration over the lack of cover in Arsenal’s squad as the injuries mounted up last year. With plenty of reinforcements now added, Arteta must seize his opportunity.</p> <h2>Off-field picture</h2> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/04/arsenal-handed-shock-blow-with-edu-poised-to-leave-sporting-director-role-mikel-arteta">surprise departure of Edu</a> Gaspar in November disrupted plans for the January transfer window but Berta has provided some fresh perspective since joining in March. Arsenal’s American owner, Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, was rated as the most valuable sports ownership group on the planet in July at an estimated $21.3bn (£16.1bn) thanks to a portfolio that also includes the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams, the NHL’s Colorado Avalanche and the NBA’s Denver Nuggets. So funding another summer spending spree wasn’t an issue after keeping the powder relatively dry last year. It – like Arsenal’s supporters, who pay for one of the most expensive season tickets in the country – however, will want a return for its investment at some point.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/L9JoF/1/" data-alt="Last season"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/L9JoF/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Star signing</h2> <p>No Arsenal player managed 10 goals in the Premier League last season so the onus is on Gyökeres – who scored a staggering 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting – to fill the void. The only issue is that the 27-year-old never played in English football’s top flight despite being on Brighton’s books and then excelling in the Championship for Coventry. He will be expecting to get plenty of opportunities in a side that usually dominate their opponents in midfield but struggled to break teams down last season, drawing 14 times in the league. Having eventually opted for Gyökeres rather than RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko or Alexander Isak of Newcastle, Arsenal must now find a way to utilise his obvious strengths.</p>    <h2>Stepping up</h2> <p>It is highly probable that only Premier League regulations prevented Max Dowman from taking Nwaneri’s record as the competition’s youngest ever player last season. The attacking midfielder has been training with Arsenal’s first team squad since celebrating his 15th birthday at the turn of the year and was described as “special” by Arteta after coming off the bench to win a penalty in their pre-season win against Newcastle in Singapore. “What he’s done against this team in the time that he had on the pitch is something certainly not common to witness for a 15-year-old,” he said. Dowman is expected to be handed an opportunity sooner rather than later and it will be intriguing to see what impact he can have.</p> <h2>A big season for …</h2> <p>Martin Ødegaard was the first to admit that his performances last season lacked their usual sparkle, with a return of three league goals his lowest since moving to north London permanently in 2021. The 26-year-old captain was also substituted on 12 occasions after missing part of the season due to an ankle injury as he struggled to find his best form. The Norwegian must rekindle his relationship with Saka that has proved so effective down the years, while Arteta will be hoping that Gyökeres can finish off some of the chances Ødegaard will inevitably create given the lack of other options besides the inexperienced Nwaneri and Dowman.</p>
