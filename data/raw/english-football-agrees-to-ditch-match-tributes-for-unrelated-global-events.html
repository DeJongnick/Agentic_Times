<p>English football authorities have agreed they will no longer hold minute’s silences or other forms of commemoration for events that do not directly relate to the game.</p> 
<p>The decision was made jointly by the EFL, FA and Premier League following the creation of a new committee, the World Events Working Group (WEWG), to assess the sport’s response to global events such as natural disasters and terror incidents.</p>

<p>The news comes after a number of occasions in which authorities were questioned over their commemoration policies and deciding which events should merit tributes before matches.</p> 
<p>According <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/football-cuts-tributes-for-global-events-unrelated-to-the-sport-p2r90dqnj">to the Times</a>, the new system would only allow for the use of a minute’s silence if there was a strong connection to football.</p> 
<p>The FA faced criticism two years ago after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/19/fa-recognises-hurt-over-decision-not-to-light-wembley-arch-in-israel-colours">deciding not to light the Wembley arch</a> in acknowledgement of the 7 October attacks in Israel, despite having done so in support of Ukraine in 2022. The FA argued that its policy would now be only to illuminate the landmark for sporting or entertainment purposes.</p> 
<p>The change is likely to see individual clubs more often allowed to decide their own approach to commemoration. In October, the Premier League and EFL did not hold a league-wide tribute for the two men who died following the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue. However, Bolton, Salford and the two Manchester clubs, City and United, did stage tributes.</p> 
<p>For events of national significance, such as the death of a monarch, it is thought that the government will provide guidance on how the sport should pay its respects. The new policies will not effect Remembrance Sunday commemorations nor affect player-led actions, such as the taking of the knee during Black History month.</p>
