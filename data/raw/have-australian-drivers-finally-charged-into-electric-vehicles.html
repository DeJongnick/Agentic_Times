<p>Newcomer brands and luxury marques are dominating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/23/ev-electric-vehicles-sales-rise-australia-government-strategies">booming electric car sales</a> as mainstream players struggle to match the pace of a fast-evolving EV market.</p> <p>The top three selling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/electric-vehicles-australia">electric vehicles</a> in Australia in 2023 were from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/05/tesla-china-recall-autopilot">Tesla</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/02/chinas-byd-overtakes-tesla-as-top-selling-electric-car-seller">BYD</a>, between them accounting for two-thirds of the 87,217 electric cars sold, according to figures released by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries.</p> <p>Of the top 10 selling EVs, only two mainstream brands – MG and Kia – had cars on the leader board, with the likes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/30/big-name-evs-here-are-the-new-models-launching-for-first-time-in-australia">Toyota</a>, Mazda, Hyundai and Nissan nowhere to be seen.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2020/08/table-tool/embed/app/main.html?spreadsheet=11DRJ8lnH5GkVwM0KiyaFklau7QWIa2xKN36DzoLQdQ4" data-alt="Electric vehicle sales by make/model for 2023"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2020/08/table-tool/embed/app/main.html?spreadsheet=11DRJ8lnH5GkVwM0KiyaFklau7QWIa2xKN36DzoLQdQ4">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>And prestige and luxury brands accounted for 70% of EV sales, with Volvo (35.5% of its sales being EV), Mercedes-Benz (13.1%), BMW (11.4%), Mini (12.9%) and Porsche (8.8%) above the industry average of 7.2% EV penetration.</p> <p>A surprising 36% of all prestige and luxury cars are now powered by electricity, although the figure is dragged up by EV-only brands such as Tesla and Polestar.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/30/big-name-evs-here-are-the-new-models-launching-for-first-time-in-australia">Big-name EVs: here are the new models launching for the first time in Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In contrast, EVs from the top six selling brands in the country – Toyota, Mazda, Ford, Kia, Hyundai and Mitsubishi – accounted for a combined 6% of the electric car market;

Tesla sells that many Model Ys in about 19 days.</p> <p>“We want to bring a car to market that’s suitable for our buyers, takes the risk out of the buyer equation and gives them a damn happy experience,” says Sean Hanley, Toyota Australia vice-president of sales, marketing and franchise operations.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/01/amazing-queensland-mum-uses-electric-car-to-save-sons-life-with-dialysis-during-power-outage">Queensland woman uses electric car to run her son’s dialysis machine during power cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He argues EVs are better suited to city driving.</p> <p>Towards the middle of the year there will also be electric mid-sized SUVs from Volkswagen, Skoda, Nissan and Audi, as well as the BYD Seal U, Kia EV5 and Polestar 4.</p> <p>Later this year Porsche will stop producing petrol versions of its top selling vehicle, the Macan SUV, and replace them with an all-electric new generation car.</p> <p>It is a bold move from a brand with a rich history in high octane performance but is indicative of a fast-changing market.</p> <h2>Small EV impact yields big results</h2> <p>There’s also EV action heating up in the hatchback market courtesy of the late-year arrival of three circa-$40,000 contenders: MG4, BYD Dolphin and GWM Ora.</p> <p>Between the trio they accounted for more than 1,000 sales a month in the final quarter of 2023.</p> <p>It meant those three EVs – each sourced from China – stole 14% of the small hatch/sedan market that includes big players such as the Toyota Corolla, Hyundai i30, Mazda3 and Kia Cerato.</p> <p>It is a remarkable achievement given the relative lack of brand recognition.</p> <h2>Canberra doing the EV heavy lifting</h2> <p>The nation’s political heartland loves EVs, according to the sales figures.</p> <p>Whereas the national average EV take-up is 7.2%, in the Australian Capital Territory it surged to 18.3%.</p> <p>Only one state – NSW – was above the national average, with 7.7% of all vehicles sold an EV.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2020/08/table-tool/embed/app/main.html?spreadsheet=1lhYhu_FfDti27OB430PfRXTCmBCVPcrbf_0L-JQ1slI" data-alt="Electric vehicle sales by state in 2023"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2020/08/table-tool/embed/app/main.html?spreadsheet=1lhYhu_FfDti27OB430PfRXTCmBCVPcrbf_0L-JQ1slI">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly the Northern Territory had the lowest EV uptake, at just 2.7%.</p> <p>And despite trouncing eastern states in its shift to renewables only 5.5% of new cars sold in South Australian took advantage of that cleaner electricity.</p> <p>Last year also gave an insight into the impact rebates and incentives can have on EV take-up.</p> <p>Midyear Victoria shelved its $3,000 electric car rebate almost a year earlier than planned and it saw sales drop.</p> <p>In the first half of the year 7.5% of vehicles sold in Victoria were electric, whereas in the second half that dropped to 6.1%.</p> <p>And in the few weeks Victorians had to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/29/victorians-rush-to-buy-evs-in-last-days-before-state-government-dumps-rebate-scheme">snap up the last of the rebates</a> before they ended on 30 June, EV sales soared: 16.1% of all EVs sold in Victoria in 2023 were bought in June, whereas the rest of the country was at 11.5%.</p>
