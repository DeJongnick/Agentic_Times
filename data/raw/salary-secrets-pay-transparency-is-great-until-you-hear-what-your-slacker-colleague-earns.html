<p><strong>Name: </strong>Pay transparency.</p> <p><strong>Age: </strong>Merely a twinkle in government ministers’ eyes.</p> <p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Potentially a bit can of worms-y.</p> <p><strong>You can’t have a problem with pay transparency. It’s a good thing! </strong>It is! It highlights and helps tackle gender, ethnicity, age and disability pay gaps for a start, which is why the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-launches-call-for-evidence-to-break-down-barriers-to-opportunity-at-work">UK government</a> is looking at ways to promote more openness around what people earn.</p> <p><strong>They should make nonsensically vague salary info in job ads illegal for starters. Don’t tell me it’s “competitive” </strong><strong>– tell me if I’ll be able to afford to eat. </strong>You’re in luck – one suggestion is making employers include salary bracket or specific salary in job ads. Others include banning asking candidates about their pay history and making the provision of clear information on pay structures and career progression mandatory.</p> <p><strong>Didn’t the EU do something similar recently? </strong>Yes, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/970/oj/eng">EU Pay Transparency Directive</a>, which comes into force next year, introduces similar measures – it also bans pay secrecy clauses, which stop employees from discussing their salaries with colleagues.</p> <p><strong>Good stuff. So what</strong><strong> i</strong><strong>s the problem? </strong>Well, speaking of discussing what you earn, one of <a href="https://www.lewissilkin.com/insights/2025/04/24/pay-transparency-directive-measures-on-the-horizon-for-the-uk">the other measures the UK is considering</a> is “providing employees with information on their pay level and how their pay compares with those doing the same role or work of equal value”.</p> <p><strong>So? That sounds positive. </strong>You know your colleague, Darren?</p> <p><strong>The wastrel who moseys in at five to 10</strong><strong>, scrolls through his socials for an hour then disappears to the </strong><strong>gents until </strong><strong>12</strong><strong>, takes two hours for lunch and leaves at four</strong><strong>? </strong><strong> </strong>Yep, that Darren. Well, imagine finding out he’s earning 20 grand more than you?</p> <p><strong>Is he????? </strong>I don’t know. But what if, under these new proposed rules, you found out that he was?</p> <p><strong>I would go full Godzilla, ripping through the open space screaming, </strong><strong>tearing out cables and kicking over bins</strong><strong>. </strong>You see the problem. There’s a certain potential for, let’s say, tension, if people find out they’re earning less than their colleagues (especially crap ones).</p> <p><strong>But, come on, how likely is it that employers will be forced, or choose, to reveal specific individualised information on who earns exactly what? </strong>Admittedly, very unlikely – this is all still theoretical. But look what happened <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42833551">when the BBC published pay bracket information on presenters</a>? All hell broke loose!</p> <p><strong>You mean a scandalous gender pay gap was exposed and addressed? </strong>I see your point. But we’re funny about money – <a href="https://hrnews.co.uk/shhh-most-brits-prefer-not-to-talk-about-their-wages/">a 2021 poll</a> found 36% of British people don’t even tell their spouses what they earn. Pay transparency provisions are definitely a good thing, but this could get messy.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“So how much do you earn?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“£7,840 more than you and I’m worth every penny, Darren.”</p>
