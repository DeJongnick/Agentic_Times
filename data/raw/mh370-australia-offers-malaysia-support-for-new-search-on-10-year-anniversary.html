About 40 minutes later it disappeared from radar and its fate remains unknown.</p> <p>On Sunday the Malaysian government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/03/flight-mh370-relatives-call-for-new-search-10-years-after-disappearance">said it was in talks with the US marine robotics company Ocean Infinity</a> regarding a new search. The company says it is willing and able to return to the search and has submitted a proposal to the Malaysian government.</p> <p>The Malaysia initially did a surface search in the South <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a> Sea and the Strait of Malacca. But electronic signals recrded by satellites indicated the plane had turned around, flown until it ran out of fuel, then plunged into the Indian Ocean between Western Australia and Antarctica.</p> <p>At that point Australia took over the search, with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau leading the underwater search from May 2014 to early 2017.</p> <p>The Australian Defence Force, Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and the CSIRO also contributed to the search.</p>
