<h1>The best restaurant in London? You literally can't get a table</h1>

<p>There is a raw kind of beauty to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/">Tripadvisor</a> review. Let your eye flow down the page and poetry emerges. “Like a plate of blood / I wanted to scream / The worst / The worst / The worst pasty in London.” My boyfriend runs a deli – they had their favourite bad Tripadvisor review printed on tea towels: “When I’m lying on my deathbed, I’ll regret the hour I spent here.” People email him with threats – if you don’t give me and my wife a free meal on Saturday, I’ll post a bad review. Tripadvisor holds plenty of such secrets in its one star reviews, while hiding up at the other end, in the lush grass of its five star hits, are writers paid to push restaurants up the charts.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Six months after creating The Shed at Dulwich websit they were, according to Tripadvisor, the best restaurant in London</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was an earlier job doing just this, at £10 a go, that gave <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/charlottesville-neo-nazis-vice-news-hbo"><em>Vice</em></a> writer Oobah Butler the idea of going a step further, from creating fake restaurant reviews to creating a fake restaurant. <a href="https://www.theshedatdulwich.com/">The Shed</a>, reads its website, is “an appointment-only restaurant located in south London”. It’s not. There are vivid photographs of burrata and scallops, and miniature chocolate soufflés and something clever with an egg. Except they’re shaving foam, toilet bleach blocks and a sponge covered in instant coffee. As his friends began posting five star reviews and the Shed climbed Tripadvisor’s ranks, the phone started ringing. Do they have a table tomorrow night? Could a family book a table in four months’ time? Nope. By the end of August, they were at #156. By the autumn they were #30. On 1 November, six months after creating <a href="https://www.theshedatdulwich.com/">The Shed at Dulwich</a> website and propping a fried egg jauntily against a bare foot, they were, according to Tripadvisor, the best restaurant in London.</p> <p>I don’t know if you’ve ever been to London, but here we have a lot of restaurants. A LOT of restaurants. Chicken ones, fish ones, ones where, as seen in <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/woman-ripped-ex-boyfriends-testicle-11655609">this week’s papers</a>, a waitress will bite out her exes’ testicle when he refuses her a threesome with his new girlfriend, ones where the food is horrific but you don’t want to hurt the manager’s feelings because of her extremely sad eyes, ones that are so fancy they literally rotate, ones that give a menu without prices to the woman for fear of breaking her hymen. So this is some accolade, this, the “<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/434gqw/i-made-my-shed-the-top-rated-restaurant-on-tripadvisor">best restaurant in London</a>”, and its arrival at the top of the list is eye-opening, not just because it exposes the truth about online reviews, but because it exposes the truth about how we live.</p> <p>Does that sound a bit grand? A quenelle of shaving foam fools the internet and suddenly I’m Jean Paul Fartre? But look at us: we are a people so cautious, so risk-averse that a call from an unknown number causes us to throw our phones into the fire. We are the Tripadvisor generation, our time so precious that before going out for lunch we must memorise the menu like a meaty acrostic, our lives so expensive that before investing in an attraction we must educate ourselves with every possible iteration of events. “Don’t waste your time hearing about sad things,” says Sergio B on Tripadvisor about the Anne Frank house, “but it’s up to you.” “Nothing shocked me, other than the pile of human hair,” said user Ricky Thompson, after visiting Auschwitz. “I had seen much worse on TV and the internet.” Despite Thompson’s poor review, it is still rated the number one attraction in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/27/auschwitz-short-history-liberation-concentration-camp-holocaust">Oświęcim</a>.</p> <p>The big draw of the Shed, of course, was the combination of excellent reviews and overt impossibility. You literally couldn’t get a table. Which made it the perfect restaurant – the chase to be first to share an iPhone photo of their moody Dulwich tea, to swagger into the office with interesting comments on the plating choices of an ungettable feast. We are grabbers. We are scratchers. Once something has been waved in front of us with the promise of exclusivity and proof of a five-star rating we will clamber through the internet, we will crawl through dirt to own it. We are all tourists online, in the thrall of Sergio B lighting a cigarette outside an Amsterdam coffee shop before crafting his Anne Frank review, and we’re all potential Ricky Thompsons, wanting to be first to say Auschwitz was crap.</p> <p>Could this ghost restaurant, that served pretend food to nobody, be the straw that breaks Tripadvisor’s back? And with it our gullible prudence, and our scrabble for only the best?</p> <p><em>Email Eva at </em><a href="mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk"><em>e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</em></a><em> or follow her on Twitter </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"><em>@EvaWiseman</em></a></p>
