<p>The governor of California, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom</a>, has sued Fox News for defamation and demanded $787m, almost exactly the same amount Fox paid in a previous defamation case over election misinformation.</p> <p>In the new lawsuit, filed on Friday, Newsom accuses the Fox host Jesse Watters of falsely claiming Newsom lied about a phone call with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, who recently ordered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/los-angeles-trump-troop-deployments">national guard troops into Los Angeles.</a></p> <p>Newsom’s attorneys say Watters aired a deceptively edited clip of Trump suggesting he spoke with the governor just before the military deployment, when in fact records show the call occurred days earlier, on 7 June. The lawsuit alleges that Fox manipulated the footage to push a false narrative that Newsom had misled the public.</p> <p>Trump had told reporters on 10 June he had spoken with Newsom “a day ago”, appearing to imply a conversation occurred on the same day that 700 US marines were deployed to LA.</p> <p>Newsom denied Trump’s claim, <a href="https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1932486104583975413">writing on X</a> minutes later: “There was no call. Not even a voicemail. Americans should be alarmed that a President deploying Marines onto our streets doesn’t even know who he’s talking to.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/gavin-newsom-california-governor-donald-trump">‘This moment was thrust upon him’: Gavin Newsom steps up to parry Trump’s ‘wrecking ball’ attacks on American democracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lawsuit says that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news">Fox’s</a> own reporting confirmed Newsom’s version. While Watters aired Trump’s edited quote and asked viewers “Why would Newsom lie?”, the host simultaneously showed a screenshot of Trump’s call history, which confirmed the most recent call was 7 June.</p> <p>Newsom’s complaint also accuses the network of violating California’s Unfair Competition Law by engaging in deceptive business practices.</p> <p>The damages sought mirror the $787.5m Fox paid Dominion Voting Systems in 2023 to settle a separate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/24/fox-dominion-lawsuit-elections-confidence-restoration">defamation case</a> over election misinformation.</p> <p>“If Fox News wants to lie to the American people on Donald Trump’s behalf, it should face consequences – just like it did in the Dominion case,” Newsom told <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/27/newsom-sues-fox-news-defamation-case-00429168">Politico</a> in a statement. “Until Fox is willing to be truthful, I will keep fighting against their propaganda machine.”</p> <p>The governor’s team told Politico that they would drop the case if Fox retracts the claims and Watters issues an on-air apology. Newsom said legal costs would come from his campaign funds, and that if the case is successful the proceeds will go to support anti-Trump causes.</p> <p>A Fox News spokesperson said: “Governor Newsom’s transparent publicity stunt is frivolous and designed to chill free speech critical of him. We will defend this case vigorously and look forward to it being dismissed.”</p> <p>Trump has had his own legal battles with media outlets. He recently secured a $15m settlement from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/14/abc-george-stephanopoulos-trump-15-million">ABC</a> over comments made by George Stephanopoulos, and he has sued CBS over alleged interview manipulation by its 60 Minutes program during the 2024 campaign, a case which remains unresolved.</p>
