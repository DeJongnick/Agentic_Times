<p>There are few gains from the climate crisis, but a new bee species colonising UK shores is one of them. The European orchard bee, <em>Osmia cornuta</em>, which has established itself in southern England, is an important pollinator because it is among the first to begin foraging in the spring. On the continent, colonies are encouraged to live in cherry and apple orchards since they are said to be better pollinators than honeybees. It is about the size of a honeybee, but more brightly coloured.</p> <p>The UK was once too cold for the species since it emerges early in the year and needs warmth. It was first identified in Greenwich in London in 2014 and has spread rapidly since. This spring has been perfect – warmer and drier than usual, so the population is likely to continue to grow.</p> <p>It is a solitary bee in that the females lay eggs in a hole in wood, masonry or a bank and collect pollen to provide food for their offspring before sealing the egg up in the cavity. When the new bee emerges from the cocoon it digs its way out. Bee houses made of hollow canes are ideal for this species and it likes warm places and so is likely to be found in urban areas. </p> <p>• The headline of this article was changed on 7 May 2025.
