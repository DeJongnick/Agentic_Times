<p>I really appreciate this opportunity. I want to say that I read the Guardian almost every morning, and it is a terrible start to my day! Sometimes I wish you jokers would cut back on the all investigating of all the bad stuff that’s happening because it’s a major downbuzz.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jan/09/lucy-smith-the-10-funniest-things-i-have-ever-seen-on-the-internet">Lucy Smith: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But I do respect your work.</p> <p>As the world’s democracies are pulled back into darkness by social media disinformation funded by corporations and billionaires, I appreciate the Guardian’s journalism as one of the last reminders of civilisation. So as a token of my appreciation, I will now reveal 10 funny things I remember from back before Steve Jobs ruined the internet by making it appealing to idiots via phones.</p> <h2>1. The New Zealand prime minister calls the election drunk</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRRwYuYnMbk"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CRRwYuYnMbk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>People from overseas might be stunned to learn that in 1984 the then New Zealand prime minister, Robert Muldoon, struggling in the polls, went into his office and got wasted. When he came out later that night (visibly drunk) he fronted the nation’s media and announced a snap election. Spoiler alert: the election went badly and he famously closed a TV debate by telling his opponent he loved him on air and then allegedly started to cry. That was when New Zealand got its first dose of neoliberalism. What a country!</p> <h2>2. Clarke and Dawe</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m5qxZm_JqM"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3m5qxZm_JqM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>John Clarke is one of New Zealand’s greatest comedians and one of the first to break through in Australia … I hope to be the second!</p> <h2>3. The Topp Twins</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2oYYawc9EA"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V2oYYawc9EA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>One of New Zealand’s most beloved variety acts, Jools and Lynda Topp are two yodelling lesbians who have spent their career fighting for gender, sexual and racial justice. Check them out on YouTube; they have an amazing vibe and I guarantee you will smile watching them.</p> <h2>4. Jenny by Flight Of The Conchords</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHTxqk_UxHo"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XHTxqk_UxHo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Flight of the Conchords’ One Night Stand on HBO was the performance that got me into comedy. Like every other 18-year-old in 2006 I was obsessed with them and the fact they were Kiwis was a genuine source of national pride for me.</p> <h2>5. 100 tampons</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDRgzoM2mw"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gvDRgzoM2mw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I love musical comedy so much I add it to my phone and play it in my general music mix like it’s Rihanna. Then I get in the car and my passenger is like “WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?” I love Marcia Belsky so much I genuinely get chills when she sings the part where Sally Ride feels proud.</p> <h2>6. Karen wants her $20 back</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFWsF1aJKvE"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VFWsF1aJKvE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This is embarrassing but I decided to chuck in one of my own clips … I was going to put in just the viral voice message that inspired this story but that’s only 60 seconds long. I may as well give you the option of watching more if you want it … I should also mention that Karen and I also did a podcast available now on all platfor … OK I’ll stop!</p> <h2>7. Daniel Kitson at Melbourne comedy festival gala</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV_NIdW4VnM"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oV_NIdW4VnM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Gala sets are really hard because they’re so short. This is probably the best I’ve ever seen.</p> <h2>8. Reusable Bags Song by Two Hearts</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNca2ngaT-U"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bNca2ngaT-U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Another cracking gala performance. Two Hearts (Laura Daniel and Joseph Moore) are the next great NZ duo and probably our best musical act at the moment. Intentional shots fired at my brother, Paul Williams.</p> <h2>9. Aamer Rahman on reverse racism</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw_mRaIHb-M"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dw_mRaIHb-M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I love political comedy and Aamer Rahman is pretty much the king, now that Dave Chappelle has well and truly abdicated the throne by retiring from the art form to focus on destroying his own legacy.</p> <h2>10. Peacock and Gamble</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbtPByY-bmU"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FbtPByY-bmU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Probably the best modern double act I’ve ever seen. I love Ian Boldsworth (Peacock) and Ed Gamble is the perfect straight man. It’s also cool to see him before he got shredded!</p> <p>Congratulations! You made it to the end of my list! May peace prevail on earth! Kia ora!</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Guy Williams is touring Australia and New Zealand from 7 February (and potentially the UK later in 2025). <a href="https://www.guywilliams.co.nz/">Visit his website for dates and ticket info</a></em></p></li> </ul>
