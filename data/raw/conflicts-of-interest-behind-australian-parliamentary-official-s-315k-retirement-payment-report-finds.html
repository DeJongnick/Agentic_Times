<p>An independent “fact-finding mission” into a $315,126 retirement payment to a senior parliamentary department official has found “multiple procedural failures” including overpayment, a disregard for specialist advice and “excessive pressure” applied in the payment’s timing.</p> <p>The report by Sydney barrister Fiona Roughley SC, <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/-/media/05_About_Parliament/54_Parliamentary_Depts/543_DPS/Publication/Roughley_Report_Summary.pdf">released Thursday</a>, found there were “conflicts of interest” and “conflicted persons” within the Department of Parliamentary Services involved in the decision-making process.</p> <p>In Senate estimates hearings in 2024, the former DPS secretary Rob Stefanic said he declared a conflict of interest with Cate Saunders, his former deputy secretary, in August 2022, due to a “close” personal relationship.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/18/rob-stefanic-finishes-up-as-head-of-parliamentary-services-cate-saunders-retirement-ntwnfb">Rob Stefanic finishes up as head of parliamentary services after scrutiny over retirement of deputy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saunders remained his subordinate for eight months until she was seconded to Services Australia, where she later accepted a $315,126 incentive payment for her retirement from the public service on 1 October 2023.</p> <p>The National Anti-Corruption Commission confirmed in March this year it was also conducting an investigation related to the subject matter of Roughley’s report.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Roughley’s report also found multiple procedural failures resulted in Saunders’ retirement payment deviating from public service guidance material, which “resulted in an increase in the quantum of the payment made”.</p> <p>The report highlighted additional concerns including the “exclusion”, “lack of involvement” and/or “disregard for the advice of specialist DPS payroll staff”.</p> <p>It also noted concerns about “excessive pressure applied on the timing of the payment”.</p> <p>The report made seven recommendations, including quarantining conflicted decision-makers from the process and documenting the reasons for making an offer.</p> <p>Stefanic told Senate estimates in 2024 that the working relationship between Saunders and himself was “transactional” after declaring a conflict of interest, and that his dealings with Saunders as her boss during that period were “purely administrative in nature”.</p> <p>The former long-serving secretary said he had formally declared a conflict of interest with Saunders due to “gossip” and “rumour” about their “close, personal” relationship.</p> <p>While the exit package was approved by the Department of Parliamentary Services, Stefanic told the hearing he was not involved in its signoff.</p> <p>The details arose across subsequent Senate estimates hearings.
