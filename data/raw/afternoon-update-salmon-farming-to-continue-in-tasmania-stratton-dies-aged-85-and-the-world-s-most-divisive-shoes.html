<p>Good afternoon. The Albanese government confirmed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/14/albanese-government-reaffirms-decision-to-allow-salmon-farming-in-tasmania-despite-fears-for-endangered-maugean-skate">it will permit salmon farming to continue in Macquarie Harbour in Tasmania</a>, despite concerns from conservationists about the risks to the endangered Maugean skate.</p> 
<p>The environment minister, Murray Watt, wrote to three environment groups on Wednesday to notify them of the widely expected decision, which follows the passage of amendments to Australia’s nature laws to protect the salmon industry earlier this year.</p> 
<p>The groups had asked the government in 2023 to reconsider a 2012 decision to allow a salmon farming expansion in Macquarie Harbour without an assessment under Australia’s environmental laws.</p> 
<p>Watt said all relevant information had been carefully considered before reaching his decision, but the Bob Brown Foundation and the Australia Institute accused Watt of condemning the skate to extinction. </p>
