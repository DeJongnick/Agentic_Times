Since Campbell and Stewart are centrists, they don’t have a lot to disagree on anyway, but it’s a noble idea, and a good phrase. And now it turns out that Donald Trump seems to have adopted it too.</p> <p>When Theresa May was PM, she had an excruciating press conference with Trump at Chequers when he half-heartedly played down an interview he had given to the Sun implying she he did not rate her much. The lack of repect was obvious. There was none of that today. The president did not try undermine Keir Starmer in any way, and although he acknowledged that they have a different view on Israel and Gaza, it was cordial and rational. Other potential disagreements did not arise, or were glossed over. Trump, unusually, was diplomatic.</p> <p>This meant the news quotient was on the low side. On Russia, Trump dropped hints about a new initiative against Russia, but it was hard to tell how serious it was. His analysis of the conflict backed up what his friend Christopher Ruddy was telling the Today programme this morning. (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/18/donald-trump-state-visit-uk-keir-starmer-labour-politics-latest-news?page=with%3Ablock-68cbb1bc8f088854dcd6aa5f#block-68cbb1bc8f088854dcd6aa5f"> 10.11am</a>.) There were no big announcements here.</p> <p>The declaration that Trump wants to buy or lease Bagram airbase from the Taliban was certainly novel. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/18/donald-trump-state-visit-uk-keir-starmer-labour-politics-latest-news?page=with%3Ablock-68cc23898f08e4203c9a7081#block-68cc23898f08e4203c9a7081">4.28pm</a>.) But is that much more than fantasy? Perhaps he’s just floating this potential territorial acquisition because he has finally accepted that his plans to annex Canada and Greenland aren’t going anywhere.</p> <p>Trump may have been at his most diplomatic, but that did not mean he had given up on shameless half-truths. His “Peter who?” response to the question about Mandelson will have caused much amusement at Westminster, and in the US his suggestion that Jimmy Kimmel was just fired for his ratings will be dismissed as a lie.</p> <p>Starmer’s answers on most topics were predictable, but his declaration that the Church of England has been “my church … all my life” was not something I think he has said publicly before. He is an athiest, and his election last year even promoted a debate in religious circles about whether having <a href="https://thecatholicherald.com/article/should-catholics-worry-about-having-an-atheist-prime-minister">an athiest PM was a problem</a>. Half a day with a Maga president, and is Starmer finding his faith? Probably not. But it was interesting anwyay. I will post the full words shortly.</p> <p>(If non-British readers find this confusing, it is worth pointing out that atheism and a loose allegiance to the Church of England are not at all incompatible.) </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68cc23898f08e4203c9a7081" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-18T15:28:26.881Z">4.28pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump says he wants to US to regain Bagram air base in Afghanistan, implying Taliban may negotiate its handover</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>During the press conference Donald Trump said that the US is going to try to regain control of the Bagram air base in Afghanistan.</p> <p>In response to a question about Ukraine, he said the US departure from Afghanistan under Joe Biden was a “total disaster”.

editor.</em></p> <p>Universities in England will face Ofsted-style summary judgments, with those failing to pass minimum quality standards likely to be punished, according to proposals published this morning by the Office for Students (OfS).</p> <p>The OfS’s <a href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/reforms-to-quality-regulation/the-future-of-quality-regulation-quick-guide-to-our-proposals/">revised Teaching excellence framework</a> (Tef) will see all universities given gold, silver, bronze or “requires improvement” ratings every three to five years, based on measures of student outcomes such as completion rates and graduate employment – with each university paying £25,000 for the assessment.</p> <p>Those given bronze or “requires improvement” grades face a range of potential punishments including restrictions on their ability to award degrees or recruit students.</p> <p>The OfS’s decision to link overall judgments to sanctions comes as Ofsted is moving in the opposite direction for schools in England, having just replaced overall grades such as outstanding or requires improvement with a new “report card” summary of its inspections.</p> <p>It comes as a new <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/52857-two-thirds-of-students-in-england-and-wales-say-university-is-poor-value-for-money">survey by YouGov</a> found that two-thirds of students in England and Wales said the standard of university education and graduate wage levels “are not enough to warrant the cost of English [or] Welsh university degrees”.</p> <p>However, 80% of the 900 students surveyed said they were satisfied with the quality of their degree course, and 78% said their degree would lead to a good job.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68cbf5098f08e4203c9a6dcd"

in past year, figures show</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Patrick Butler is the Guardian’s social policy editor.</em></p> <p>In one of the starkest indicators of the housing crisis, new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-revenue-expenditure-and-financing-england-2024-to-2025-individual-local-authority-data-outturn">official figures</a> have revealed English councils spent £2.8bn providing housing emergency housing for homeless families last year, an annual increase of 25%.</p> <p>The bill for so-called temporary accommodation – short-term lets and bed and breakfast hostels – has doubled in the last five years, and is and a growing threat to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/30/councils-in-england-facing-bankruptcy-as-lack-of-housing-pushes-up-costs">financial viability</a> of some councils.</p> <p>Private landlords have been accused on “cashing in” on the crisis – a third of the 2024-25 bill (£844m) went on putting up families in bed and breakfast rooms, with a further £1bn spent on nightly paid short-term lets.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/27/homelessness-crisis-councils-england-pay-above-market-rent">Guardian investigation</a> earlier this year found private landlords and hotel owners were charging councils up to 60% more than normal market rents for properties that were often dirty, overcrowded and unsuitable for families.</p> <p>Spiralling rent, insecure tenures, shortages of social housing, and housing benefit freezes have driven an explosion in family homelessness in recent years, with some councils now spending <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/30/englands-broken-housing-system-is-now-a-problem-no-council-can-avoid">over half their budget</a> on temporary accommodation.</p> <p>As of 31 March

In<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/18/farage-boris-feud-reform-tories/"> an article for the Daily Telegraph</a>, <strong>Gordon Rayner</strong> says the event degenerated into a row between the senior Tories over record of the last government.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>After [Nigel] Farage, [Marco] Rubio and [Scott] Bessent had left to attend another event, the Tory big beasts and a smattering of Reform bigwigs sat down to an evening of dinner and civil war.</p> <p>[Boris] Johnson, [Liz] Truss, former transport secretary, Mark Harper, and broadcaster, Andrew Neil, argued about the Tories’ record in government, particularly on immigration, and what the future direction of travel should be.</p> <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg, who could be regarded as the current standard-bearer of uniting the Right, (he even attended the Reform conference this month), tried and failed to argue that they should all work together for the good of the country. Reform members smiled wryly as they watched the Tories tear lumps out of each other.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is a lot of talk in the UK at the moment from people how think the right can only win the next election if the Conservatives and Reform UK can somehow work together. The former Tory minister Steve Baker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/15/keir-starmer-peter-mandelson-labour-reform-tories-uk-politics-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68c840438f084793c7c15d2f#block-68c840438f084793c7c15d2f">said only this week</a> he thought some sort of deal was unacceptable.</p> <p>But Rayner suggests that will be difficult. Referring to Boris Johnson, he quotes a “<strong>senior Reform figure</strong>” as saying:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>[Johnson] elicits a visceral emotion in our members. One of the most consensual opinions among Reform members is that he was a disaster, and has already claimed the title of the man who ended the Conservative party’s chances of ever regaining power.</p> <p>If we let him join Reform, there would be an exodus of 99.9% of our members.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68cbe5f28f08895801e07796" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-18T11:14:59.110Z">12.14pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-18T11:35:59.054Z">at 12.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68cbe4798f08895801e0777f" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/lisaocarroll"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-18T10:58:01.380Z">11.58am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">UK pharma sector awaits further details from Trump on tariff concessions from US</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Lisa O’Carroll is a senior Guardian correspondent covering trade.</em></p> <p>Deals on steel and tech are sealed, but two other sectors caught in the cross hairs of Donald Trump’s UK tariff deal are anxiously waiting for promises to be delivered by the US president today.<br><br>The US pledged a “significantly preferential” treatment of the UK’s pharma sector in June, which had yet to materialise.<br><br>While the presence of a GSK boss at last night’s banquet may indicate movement on a deal, the question is not just whether the UK gets a further discount on a 10% blanket tariff, but what is included.<br><br>The detail on the EU side has yet to materialise with Irish deputy prime minister <strong>Simon Harris</strong> telling the Guardian “a big body of work” has yet to be done to establish what exactly the 15% tariff would apply to.</p> <p>Trump locked in a 15%top tariff rate for pharmaceuticals exported from the EU as part of the joint statement released at the end of August, with a zero or close to zero rate on “generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients and chemical precursors”.<br><br>“We don’t have that list of what the generics is or for medical devices,” Harris said.</p> <p>Trump’s decision to impose 15% tariffs on imports of pharma from EU is already breaching a World Trade Organization agreement that tariffs are not imposed on most medicines for public health reasons.</p> <p>There is also an expectation both in the EU and in London that exports of wine and spirits will return to pre-Trump, rates when spirits were rated zero on import to the US and wine was rated between 0.5% and 1.8%.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-18T11:33:15.045Z">at 12.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68cbe1608f08895801e07746" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-18T10:40:37.896Z">11.40am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">First migrant deported to France under ‘one in, one out’ deal</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The first migrant has been sent back to France under the “one in, one out” returns deal, government sources have said.

In an interview with the Today programme, Ruddy, who has been a friend and informal adviser to the president for years, predicted that Trump would soon harden his stance against Russia. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>President Trump is not against Ukraine, like some people might think, and he’s moved a long way in his posture. And I think we’re going to see much more aggressive action in the weeks and months ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ruddy conceded that Trump was not in favour of sending US troops into action.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think the president is highly reluctant to put troops on the ground. That’s nothing to do with Ukraine. He just doesn’t like American troops put in harm’s way. He doesn’t like physical engagements. He’ll do these kinetic strikes from time to time, you saw that in Iran, but it’s still not really deploying American troops and putting them in a lot of risk.</p> </blockquote> <p>Instead, Trump sees this as “an economic battle”, Ruddy said.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>He’s been pushing for [lower oil prices]. He wants sanctions. He wants Nato countries to stop buying Russian oil. So he sees this in economic war, as a businessman.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about Trump’s views on Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, Ruddy said Trump viewed him as “a bad guy, even though he won’t say that publicly”.</p> <p>Trump thought it was worth trying to win Putin round, Ruddy said. But Trump has now decided that’s “not going to work”, Ruddy claimed.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Putin hasn’t talked to anyone.

He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Of course it’s great there’s investment in the UK, and it’s better still that a young, London-based company like Nscale is involved.</p> <p>But these really are crumbs from the Silicon Valley table.</p> <p>If you consider that the total compute capacity in the UK is estimated to be around 1.8 gigawatts, withI’ve read ambitions to reach six gigawatts by 2030. Well, that is about the same as one single data centre being built by my former employer Meta in Louisiana.</p> <p>And so I just think some sort of perspective needs to be applied to all the hype that comes from the government and the tech companies at times like this, especially when we are never going to compete with the Chinese and America on infrastructure. We’re never going to develop our own frontier foundation models – the base layer of the AI industry.</p> <p>Where we can complete is how you deploy AI in the workplace innovatively through new applications and so on.</p> <p>And, crucially, none of this does anything to deal with our perennial Achilles heel in technology in the United Kingdom, which is we’re a very innovative place, with great entrepreneurs, scientists, people who create new companies. But the moment those companies start developing any momentum, they have to go to Palo Alto, to the VC [venture capital] firms there to get money. They then say, well, you’ve got to move to the West Coast if you’re going to take our money.</p> <p>So not only do we import all their technology, we export all our good people and good ideas as well.</p> <p>And that’s why I just think it’s worth keeping some of the hyperbole at moments like this in context.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clegg said everyone in the UK was using phones designed in America, run with US software and US operating systems, with the data stored on American cloud infrastructure</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I sometimes wonder how we would react as a body politic if all that infrastructure, all of that technology that we depend on for every sort of minute detail of our lives, were produced by the French.

It’s day two of the state visit and, after the pomp, today we’re on to the policy. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is leaving Windsor Castle and heading for Chequers where he will have private talks with Keir Starmer before the two leaders hold a press conference.</p> <p>In his speech at the state banquet last night, Trump used some uncharacteristically sophisticated and lovely similes to describe the US/UK relationship. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We’re joined by history and faith, by love and language and by transcendent ties of culture, tradition, ancestry and destiny.</p> <p>We’re like two notes in one chord or two verses of the same poem, each beautiful on its own, but really meant to be played together.</p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer defends his use of flattery diplomacy with Trump on the grounds that it delivers for Britain and, with No 10 announcing US investments in the UK worth £150bn there is evidence to suggest it’s working.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/keir-starmer-150bn-investment-critics-donald-trump-state-visit">Starmer banks on £150bn investment to placate critics of Trump state visit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, to return to Trump’s analogy, there are others who suspect that, if anything is being “played” in all of this, it’s us.</p> <p>On the Today programme this morning <strong>Nick Clegg</strong> came close to expressing this view. As a former Lib Dem deputy prime minister in the 2010-15 coalition government, and a former president of global affairs at Meta, he is very well placed to comment on the relationship. Clegg told Today that the AI investments being anounced for the UK were “crumbs from the Silicon Valley table”. He said he thought the UK had become over-dependent on American technology. And he went on:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Because of the very close partnership we’ve had with the United States, understandably so in the cold war period, I think we’ve been quite relaxed about this very heavy dependency … both in the public and the private sector, on American technology.</p> <p>I just so happen to believe that is now changing because the rupture – notwithstanding the pomp and ceremony of the state visit by Donald Trump this week – the transatlantic rupture, in my view, is real.</p> <p>I think the Americans – and we’ve been on notice for this for ages – are turning their attention to the Pacific. They have much less attachment to the transatlantic relationship.</p> <p>So my view is, over time, British governments need to learn to ask themselves different questions to how we can roll out the red carpet to American investment, welcome as that is. We need to ask ourselves questions about how we can develop and grow … our own technology companies to the size the need to be.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clegg said the UK faced “a huge dilemma”.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We’ve got to learn, technologically, as much as in so many other walks of life, to stand more on own two feet, rather than just cling on to Uncle Sam’s coattails.</p> <p>While that served us well for a while, I think that’s no longer going to be the paradigm that works for us going forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>Today I will be focusing mostly on the Trump visit, although I will cover some other UK politics too. Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Donald Trump leaves Windsor Castle</p> <p><em>Morning:</em> Melania Trump and Queen Camilla visit Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House in Windsor and Frogmore Gardens</p> <p><em>10.45am:</em> Trump is due to arrive at Chequers, where he will hold bilateral talks with Keir Starmer. The two leaders are also speaking at an event for business leaders, and viewing items from the Winston Churchill archive at the mansion, the official country residence of the PM. And there will be a parachute display by the Red Devils.</p> <p><em>Around 2.30pm:</em> Starmer and Trump hold a press conference at Chequers.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm BST at the moment), or message me on social media.
