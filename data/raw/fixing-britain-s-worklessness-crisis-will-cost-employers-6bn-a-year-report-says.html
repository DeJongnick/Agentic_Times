<p>Employers have been told in a landmark government review that fixing Britain’s health-related worklessness crisis will require them to spend £6bn a year on support for their staff.</p> <p>In a major report before this month’s budget, Charlie Mayfield warned that businesses needed to play a more central role in tackling a rising tide of ill-health that is pushing millions of people out of work.</p> <p>The former chair of John Lewis, who was appointed by ministers to lead the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ex-high-street-chief-to-keep-britain-working-with-review-into-business-support-for-disabled-and-long-term-sick">Keep Britain Working</a> review last year, said that a drastic expansion in occupational health was needed to help prevent hundreds of thousands of people from falling out of the workforce each year.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/02/young-people-job-training-jobless-britain-problem"> A million young people aren’t in a job or training. Britain has a problem | Richard Partington</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We need to fix this,” Mayfield told the Guardian. “What we are proposing is a fundamental reset in terms of how health is handled in the workplace. We’re saying we have to move from [a] situation where, for most people, health is for the individual and NHS – we have to move from that position to one where health becomes a true partnership between employers, employees and the health services generally.</p> <p>“That is not a small move, but a big move, and a fundamental shift.”</p> <p>Ministers have grown increasingly alarmed over a dramatic rise in the number of working-age adults falling out of the workforce due to health conditions over recent years, with young adults fuelling much of the increase.</p> <p>As many as one in five working-age adults – more than 9 million in total – are now in a position termed by statisticians as “<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/economicinactivity">economically inactive</a>”, where they are neither in a job nor looking for one. For almost 3 million, the main reason is long-term sickness – the highest level on record.</p> <p>In his highly anticipated report, Mayfield said the overall cost to the UK economy from this “quiet but urgent crisis” was as much as £85bn a year, in a financial blow for the exchequer, businesses and individuals.</p>  <p>Ministers have been focused on cutting a sharp increase in the cost of providing health-related welfare support. The report said the cost from economic inactivity due to ill-health was “unsustainable” for the state, through lost output, increased spending on welfare, and additional burdens on the NHS.</p> <p>However, the focus of Mayfield’s report is to tackle the rise in costs by helping individuals to stay in a job with help from a drastically improved system of workplace support.</p> <p>He said a new approach to health at work was required whereby the responsibility was shared between employers, employees and the government to help slash rates of sickness absence, improve return-to-work rates, and drive up the disability employment rate.</p> <p>The report found a potential benefit of up to £18bn a year for the economy and exchequer if the recommendations were applied across the workforce.</p> <p>The government said more than 60 employers – including household names like British Airways, Nando’s and Tesco – would take on Mayfield’s recommendations in a vanguard programme over the next three years.</p> <p>It said the scheme, which also involves regional mayors and dozens of small businesses from across the country, would act as early adopters to develop stronger approaches to workplace health.</p> <p>Asking businesses to take on a more proactive approach could however prove contentious at a time when business groups have sounded the alarm that Labour’s tax changes and employment policies have made it tougher to hire staff.</p> <p>Bosses have warned the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, against hitting firms with tax increases in her 26 November budget after her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/01/ministers-urged-to-protect-gp-practices-charities-and-care-homes-from-nic-rise">£25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions</a> (NICs) last year.</p> <p>Mayfield acknowledged businesses were facing a tough environment, but said companies could see the benefits from investing in employee health and that growing provisions further was a “win-win” for firms and the economy at large.</p> <p>“Employers must be in the lead. Some may resist that message amid tight margins and slow growth. But many already recognise they are carrying the cost of ill-health every day,” he said.</p> <p>His report recommended firms were likely to face a cost of £5-15 per employee per month to provide improved levels of occupational health – at an annual cost of about £6bn when spread across the economy at large.</p> <p>For some firms, this would mark a sharp rise in spending. However, others, particularly larger employers, already spend significant sums on workplace health.</p> <p>Over time, Mayfield said he envisaged the workplace health schemes provided by employers becoming certified by the government, being integrated with the NHS app and reducing – or even replacing – the need for fit notes issued by healthcare professionals.</p> <p>Among other recommendations, Mayfield’s review also called on ministers to consider incentivising businesses to invest in workplace health through tax cuts and rebates for paying sick pay to employees.</p>
