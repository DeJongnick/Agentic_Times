the £3 bus fare cap, fund Free School Meals for over half a million more children, press ahead with plans to deliver free breakfast clubs for every child in the country and increase the National Minimum and National Living Wage, giving a pay rise to 3 million workers.</p> <p>“There’s more to do, that’s why in the Spending Review we boosted investment and jobs, through better city region

the jump in activity earlier this year, ahead of Donald Trump’s new tariffs.</p> <p>The drop in activity puts more pressure on the Bank of England to lower interest rates, some experts suggested.</p>

Although the UK has struck a trade deal with the US, much of the detail is yet to be sorted out. Meanwhile, the delayed deadline for other countries has only prolonged uncertainties that have impacted UK growth. </p> <p>“April’s GDP reversal provided clear evidence that there has not been a sustained improvement in economic activity, reinforced by yet another downbeat month which leaves the economy on track for a shallow contraction once June’s data sees the end of Q2. </p> <p>“The Labour government will be hoping that the UK economy might generate momentum over the second half of the year, perhaps supported by further rate cuts from the Bank of England. However, this hopeful outturn remains uncertain, with growing fears that taxes might be increased again at the Autumn Budget. All hints suggest that the UK economy will suffer a very downbeat year in 2025, before staging a partial improvement in 2026.” </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Hailey Low,</strong> associate economist at the <strong>National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), </strong>fears growth propects are ‘muted’:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Today’s growth figure of -0.1 per cent in May following April’s contraction indicates that the UK’s economic outlook remains fragile. Failure to implement the planned spending cuts has further eroded the UK’s fiscal space and it’s ability to respond to future shocks. Combined with depressed hiring intentions and strained public finances, growth prospects remain muted in the medium term. </p> <p>With fiscal space increasingly constrained, the Chancellor faces hard trade-offs this autumn budget, having to raise taxes or cut spending to meet her self imposed rules.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul</strong> <strong>Dales</strong>, chief UK economist at <strong>Capital</strong> <strong>Economics</strong>, predicts growth will slow sharply this quarter:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If GDP were flat in June, then the 0.7% q/q gain in Q1 would be followed by a 0.1% q/q rise in Q2 as a whole (BoE forecast +0.25%). The underlying pace of growth is somewhere in between.</p> <p>We think GDP will rise by a fairly subdued 1.0% this year due to the lingering drags from a weakening global economy and the rises in domestic taxes for UK businesses.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6870ac168f08ed9c6fb4c220" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-11T06:23:19.723Z">7.23am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Manufacturing output fell, led by pharma and cars</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Digging into the GDP report, we can see that UK manufacturing output fell by 1.0% in May 2025, following a 0.7% fall in April 2025.</strong></p> <p>Manufacturing was the largest contributor to the overall decrease in production output in May 2025, with 9 of the 13 subsectors declining, the <strong>Office</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>National</strong> <strong>Statistics</strong> reports.</p> <p>There was a 4.2% drop in the manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations, following growth of 5.4% in April 2025.
