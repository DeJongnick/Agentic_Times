<p>To non-vegans, the idea of a plant-based Christmas dinner may smack of Scrooge crouched over a miserly candle, sucking on a single slice of tofu. There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what’s left?<br></p> <p>Actually, this year there’s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it’s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the “flexitarian” means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it’s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there’s now a gluttonous array of choice.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>The majority of a traditional roast is vegan anyway</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made – use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness).</p> <p>When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you’re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable <a href="http://lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/our-food/frozen-range/vegetarian-beef-roast-with-red-wine-shallot-glaze/">Linda McCartney range’s new “roast beef” joint</a> comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some.</p>    <p>Fry’s soy and quinoa <a href="http://www.fryfamilyfood.com/uk/soy-quinoa-country-roast/">Country Roast</a> is a solid herby veggie roast, while <a href="http://www.tofurky.com/what-we-make/holiday/feast/">Tofurky’s turkey and stuffing</a> is a respectable substitute for the real thing. At the more artisan end of the faux butchers – there’s an emerging meat-substitute industry that reminds me of the craft brewery explosion – then Irish company Moodley Manor offers top-end luxury in its mammoth <a href="https://soulbia.com/products/moodley-manor-roast-1kg">meat-free roast</a>, with a sausage and breadcrumb stuffing inside that tastes like the real deal, while Scotland’s Sgaia Meats is serving up a new and limited version of their signature “<a href="https://www.sgaiafoods.co.uk/collections/hearty-plant-based-meats">mheat</a>” vegan roast wrapped in maple-glazed rashers and filled with orange, hazelnut and pancetta stuffing.</p> <p>If you’re a no-meat-substitutes kind of vegan, the hardy nut roast is a perennial stand-in and most major supermarkets have a vegetable-based centrepiece, if you don’t fancy making your own. Ocado has a stuffed butternut squash made by Irish company Dee’s, while Tesco is pushing the boat out with <a href="http://go.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fgroceries%2Fen-GB%2Fproducts%2F298404245&amp;id=114047X1572903">cauliflower wellington</a>.</p> <p>But the real joy of Christmas is in the trimmings, otherwise it would just be an ordinary Sunday. You can make bread sauce with a non-dairy milk, though most are likely to be too sweet – unsweetened almond milk is a good bet. For pig-free pigs in blankets, pick a fakon (fake bacon) and a brand of vegan mini sausage, and make up your own (I’d go for <a href="https://www.moodleymanor.com/">Moodley Manor</a>’s bacon on <a href="http://lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/">Linda McCartney</a>’s cocktail sausages). Ocado stocks <a href="https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Dees-Vegan-Sausage-Stuffing-Pot/382212011">Dee’s vegan sausage stuffing</a>; while on the sauce front, most cranberry sauces will be vegan, and for the fancier meat-avoider in your life, there’s also <a href="http://www.tidefordorganics.com/range/product/vegan-gravy-with-red-miso/">Tideford organic vegan gravy with red miso</a>.</p> <p>It’s surprisingly easy to avoid a fruit platter at dessert time, too. Asda’s own-brand mince pies are vegan, as are Waitrose Essential mince pies, and today dairy-free ice creams are available in most supermarkets. Or, if you’re the kind of person who pours cold Bailey’s on a steaming mince pie, then there’s even a vegan version of that – slosh on the gluggable <a href="http://www.baileys.com/en-us/flavors/baileys-almande.html">Baileys Almande</a>, available in Whole Foods, while sipping M&amp;S’s <a href="http://go.theguardian.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marksandspencer.com%2Fgold-crme-brulee-liqueur-case-of-6%2Fp%2Fp60093630%3FOmnitureRedirect%3Dgold%2Bcreme%2Bbrulee&amp;id=114047X1572903">Gold Crème Brûlée Liqueur</a>.</p>    <p>For the determined and brave, if not foolhardy, it’s even possible to cook up a vegan cheese platter. <a href="https://violifefoods.com/">Violife</a> and <a href="https://www.vbitesfoods.com/">VBites</a> offer a variety of “cheeses”, though for this particular customer they’re a substitute too far. If you’re really determined, I’d go for a simple homemade cashew cheese using online recipes, which makes a good soft cheese for crackers. You can whip up an easy mushroom pâté at home, or Ocado does a <a href="https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/VBites-Duck-Style--Orange-Pate/385486011">VBites duck pâté</a> if you’re more effort-free.</p> <p>So whether you’re the sole vegan at a meat feast or serving up a meat-free dinner for non-subscribers, step away from the stuffed red pepper: at last, food producers, from independent businesses to big supermarket chains, have made it possible for everyone to pig out this Christmas. As long as those pigs are creative plant-based versions of the real thing, of course.</p> <p><em><sup>This article contains <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links">affiliate links</a> to products.
