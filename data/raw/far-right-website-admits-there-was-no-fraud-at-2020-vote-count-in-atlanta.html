<p>The far-right website the Gateway Pundit acknowledged for the first time on Saturday that there had not been any fraud during ballot counting in Atlanta in 2020 when Donald Trump lost the presidency, a significant concession from one of the most influential conservative sites that plays a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/03/gateway-pundit-conservative-news-election-fraud/">key role in spreading election misinformation</a>.</p> <p>The statement, the first acknowledgment from the site that there was no proof of fraud in Atlanta, came days after the site <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/gateway-pundit-defamation-lawsuit-election-workers">settled a defamation lawsuit</a> with Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, two local election workers whom the site falsely accused of wrongdoing. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed publicly, but the site appears to have removed all mention of the two women.</p> <p>“Georgia officials concluded that there was no widespread voter fraud by election workers who counted ballots at the State Farm Arena in November 2020,” the site’s co-founder, Jim Hoft, <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2024/10/note-editor-legal-update/">said in a statement</a> posted on Gateway Pundit on Saturday. “The results of this investigation indicate that Ruby Freeman and Wandrea ‘Shaye’ Moss did not engage in ballot fraud or criminal misconduct while working at State Farm Arena on election night. A legal matter with this news organization and the two election workers has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties through a fair and reasonable settlement.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/gateway-pundit-defamation-lawsuit-election-workers">Far-right site Gateway Pundit settles defamation suit with election workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Trump sought to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat to Joe Biden, Gateway Pundit relentlessly amplified a misleading video it said showed poll workers fraudulently counting ballots on election night. Gateway Pundit was the first site to identify Freeman and Moss as the two women in the video and published dozens of articles falsely accusing them of wrongdoing.</p> <p>Moss and Freeman have publicly spoken out about the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/13/rudy-giuliani-defamation-trial-georgia-third-day"> severe harassment</a> they faced. They received many death threats. People showed up unannounced at Freeman’s home, and she feared they were going to kill her. Both women testified last year that they were still afraid to go out alone in public.</p> <p>Hoft and his twin brother, Joe, who is also a contributor to the site, refused to back down from their false claims. They <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/19/election-denialism-republican-convention">held a press conference </a>on the sidelines of the Republican national convention in Milwaukee in July insisting that the video showed wrongdoing.</p> <p>Freeman and Moss previously settled a lawsuit with One America News Network, another far-right conservative outlet, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-america-news-walks-back-voter-fraud-claims-as-part-of-defamation-settlement-11652212946">which subsequently broadcast</a> a correction to its reporting and noted the two women had not engaged in fraud.</p> <p>A Washington DC jury also ordered Trump ally Rudy Giuliani to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/15/rudy-giuliani-pay-damages-election-workers-defamation-trial">pay the two women nearly</a> $150m in damages last year. Giuliani has appealed the verdict and undertaken legal maneuvers to avoid payment. Lawyers for Freeman and Moss have asked a federal judge in New York to give them control over his assets.</p> <p>Gateway Pundit still faces a defamation lawsuit from Eric Coomer, a former employee of Dominion voting systems, whom the outlet falsely accused of rigging the election.</p>
