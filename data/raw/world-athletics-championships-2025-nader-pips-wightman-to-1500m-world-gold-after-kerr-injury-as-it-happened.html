  <p><strong>Jake Wightman speaks</strong> after winning silver in the men’s 1500m: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I felt like I still had something in me. All I knew today was I was going to run to try to win and whether that got me the win, whether that got me second, third, however high up, I would have just been happy I walked away with it. </p> 
   <p>But when you come that close to winning you can’t help but be like: ‘Oh, but if I tried a bit more’, but I left everything out there. </p> 
   <p>Honestly it has been a very bleak couple of years for me. I think a lot of times I doubted myself even getting back to this level so for me making this team was the main thing. I made some huge changes in my life this past year to try to get back to this point. It’s not just affect me, my fiancee, we relocated from London, which was our home for eight years, to Manchester to be close to therapy. </p> 
   <p>I got a new coach and a new coaching setup because I felt that is what I needed at this point. Big changes that had a big impact on me and I hoped it was for the best. It took a while to believe those were the right decisions. </p> 
   <p>I believe that you get what you pay for in the end. I am so happy that all the persistence has been worth it. </p> 
   <p>I felt like I had another gear all these Championships but I did not know what would happen. This silver is a gold for me and I am so relieved. </p>
