<p>In what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> officials dubbed a “major announcement”, health and agriculture department leaders said the US dairy industry agreed to voluntarily remove synthetic dyes from ice-cream.</p> <p>The announcement continues the Trump administration’s pattern of voluntary agreements with industry – from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/rfk-jr-dr-oz-prior-authorization-health-insurance">health insurers</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/rfk-jr-dr-oz-prior-authorization-health-insurance">snack food makers</a>.</p> <p>“This is relevant to my favorite food, which is ice-cream,” said the US health secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>.</p> <p>“Since we came in about five and a half months ago and started talking about eliminating dyes and other bad chemicals from our food, we’ve had this extraordinary response from our industry.”</p> <p>Representatives of the dairy industry said that more than 40 ice-cream companies agreed not to use synthetic dyes. Kennedy also alluded to the future release of new dietary guidelines, which would “elevate” dairy products, including full-fat dairy, to “where they ought to be in terms of contributing to the health of our children”.</p> <p>The head of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Dr Marty Makary, also announced that his agency approved a new plant-based dye: “gardenia blue”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/09/rfk-ultra-processed-food-medicaid">Kennedy touts ultra-processed meals he once called ‘poison’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The value of full-fat dairy is an ongoing <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/20/whole-milk-in-schools-maha-movement-on-verge-of-40-year-change/?utm_campaign=morning_rounds&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8I_flBp7O7jug9g6AK_vY1lkhUjN4w7QW5-KQanMiLK_HWti700lutI4mIeGtKBinTnohBdK-VtZI_3L27-0fF_zgSDghjyl1X3n22Dl9XTwrBQ4o&amp;_hsmi=367661459&amp;utm_content=367661459&amp;utm_source=hs_email">subject of debate</a> in nutrition research circles. For decades, government health authorities have cautioned against too much saturated fats, sugars and refined grains because of their link to obesity and heart disease. Some high-profile researchers now argue that full-fat dairy may not be as harmful as once thought.</p> <p>That is a perspective shared by the US dairy industry, which has <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/20/whole-milk-in-schools-maha-movement-on-verge-of-40-year-change/?utm_campaign=morning_rounds&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8I_flBp7O7jug9g6AK_vY1lkhUjN4w7QW5-KQanMiLK_HWti700lutI4mIeGtKBinTnohBdK-VtZI_3L27-0fF_zgSDghjyl1X3n22Dl9XTwrBQ4o&amp;_hsmi=367661459&amp;utm_content=367661459&amp;utm_source=hs_email">funded nutrition research</a> and fought against government controls on dairy in school lunches since the Obama administration.</p> <p>The issue is also important in rural communities across dairy country, where farmers began displaying hand-painted <a href="https://www.farmprogress.com/commentary/farmers-you-can-make-a-difference">hay bales</a> outside farms with messages such as: “Drink whole milk 97% fat free.”</p> <p>The Trump administration has held a close relationship with the dairy industry for years, stretching all the way back to the president’s first term. In 2019, then agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/03/revealed-dairy-lobby-fat-milk-trump-sonny-perdue">toasted dairy lobbyists</a> with a glass of chocolate milk to celebrate the reintroduction of once-banned flavored milks back into schools.</p> <p>“This is a great day for dairy and a great day for ‘make America healthy again,’” said Michael Dykes, the president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association. “We’re so happy with the voluntary industry-led commitment.”</p> <p>Notably, the Trump administration’s effort to reach voluntary agreements with industry has also shown the strategy’s limits. For instance, Mars, the maker of Skittles and M&amp;M’s, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/11/trump-kennedy-candy-controversy/84505034007/">resisted Kennedy’s efforts</a>. Meanwhile, on health insurance, experts have expressed skepticism that an agreement with private insurers will significantly help Americans.</p>
