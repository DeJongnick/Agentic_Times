Hours later, Israel’s defense minister Israel Katz said he told his US counterpart Pete Hegseth that “Israel will respect the ceasefire — as long as the other side does”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>An initial classified US assessment of Donald Trump’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities over the weekend says they did not destroy two of the sites and</strong> <strong>likely only set back the nuclear program by a few months</strong>, according to two people familiar with the report. The report produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency – the intelligence arm of the Pentagon – concluded key components of the nuclear program, including centrifuges, were capable of being restarted within months. The report also found that much of Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium that could be put to use for a possible nuclear weapon was moved before the strikes and may have been moved to other secret nuclear sites maintained by Iran. The findings suggest<strong> </strong>Trump’s declaration about the sites being “obliterated” may be overstated.

   <li><p><strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> <strong>said Israel would strike again if Iran rebuilds its nuclear project</strong>. Describing his war on Iran as a “historic victory” that “will stand for generations”, the Israeli PM claimed that Israel in its 12 days of war with Iran had removed “the threat of nuclear annihilation”. He said on he had “no intention of easing off the gas pedal” and Israel “must complete” its campaign against the Iranian axis, to defeat Hamas and to bring about the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s startling outburst at Iran and Israel capped a drama-filled 24 hours for Trump, the US, the Middle East and the world. As both sides defied his ceasefire, the US president lashed out, his anger and frustration clearly visible as he swore on live television.</p> 
  <p>Trump later called Israel’s prime minister to demand he stop bombing Iran.</p> 
  <p>With the fragile ceasefire seeming to hold, there was some unwelcome news via a report from the Pentagon which said the US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities were not quite as successful as Trump had claimed.</p>

  <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong>’s AI chatbot <strong>Grok</strong> produced inaccurate and contradictory responses when users sought to fact-check the Israel-Iran conflict, a study has said, raising fresh doubts about its reliability as a debunking tool.</p> 
  <p>Agence France-Presse reports that with tech platforms reducing their reliance on human fact-checkers, users are increasingly utilising AI-powered chatbots – including xAI’s Grok – in search of reliable information, but their responses are often prone to misinformation.</p> 
  <p>“The investigation into Grok’s performance during the first days of the Israel-Iran conflict exposes significant flaws and limitations in the AI chatbot’s ability to provide accurate, reliable and consistent information during times of crisis,” said the study from the digital forensic research lab (DFRLab) of the <strong>Atlantic Council</strong>, an American thinktank.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Grok demonstrated that it struggles with verifying already-confirmed facts, analysing fake visuals and avoiding unsubstantiated claims.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The DFRLab analysed about 130,000 posts in various languages on the platform X, where the AI assistant is built in, to find that Grok was “struggling to authenticate AI-generated media”.</p> 
  <p>Following Iran’s retaliatory strikes on Israel, Grok offered vastly different responses to similar prompts about an AI-generated video of a destroyed airport that amassed millions of views on X, the study found. It oscillated – sometimes within the same minute – between denying the airport’s destruction and confirming it had been damaged by strikes, the study said.</p> 
  <p>In some responses, Grok cited the a missile launched by Yemeni rebels as the source of the damage. In others, it wrongly identified the AI-generated airport as one in Beirut, Gaza or Tehran.</p>

  <p>Israelis have responded calmly to <strong>Donald Trump’</strong>s criticisms and accusations their country had violated a truce he brokered with Iran, expressing gratitude for his mediation and relief at the conclusion of the 12-day war.</p> 
  <p>Reuters reports that earlier on Tuesday the US president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/24/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire-netanyahu">admonished Israel</a> after waking in Washington to find the ceasefire had been violated by both sides, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/24/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire-netanyahu">telling the media</a>: “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing.”</p> 
  <p>In Haifa, northern Israel, <strong>Daniel Kopylkov</strong>, a 27-year-old cook, said: “Honestly, I don’t care that much about what Trump said about Israel. At the end of the day, I think he’s the one that truly helped to bring an end to this war and that’s what’s important to me.”</p> 
  <p>Kopylkov was one of several people Reuters interviewed in Haifa, a target of Iranian missiles during the conflict. It is Israel’s third-largest city after Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and home to Israel’s busiest seaport and a naval base.</p> 
  <p>Historian <strong>Marc Volovici</strong>, 42, said Trump’s outburst underscored Israel’s dependence on US political, military and financial support.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This was just a very small but significant demonstration of how Israel relies on international legitimacy, and especially [the] American one.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>A 70-year-old resident identifying herself only as <strong>Esther</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s like a parent scolding the child. He’s scolding us. But it’s not anything dramatically serious. I’m not a politician, you know, I’m just feeling it like that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Lawyer <strong>Ephraim Glazberg</strong>, 75, expressed a similar view, saying: “I think it was the agony of the moment. I don’t think this is a problem.”</p>

  <p>Oil prices sank for a second straight day and stock markets mostly rose on Tuesday as the ceasefire between Iran and Israel appeared to be holding.</p> 
  <p>Crude futures slumped in volatile trading after <strong>Donald Trump</strong> announced a ceasefire, extending Monday’s steep losses in oil after Iran’s response to the US attack did not hit energy infrastructure, Agence France-Presse reports.</p> 
  <p>“This morning’s ceasefire further reduced the perceived threat to Middle Eastern oil supply routes,” said <strong>David Morrison</strong>, analyst at Trade Nation.</p> 
  <p>The main international and US oil contracts briefly bounced off their lows as Israel and Iran accused each other of breaking the ceasefire, but then resumed their fall after Trump berated the two countries.</p>

  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> has said China can continue to purchase Iranian oil after Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire, a move the White House clarified did not indicate a relaxation of US sanctions.</p> 
  <p>“China can now continue to purchase Oil from Iran. Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the U.S., also,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, just days after ordering the US bombings of three Iranian nuclear sites.</p> 
  <p>Reuters cited a senior White House official as saying the US president was drawing attention to no attempts by Iran so far to close the Strait of Hormuz to oil tankers, as a closure would have been hard for China, the world’s top importer of Iranian oil.</p> 
  <p>“The president continues to call on China and all countries to import our state-of-the-art oil rather than import Iranian oil in violation of US sanctions,” the official said.</p> 
  <p>After the ceasefire announcement, Trump’s comments on China were another bearish signal for oil prices, which fell nearly 6%.</p> 
  <p>Any relaxation of sanctions enforcement on Iran would mark a US policy shift after Trump said in February he was reimposing maximum pressure on Iran, aiming to drive its oil exports to zero, over its nuclear program and funding of militants across the Middle East.</p> 
  <p>“President Trump’s greenlight for China to keep buying Iranian oil reflects a return to lax enforcement standards,” said <strong>Scott Modell</strong>, a former CIA officer, now CEO of Rapidan Energy Group.</p>

  <p>At the United Nations, France and its European partners are still prepared to reactivate sanctions on Iran if an agreement is not reached soon on its nuclear program, the French ambassador to the UN has warned.</p> 
  <p>“Time is running out,” <strong>Jerome Bonnnafont</strong> said at a UN security council meeting in reference to the October expiration of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We expect Iran to return to talks without delay in order to achieve a robust, verifiable and lasting diplomatic solution.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Agence France-Presse reports Bonnafont also said on Tuesday said negotiations were the only way to “guarantee the impossibility of an Iranian military nuclear program”, days after the US conducted strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities. He told the New York meeting:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>France and its E3 partners [Germany and the UK] remain ready to use the leverage established by resolution 2231, that of a ‘snapback’ [of sanctions], if a satisfactory agreement is not reached by summer.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>UK ambassador <strong>Barbara Wood</strong> concurred, saying: “We will use all diplomatic levers at our disposal to support a negotiated outcome and ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump's strikes on Iran only set back nuclear program by months, early intelligence finds</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>An initial classified <strong>US</strong> assessment of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s strikes on <strong>Iran’s</strong> nuclear facilities over the weekend says they did not destroy two of the sites and <strong>likely only set back the nuclear program by a few months</strong>, according to two people familiar with the report.</p> 
  <p>The report produced by the <strong>Defense Intelligence Agency</strong> – the intelligence arm of the <strong>Pentagon</strong> – and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/24/israel-iran-war-live-updates-trump-declares-ceasefire-tehran-attack-us-base-qatar?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-685af89f8f08cff83135b21a#block-685af89f8f08cff83135b21a">first reported by CNN</a>, concluded key components of the nuclear program including centrifuges and enriched uranium were capable of being restarted within months.</p> 
  <p>The report also found that much of <strong>Iran’s</strong> stockpile of highly enriched uranium that could be put to use for a possible nuclear weapon was moved before the strikes and may have been moved to other secret nuclear sites maintained by <strong>Iran</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The findings by the DIA, which were based on a preliminary battle damage assessment conducted by <strong>US</strong> central command, which oversees <strong>US</strong> military operations in the Middle East<strong>, suggests Trump’s declaration about the sites being “obliterated” may be overstated</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Trump</strong> had said in his <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2025/jun/21/trump-further-attacks-iran">televised address on Saturday night</a> immediately after the operation that the <strong>US</strong> had completely destroyed Iran’s enrichment sites at <strong>Natanz</strong> and <strong>Fordow</strong>, the facility buried deep underground, and at <strong>Esfahan</strong>, where enrichment was being stored.</p> 
  <p>“The strikes were a spectacular military success. <strong>Iran’s</strong> key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” <strong>Trump</strong> said in his address from the White House.</p> 
  <p>While the <strong>DIA</strong> report was only an initial assessment, one of the people said if the intelligence on the ground was already finding within days that <strong>Fordow</strong> in particular was not destroyed, later assessments could suggest even less damage might have been inflicted.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Netanyahu declares 'historic victory' and claims Israel removed Iran's nuclear threat in 12-day war</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> has said that <strong>Israel</strong> in its 12 days of war with <strong>Iran</strong> had removed “the threat of nuclear annihilation”.</p> 
  <p>“We have removed <strong>two immediate existential threats</strong> to us - the threat of nuclear annihilation and the threat of annihilation by 20,000 ballistic missiles,” the <strong>Israeli</strong> PM claimed in video remarks issued by his office.</p> 
  <p>However, despite this and <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s recent claim that <strong>Iran</strong> was “very close” to making a nuclear weapon when <strong>Israel</strong> launched its bombing campaign, <strong>Mark Warner</strong>, the vice-chairman of the <strong>US</strong> Senate intelligence committee, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jun/18/donald-trump-brad-lander-ice-iran-israel-pakistan-india-fed-jerome-powell-us-politics-live-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6853255b8f0806bcd720d210#block-6853255b8f0806bcd720d210">said last Wednesday</a> that senators were briefed on Monday, after <strong>Israel’s</strong> attack, that <strong>US</strong> intelligence agencies still see no evidence that <strong>Iran</strong> was trying to make nuclear weapons.</p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/katy-tur/watch/sen-warner-says-trump-admin-having-no-plan-for-middle-east-is-irresponsibility-on-steroids-241852997669">an interview with MSNBC</a>, Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said that Trump’s director of national intelligence, <strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong>, had testified to the Senate in March “that Iran had taken no action towards, moving towards a bomb”.</p> 
  <p>“And we got reconfirmed … Monday of this week, that the intelligence hasn’t changed,” Warner added.</p> 
  <p>Back to <strong>Netanyahu</strong> today, describing his war on Iran as a “historic victory” that “will stand for generations”, he went on to say that “no intention of easing off the gas pedal” and <strong>Israel</strong> “must complete” its campaign against <strong>Iran’s</strong> axis, to defeat <strong>Hamas</strong> and to bring about the release of the remaining hostages in <strong>Gaza</strong>.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted">

 <h2 class="block-title">US tells UN its strikes degraded Iran's capacity to build nuclear weapon</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>American</strong> strikes on <strong>Iran’s</strong> nuclear facilities last weekend “effectively fulfilled our narrow objective: to degrade Iran’s capacity to produce a nuclear weapon”, acting US envoy to the UN <strong>Dorothy Shea</strong> told the <strong>United Nations Security Council</strong> on Tuesday.</p> 
  <p>In her statement, Shea claimed the onus was on <strong>Tehran</strong> for not yet reaching a nuclear deal with the <strong>US</strong>, leading to the US carrying out a “precision operation” to strike <strong>Iran’s</strong> nuclear facilities.</p> 
  <p>But as you might remember, two weeks ago <strong>Trump</strong> told <strong>Netanyahu</strong> not to strike Iran as he still hoped to secure a nuclear deal with Tehran, and the US president only sought to associate himself with Israel’s offensive after Netanyahu – keen to divert international attention <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/24/israel-iran-war-live-updates-trump-declares-ceasefire-tehran-attack-us-base-qatar?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-685a6b2f8f081fbad9b338cd#block-685a6b2f8f081fbad9b338cd">away from </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/24/israel-iran-war-live-updates-trump-declares-ceasefire-tehran-attack-us-base-qatar?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-685a6b2f8f081fbad9b338cd#block-685a6b2f8f081fbad9b338cd">Gaza</a></strong> - ignored him and bombed Iran anyway.</p> 
  <p>What is more, while senior administration figures have insisted that the US was solely targeting the nuclear programme and <strong>Shea</strong> stresses that the <strong>American</strong> objective was “narrow”, <strong>Trump</strong> more than once <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/trump-talks-of-regime-change-in-iran-and-insists-us-obliterated-nuclear-sites">mooted “regime change”</a> in Iran before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/24/israel-iran-war-live-updates-trump-declares-ceasefire-tehran-attack-us-base-qatar?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-685a99d38f0879bcde447408#block-685a99d38f0879bcde447408">doubling back today</a>.</p> 
  <p>The strikes, <strong>Shea</strong> went on to claim, “were in accordance with the inherent right to collective self-defense, consistent with the UN charter, [and] aimed to mitigate the threat posed by Iran to Israel, the region, and more broadly to international peace and security”.</p> 
  <p>But as professor of international relations at the London School of Economics Fawaz Gerges <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/20/middle-east-trump-stopped-war-uk-us-iraq">wrote for us on Friday</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Israel’s war on Iran is <strong>neither legal nor just</strong> … Even if Iran was making a bomb, <strong>international law doesn’t give Israel and the US the right to bomb Iran</strong>. The UN charter is clear on the use of force in international relations.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Following the <strong>Trump</strong>-brokered ceasefire, Shea said of <strong>Iran</strong> (and not <strong>Israel</strong>, as Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/24/israel-iran-war-live-updates-trump-declares-ceasefire-tehran-attack-us-base-qatar?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-685a91a78f087d712b381af9#block-685a91a78f087d712b381af9">did earlier today</a>):</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Early US intel assessment suggests strikes on Iran did not destroy nuclear sites - CNN</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>An early <strong>US</strong> intelligence assessment indicated that the US military strikes on three of <strong>Iran’s</strong> nuclear facilities last week did not destroy the core components of Tehran’s nuclear program and <strong>likely only set it back by months</strong>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/politics/intel-assessment-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-sites">CNN reports</a>, citing three people briefed on the matter.</p> 
  <p>The assessment, which has not been previously reported, was produced by the <strong>Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)</strong>, the <strong>Pentagon’s</strong> intelligence arm, and is based on a battle damage assessment conducted by <strong>US Central Command</strong> in the aftermath of the US strikes, one of the sources <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/politics/intel-assessment-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-sites">told CNN</a>.</p> 
  <p>The analysis of the damage to the sites and the impact of the strikes on <strong>Iran’s</strong> nuclear ambitions is ongoing, and could change as further intelligence becomes available.</p> 
  <p>But the early findings are at odds with <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s repeated claims that the strikes “completely and totally obliterated” <strong>Iran’s</strong> nuclear enrichment facilities, and US defense secretary <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>’s comments claiming that <strong>Iran’s</strong> nuclear ambitions “have been obliterated”. </p> 
  <p>They’re also at odds with comments I reported <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/24/israel-iran-war-live-updates-trump-declares-ceasefire-tehran-attack-us-base-qatar?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-685af7b98f08baa326f708ec#block-685af7b98f08baa326f708ec">just moments ago</a> from <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> that Iran’s nuclear project had been “dismantled” and declaring a “historic victory”. </p> 
  <p>Two of the people familiar with the assessment said Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium was not destroyed. One of the people said the centrifuges are largely “intact”.</p> 
  <p>“So the [DIA] assessment is that the US set them back maybe a few months, tops,” one of the sources <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/politics/intel-assessment-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-sites">told CNN</a>.</p> 
  <p>The White House acknowledged the existence of the assessment but said they disagreed with it. “This alleged assessment is flat-out wrong,” CNN quoted White House press secretary <strong>Karoline Leavitt</strong> as saying.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary of the day so far</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>It has been an eventful few hours in the Middle East, with both sides of the Iran-Israel conflict accusing the other of breaching the ceasefire agreement brokered by the US.</strong></p> 
  <p>Below is a summary of the latest events that have unfolded:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>US president Donald Trump said on Tuesday that both Israel and Iran violated a ceasefire he announced hours earlier and he was not happy with either country but especially Israel. </strong>Speaking to reporters before leaving for the Nato summit in The Hague, Trump said Israel “unloaded” right after agreeing to the deal.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israeli defence minister Israel Katz said he has ordered the country’s military to respond forcefully to what he said was Iran’s violation of a ceasefire with Israel. </strong>The directive followed an announcement by the military that it had detected missile launches from Iran towards Israel 2.5 hours after the start of the ceasefire brokered by US president Donald Trump, which he said came into effect in a post on Truth Social at 06:08 GMT.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Katz’s comments came after the Israeli government confirmed reports that it agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the US, after almost two weeks of direct military conflict with Iran. </strong>The statement noted Israel achieved all of the operation’s objectives, removing “dual immediate existential threat from itself – both in the nuclear and ballistic missile fields”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran denied it launched missiles at Israel in the “last few hours”, after Israel accused it of doing so after US president Donald Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire. </strong>The general staff of the Iranian army “denied the launch of missiles from Iran to the occupied territories (Israel) in the last few hours”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran also accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire. The spokesperson of Iran’s Khatam al-Anbiya central military headquarters said Israel struck Iran in three stages up until 9am local time (05:30 GMT) on Tuesday. </strong>Iranian state TV earlier said a ceasefire would take place in Iran from 7:30am local time on Tuesday, with the country’s armed forces accusing Israel of launching strikes after this time.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The number of people killed by Israeli fire while waiting for aid trucks in central Gaza has risen to 25, according to Palestinian witnesses and hospitals. </strong>The military said it was reviewing reports of casualties from Israeli fire after a group of people approached troops in an area adjunct to the east-west Netzarim corridor, which bisects Gaza.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The UN human rights office said on Tuesday that the “weaponisation” of food for civilians in Gaza constitutes a war crime, in its strongest remarks yet on a new model of aid distribution run by an Israeli-backed organisation. </strong>Thameen Al-Kheetan told reporters at a Geneva press briefing that “desperate, hungry people in Gaza continue to face the inhumane choice of either starving to death or risk being killed while trying to get food”.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Interim summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>It’s been a confusing few hours amid a lack of clarity about the state of a ceasefire announced by US president Trump.</strong></p> 
  <p>If you are just getting up to speed, here is a handy summary of what we know, and don’t know, so far.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>US president Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire">announced</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire"> </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire">in a social media post</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire"> </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire">that Iran and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire</a>. </strong>“On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, “THE 12 DAY WAR,” Trump wrote on his platform, Truth Social. “This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn’t, and never will!” Trump later told NBC the ceasefire was “unlimited” and would last “forever”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump brokered the ceasefire through talks with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday while his team, including vice-president JD Vance, held talks with Tehran</strong>, a senior White House official told Reuters. The official, providing details of the ceasefire on condition of anonymity, said Israel agreed to it so long as Iran does not launch fresh attacks.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>After the ceasefire was announcement by Trump, Israel’s Defence Forces issued an evacuation warning for several parts of the Iranian capital</strong>, ahead of a planned Israeli strike. On social media, some users reported massive explosions in Tehran, which they said was the most intense since Israel first started bombing Iran 12 days ago.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran launched several salvoes of ballistic missiles at Israel early on Tuesday</strong>, with at least one of the missiles directly hitting a residential building in Be’er Sheva, killing three and wounding eight more, emergency services said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The launches came after 4am Tehran time, the time that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said it would end its attacks if Israel stopped its bombings</strong>. Earlier he said that if Israeli strikes ceased Iran had “no intention to continue our response afterwards”. At 4.30am GMT Iranian state media announced that a ceasefire was now in effect.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Qatar’s prime minister reportedly secured Iran’s agreement to the US ceasefire proposal in call with Tehran</strong>, an official briefed on the matter told Reuters.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump’s declaration comes after Iran announced it had</strong> <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/trump-talks-of-regime-change-in-iran-and-insists-us-obliterated-nuclear-sites">launched a missile attack on a US base</a> in the Gulf state of Qatar</strong>, <strong>in what it said was retaliation for US participation in Israel’s bombing campaign against Iran</strong> the day before.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Qatar’s foreign ministry said that “Qatar’s air defences successfully thwarted the attack and intercepted the Iranian missiles” and there had been no casualties.</strong> Iran reportedly provided advance warning of the attack.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump at the weekend launched an</strong> <strong>unprecedented attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, including Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow</strong>. Codenamed ‘midnight Hammer,’ the attack deployed American B-2 bombers, and so-called bunker buster bombs.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump was quick to claim that US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities had “completely and totally obliterated” them</strong>, it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-insists-monumental-damage-done-by-us-strikes-in-iran-but-others-are-more-cautious">remains unclear how much physical damage has been done </a>or what the longer-term impact might be on Iran’s nuclear programme.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>US bombing probably caused “very significant” damage to the underground areas of Iran’s Fordow uranium enrichment plant dug into a mountain, though no one can yet tell the extent, UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Monday.</strong> “Given the explosive payload utilised and the extreme vibration-sensitive nature of centrifuges, very significant damage is expected to have occurred,” Grossi said in a statement.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The comments follow a meeting by the national security committee of Iran’s parliament, which approved the general outline of a bill meant to fully suspend Tehran’s cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog.</strong> According to the bill, installing surveillance cameras, allowing inspections, and submitting reports to the IAEA would be suspended as long as the security of nuclear facilities is not guaranteed.</p></li>

  <p>It wasn’t immediately possible to reconcile the messages from Iran and Israel on the 12th day of their war. <strong>Iranian state television announced the ceasefire in a graphic on screen, not immediately acknowledging the new missile barrage coming after the deadline set by President Donald Trump in his earlier ceasefire announcement.</strong> </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israelis awake to consecutive missile warnings amid Iranian strikes</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>As dawn broke in Israel and Iran, confusion reigned as to whether the two countries were still at war.</strong> <strong>Israelis, who fell asleep to the news that a ceasefire had been agreed to, woke up to four consecutive missile warnings,</strong> heading back and forth to the shelters as a missile hit a residential building in Be’er Sheva, killing three, according to the Israel fire and rescue centre.<br><br>Iran experienced some of its most intense Israeli bombings yet overnight, with one social media users in Tehran writing “the bombardment tonight in Tehran was extremely intense. For a full hour the explosions wouldn’t stop. We are a completely defenseless people.”</p> 
  <p><strong>It was unclear whether the attacks were simply growing pains of a ceasefire, or if hostilities were to continue.</strong> US President Donald Trump had announced the ceasefire a little after midnight on Tuesday, but neither Israeli nor Iranian officials have said they agreed to it.</p> 
  <p>The timetable of the ceasefire was also vague. According to Trump’s announcement via social media, Iran was to stop firing on Tuesday morning, and then 6 hours later Israel was to stop firing on Iran and then 24 hours later, the war would be officially declared over.</p> 
  <p>Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Aragchi said there was “no agreement on any ceasefire” in a post on X, but said that if Israel stopped bombing Israel by 4 am Tehran time, that it would also cease firing. Later, Iranian state TV said that a ceasefire was coming into effect, which it described as a being “imposed on the enemy.”<br><br>But, by Tuesday morning both Iranian and Israeli bombings were continuing, with no sign of a ceasefire on the ground.</p>

  <p><strong>An unidentified drone targeted an army radar at Iraq’s Taji military base north of Baghdad</strong>, the Iraqi state news agency reported early on Tuesday, citing a military official, as picked up by Reuters.</p> 
  <p><strong>There were no casualties, the commander of Baghdad’s operations said.</strong></p> 
  <p>In 2020, the US-led international coalition troops withdrew from the base and handed it over to Iraqi security forces. The base had historically held up to 2,000 coalition members.</p> 
  <p>The base, 20 km (12 miles) north of Baghdad, had been the site of frequent rocket attacks by Iran-backed militias targeting US-led troops months before the withdrawal.</p>

  <p>It has been a dramatic few hours in the Israel-Iran war, with <strong>retaliatory attacks from Iran on the largest US military facility in the Middle East, and claims from US president Donald Trump that a ceasefire has been agreed.</strong></p> 
  <p>Here is the latest:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>US president Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire">announced</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire"> </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire">in a social media post</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire"> </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-ceasefire">that Iran and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire</a>. </strong>“On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, “THE 12 DAY WAR,” Trump wrote on his platform, Truth Social. “This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn’t, and never will!” Trump later told NBC the ceasefire was “unlimited” and would last “forever”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump brokered the ceasefire through talks with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday while his team, including vice-president JD Vance, held talks with Tehran</strong>, a senior White House official told Reuters. The official, providing details of the ceasefire on condition of anonymity, said Israel agreed to it so long as Iran does not launch fresh attacks. Iran signalled that no further attacks would take place, the official said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>After the ceasefire was announcement by Trump, Israel’s Defence Forces issued an evacuation warning for several parts of the Iranian capital</strong>, ahead of a planned Israeli strike. On social media, some users reported massive explosions in Tehran, which they said was the most intense since Israel first started bombing Iran 12 days ago.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran’s foreign minister seemed to suggest that a cessation of hostilities had begun in a post on social media, saying Iran’s military attacked Israel</strong> <strong>“until the very last minute, at 4am.”</strong> Earlier he said that if Israeli strikes ceased at 12.30GMT Iran had “no intention to continue our response afterwards.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel is yet to officially confirm the ceasefire.</strong></p></li> 
   <li><p>According to a report from Reuters news agency, Qatar played a role in helping to broker the deal behind the scenes. <strong>Qatar’s prime minister reportedly secured Iran’s agreement in a call with Tehran</strong>, an official briefed on the matter told Reuters.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump’s proclaimed ceasefire comes after Iran announced it had</strong> <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/trump-talks-of-regime-change-in-iran-and-insists-us-obliterated-nuclear-sites">launched a missile attack on a US base</a> in the Gulf state of Qatar</strong>, at the Al Udeid Air Base, <strong>in what it said was retaliation for US participation in Israel’s bombing campaign against Iran</strong> the day before.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Qatar’s foreign ministry said that “Qatar’s air defences successfully thwarted the attack and intercepted the Iranian missiles” and there had been no casualties.</strong> Iran reportedly provided advance warning of the attack.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump at the weekend launched an <strong>unprecedented attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, including Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow</strong>. Codenamed ‘Midnight Hammer,’ the attack deployed American B-2 bombers, and so-called bunker buster bombs.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump was quick to claim that US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities had <strong>“completely and totally obliterated”</strong> them. Still, it remains unclear how much physical damage has been done or what the longer-term impact might be on Iran’s nuclear programme.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>US bombing probably caused “very significant” damage to the underground areas of Iran’s Fordow uranium enrichment plant dug into a mountain, though no one can yet tell the extent, UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Monday.</strong> “Given the explosive payload utilised and the extreme(ly) vibration-sensitive nature of centrifuges, very significant damage is expected to have occurred,” Grossi said in a statement.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The comments follow a meeting by the national security committee of <strong>Iran’s parliament, which approved the general outline of a bill meant to fully suspend Tehran’s cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog</strong>. According to the bill, installing surveillance cameras, allowing inspections, and submitting reports to the IAEA would be suspended as long as the security of nuclear facilities is not guaranteed.</p></li>
