<p><strong>Joanne, 52, Southampton</strong></p>    <p><strong>Occupation</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>Knowledge manager</p> <p><strong>Voting record</strong> Doesn’t have a party political preference, tends to focus on local issues – but mostly Labour</p> <p><strong>Amuse bouche </strong>Is a huge football fan, and held a Charlton Athletic season ticket for 20 years</p> <p><strong>Jane, 58, Winchester</strong></p>    <p><strong>Occupation</strong> A little bit of property development</p> <p><strong>Voting record</strong> Normally Conservative; wouldn’t vote Reform, would deviate for&nbsp;the Lib Dems, particularly locally</p> <p><strong>Amuse bouche </strong>Started her own kindergarten, and later a daycare nursery business, to develop a Froebelian approach. It’s a more natural philosophy, very much about the outdoors and community</p> <p><strong>For starters</strong></p> <p><strong>Jane</strong> I wasn’t late, but I’m never early. She looked like a person who’s always early and prepared. She was friendly, smiling. She didn’t look like a person I’d be meeting normally, but not in a&nbsp;terrible way, just different.</p> <p><strong>Joanne</strong> She seemed, I think, a little bit wary. Nervous of the whole situation. I&nbsp;felt OK. For me, it was just: I’m going to have a nice dinner and a chat.</p> <p><strong>Jane</strong> I ate pear salad, which was delicious – the blue cheese in it, I think it was dolcelatte, was so good. Then I&nbsp;had salmon, and a glass of rioja.</p> <p><strong>Joanne </strong>I had spicy pepper and tomato soup and sea bass.</p>    <p><strong>The big beef</strong></p> <p><strong>Joanne</strong> We’d both done a bit of research: what actually is “woke” and what does it mean? We came to similar viewpoints – that it’s been overused, and it’s grown to become anything and&nbsp;everything. For me, the people who use the word, use it in a negative way. Whereas I think the traditional meaning was often “anti-racist” – and&nbsp;why is it bad to be anti-racist?</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/03/dining-across-the-divide-he-couldnt-see-that-we-were-actually-disagreeing">Dining across the divide: ‘He couldn’t see that we were actually disagreeing’</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Jane</strong> It was interesting that it meant something different to each of us, because we’re similar ages. I think we&nbsp;came from slightly different experiences. My father is Sri Lankan, so I had a different background. Not&nbsp;that I feel strongly about that.</p> <p><strong>Joanne</strong> She didn’t think, for example, if&nbsp;there was a period drama, there should be people cast who weren’t white, because it wouldn’t fit in with the period. Whereas, for me, if they’re a&nbsp;good actor, I don’t care what colour someone is. As long as they convince you that they are the character they’re playing, that’s fine. I could see her point: if you’re making a historically accurate programme, then it has to be&nbsp;accurate. But I don’t really agree. If&nbsp;it’s a drama, it doesn’t matter.</p> <p><strong>Jane</strong> We also talked about people who want to discredit the past, and there’s a&nbsp;lot to be ashamed of. But you can’t really undo it, it is what it is. Bring the&nbsp;truth to light, learn from it, but don’t think you can undo it. Equally, it&nbsp;was a long time ago, and there were&nbsp;people doing the best they could&nbsp;in the circumstances.</p>    <p><strong>Sharing plate</strong></p> <p><strong>Joanne</strong> We talked a bit about James Bond, and whether Idris Elba should have been cast. Some of the papers were outraged. And we laughed about that, we said it was ridiculous.</p> <p><strong>Jane </strong>I felt that the best thing would be&nbsp;an Asian female James Bond. Going&nbsp;back to my period drama thing – James Bond isn’t in period now, is he? So we have to update the casting.</p>    <p><strong>For afters</strong></p> <p><strong>Jane</strong> I was inclined to think second homes were a good thing – even though&nbsp;I can see there are negative effects where they take over, it still&nbsp;gives people the opportunity to&nbsp;visit a&nbsp;place they might not otherwise see.</p> <p><strong>Joanne </strong>My dad lives in a seaside area, and it’s really sad. Most of the houses are empty except for two or three weeks of the year; businesses can’t stay&nbsp;open. She was leaning more towards “it should be allowed as long as the owners rent it out regularly”. And I&nbsp;could see that point of view, but,&nbsp;for&nbsp;me, it’s really sad: these little places are struggling, they’re dying, and they’re beautiful.</p> <p><strong>Jane </strong>There is a huge amount of legislation to maintain communities already, which I think is a good thing.</p>    <p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p> <p><strong>Joanne</strong> We actually had a really nice&nbsp;night. Both of us are middle-aged women, we don’t have children, we have a similar lifestyle. I’d definitely stop and chat if I saw her again.</p> <p><strong>Jane</strong> We were different enough not to&nbsp;be exchanging numbers, but alike enough that we’d talk if we saw each other again.</p>    <p><em>Additional reporting: Kitty Drake</em></p> <p><em>• </em>Jane and Joanne ate at <a href="https://www.oldvinewinchester.com/">The Old Vine</a> in&nbsp;Winchester</p> <p>Want to meet someone from across the divide? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/24/second-homes-big-tech-smoking-we-want-your-views-on-divisive-issues">Find out how to take part</a></p>
