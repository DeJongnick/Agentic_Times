Sometimes you can fall into the trap of fool’s gold, and try and get too loose too early, so that’ll be the biggest challenge with this combination.</em></p> <p><em>In a world where listening and understanding is difficult in the way that we live life, I think I learned the other day that listening’s dropped by about 20 per cent in the last 15 years. On average people listen for 8.25 seconds, so I think we’d rather focus on us trying to understand what we’re doing and making sure that lands in the week.</em></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68b319af8f08d02733f202f7" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-30T15:36:29.172Z">4.36pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>This is a great piece from Andy Bull.</strong></p> <p>The standout line: “It’s a sign a sport has matured that everyone involved is able to be honest about what everyone’s watching, instead of celebrating the simple fact that so many people are.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/30/womens-rugby-world-cup-needs-jeopardy-to-stay-in-monday-morning-conversations">Women’s Rugby World Cup needs jeopardy to stay in Monday morning conversations | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68b317698f08b0d009a289fa" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-30T15:27:42.980Z">4.27pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Canada made light work of Wales.</strong></p> <p>Read our report here:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/30/canada-wales-scotland-fiji-womens-rugby-world-cup-reports">McKinley Hunt’s double for Canada pushes Wales to brink of World Cup exit</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68b314dc8f08d02733f202d7" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-30T15:23:02.822Z">4.23pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Samoa team</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The Samoans, nicknamed the Manusina after the white tern found across the archipelago, are an eclectic bunch.</strong></p> <p>Among the ranks there is a primary school teacher, a nurse, a police officer and a roofer.

The simple truth is that England should win this World Cup at a canter. That is not meant to be disrespectful to the other teams. It’s just recognising the financial, emotional and cultural investment in the women’s game by the RFU and how, across every metric, they’ve left their competitors in their dust.</p> <p>Our correspondent on the ground, <strong>Sarah Rendell</strong>, has said that a Samoan victory today would be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/29/england-look-to-test-tactical-flexibility-against-samoas-inspirational-women">“one of the biggest ever upsets”</a>. She’s under selling it. It would be THE BIGGEST upset in any sport ever.</p> <p>That doesn’t mean that England should go out there and play in second gear. Despite the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/22/england-off-to-a-flier-in-11-try-womens-rugby-world-cup-mauling-of-usa">69-7 scoreline in their opening win over USA</a>, they weren’t perfect. A flawless show here this afternoon would underline the team’s supremacy.</p> <p>A win won’t do. A bonus point won’t do. Even a cricket score won’t do. What England need is an 80 minute performance where things click, where shapes form on attack and systems function as they should on defence. Line-outs, mauls and scrums need to thrum with mechanical efficiency. Kicks and passes need to land where they’re aimed. </p> <p>Will it all come together? We’ll find out when things get going at <strong>5pm BST </strong>in Northampton.</p> <p>Teams, updates and other bits to come.</p> <p><a href="mailto:aniel.gallan.casual@guardian.co.uk">If you’d like to get in touch please write in.</a></p> </div>   </div>
