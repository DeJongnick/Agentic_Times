<p>Brent Hinds, the former lead guitarist of the acclaimed heavy metal group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/mastodon">Mastodon</a>, was killed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/atlanta">Atlanta</a> overnight.</p> <p>Police said Hinds, 51, died late on Wednesday after his Harley-Davidson collided with a BMW SUV whose driver did not yield while making a turn. The crash occurred at about 11.35pm.</p> <p>The Fulton county medical examiner’s office later confirmed his death.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/15/megadeth-announce-they-are-retiring-dont-be-sad-be-happy-for-us-all">Megadeth announce they are retiring: ‘Don’t be sad, be happy for us all’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hinds co-founded Mastodon in 2000 alongside bassist Troy Sanders, guitarist Bill Kelliher and drummer Brann Dailor, and went on to gain recognition for his role in the Atlanta-based band.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mastodonrocks/p/DNn8zQwJJhh/">a statement</a> posted to Instagram, Mastodon said they were in a “state of unfathomable sadness and grief”.</p> <p>“We are heartbroken, shocked, and still trying to process the loss of this creative force with whom we’ve shared so many triumphs, milestones, and the creation of music that has touched the hearts of so many,” the band wrote. “Our hearts are with Brent’s family, friends, and fans. At this time, we please ask that you respect everyone’s privacy during this difficult time.”</p> <p>Earlier this year, Billboard reported that Mastodon and Hinds had “mutually decided to part ways”. But earlier this month, Hinds disputed that account, saying he was forced out and referring to his ex-bandmates as “horrible humans”.</p> <p>Mastodon released their debut album, Remission, in 2002. Their hardcore sound that combined prog-rock, alternative and grunge among other styles quickly caught the attention of heavy metal fans, and their follow-up record, Leviathan, elevated the group to the metal music mainstream.</p> <p>Despite the group’s heavy metal influences, Hinds told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/24/brent-hinds-mastodon-guitarist-hate-heavy-metal">the Guardian</a> back in 2009 that he felt the band were more classic rock than metal. “That’s the direction I’ve always wanted us to take,” he said. “I never wanted us to be this screaming, lumbering, lotsa-drum-solos band, I always wanted us to be this heavy, psychedelic thing.”</p> <p>Hinds also had a small foray into television when he, along with his former band members, made a brief appearance on the popular HBO series Game of Thrones as “wildings” in the show’s fifth season.</p>
