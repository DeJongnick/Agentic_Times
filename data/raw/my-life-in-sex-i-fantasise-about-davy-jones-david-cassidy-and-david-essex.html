<p>Since 2010, my sex life has been 3D, retro and virtual. It involves <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/29/davy-jones">Davy Jones </a>of the Monkees, <a href="http://www.davidessex.com/">David Essex </a>and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/nov/18/david-cassidy-hospital-organ-failure">David Cassidy</a>, all as they were between 1971 and 1975. They arrive in my head, resplendent in flares and tank tops, gazing out through smoky, heavily lashed eyes and whispering in deep, dark tones that can only be detected by the ear of a teenage girl.</p> <p>I try to arrange my fantasy schedule so they don’t arrive at once. This isn’t always possible, and I am then presented with the option of a mix-and-match experience, or making them queue. We always start with a date. The cinema, a Chinese meal or a disco. If Mum and Dad are at bingo, we stay home and indulge in a Vesta Chow Mein and Bird’s Trifle.</p> <p>Although fiercely jealous, each David has learned to tolerate the pictures of the other Davids on my bedroom wall. Each is passionate, adoring, powerful, sensitive and generous. Our love-making is light yet intense, each David taking me to places only we have shared; our special places. Each thinks only of me, always. All songs are written for me alone, and in every photo shoot for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/04/jackie-first-uk-teen-magazine-girls-jacqueline-wilson">Jackie magazine</a>, he is looking down the camera just at me.</p> <p>Afterwards, we smoke a Player’s No 6 (without inhaling), and discuss plans for a honeymoon in Marbella. I am saving Mum’s Green Shield stamps for a canteen of cutlery. I sometimes worry that I am using them, that spending all this time with me will prevent them from meeting others. The guilt passes quickly, spurred on by the bald, snoring and whisky-sodden mass who lies next to me.</p> <p>• Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?
