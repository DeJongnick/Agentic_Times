<p>The Trump administration is dismantling the National Science Foundation (NSF), which critics say risks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/03/national-science-foundation-trump-cuts">losing a generation of scientific talent</a> and jeopardizes the future of US industries and economic growth.</p> <p>The NSF, founded in 1950, is the only federal agency that funds fundamental research across all fields of science and engineering. It has contributed to major scientific breakthroughs and innovations.</p> <p>But Trump’s tax-and-spend bill includes a 56% cut to the current $9bn NSF budget, as well as a 73% reduction in staff and fellowships. And at least 1,653 active NSF research grants already authorized have been abruptly cancelled midway, according to Grant Watch. New proposals are also being screened for connection to diversity, equity or inclusion.</p> <p>We want to hear from scientists, researchers and students affected by the Trump administration’s cuts. How has your research been affected by changes at the National Science Foundation and other agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency? What impact will this have on US scientific output? What are your specific concerns about the fallout of these policies?</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="7914c320-001f-498f-9c5f-1a2b3afc3f2d" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <h2><strong>This Community callout closed on 31 July 2025.</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>You can see the article that included respondents to this callout <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/20/science-trump-funding-cuts-layoffs">here</a>.</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>You can contribute to open Community callouts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-community-team">here</a> or Share a story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/sep/02/guardianwitness-send-us-a-story">here</a>.</strong></p></li> </ul>
