<h2>What are you most looking forward to, on or off the court?</h2> <p><strong>The dissolution of the Pac-12 means some new and unusual conference battles</strong> that look like midseason Sweet 16 matchups. UCLA v Indiana in Bloomington? Arizona v Kansas in Lawrence? Regular-season basketball in the Big Ten and Big 12 will either produce battle-tested teams for the NCAA tournament … or exhausted ones. <strong>Gabriel Baumgaertner</strong></p> <p><strong>Seeing what’s next for the women’s game.</strong> The NCAA women’s tournament final outdrawing the men’s title game would have been unthinkable even a couple of years ago, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/09/ncaa-basketball-womens-ratings-better-than-mens-tournament">that’s exactly what happened in April</a> thanks to stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. They’ve since departed for the WNBA, but the machinery that got them in front of eyeballs (increased funding, social media, NIL deals) appears built to last. UConn’s Paige Bueckers, USC’s JuJu Watkins, LSU’s Flau’jae Johnson and Notre Dame’s Hannah Hidalgo are just a few of the returning stars ready to take up the baton. <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong></p> <p><strong>Watching Bueckers playing her final season </strong>and this year’s potential WNBA rookies battle it out on the court. I’m also looking forward to becoming more familiar with NCAA men’s basketball that I’ve been in the past. As someone born and raised in the state, I am backing Alabama and excited to learn more about the team this year. <strong>Stephanie Kaloi</strong></p> <p><strong>How the veteran coaches will do at their new stops.</strong> Guys like John Calipari at Arkansas, Eric Musselman at Southern California and Mark Pope at Kentucky. All three had disappointing finishes to last year’s season and will look to bounce back with a change in scenery. In year one at their previous stops all three got off to a hot start with 20-plus wins respectively. <strong>Nicholas Levine</strong></p> <h2>Cooper Flagg is the most exciting college prospect since …</h2> <p><strong>Carmelo Anthony.</strong> None other than <a href="https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/a62371732/lebron-james-hennessy-limited-edition-interview/?taid=66f568e7c50d320001ca2cd5&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthemTWESQ&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">LeBron James indicated</a> that Flagg will be “a big-time player for Team USA down the road”. It’s a lot of hype and one college season is almost never a great indicator of future success, but he is a super-prospect who is all but guaranteed to be the No 1 overall pick in 2025 NBA draft. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p>You don’t even have to leave Durham to find him. Even if you didn’t go in for the bully ball of <strong>Zion Williamson</strong> stylistically, there’s no question the Duke star moved the needle both before and during his brief spell on campus. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Caitlin Clark!</strong> I promise I’m not just stanning. Clark was the necessary catalyst to spur changes to the WNBA that were already in motion. After last year’s relatively underwhelming NBA draft class, Flagg is the kind of headline-grabbing prospect that will make this season of NCAA men’s basketball fun to watch. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Kevin Durant.</strong> Flagg has a rare skillset and feel for the game for someone with his size. At 6ft 9in Flagg can score from all three levels and guard multiple positions on defense. He is still only 17, which adds to his intrigue. He may not be the scorer Durant was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCaXpKFHAaE">in his only year at Texas</a>, but Flagg may be able to make more of an impact with his overall game. <strong>NL</strong></p>    <h2>Has NIL been good or bad for college basketball?</h2> <p><strong>It seems to have created significantly more parity</strong>, making the NCAA tournament more unpredictable than ever. Ultimately, the most successful programs will be the ones that are able to retain their top talent for more than one season and form a cohesive unit with the inevitable transfers that arrive. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Your mileage may vary.</strong> March Madness has become a billion-dollar business, so it was about time the players were permitted to earn something for what’s effectively a full-time job. But the transfer portal and loosening of NIL rules has warped the recruiting process almost beyond recognition, prompting the early retirements of great coaches like Tony Bennett and Jay Wright (with plenty more certain to follow). <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Depends on who you ask.</strong> NIL has been great for many players, and a not-so-great thing for many teams. I really love that athletes who generate so much money are being compensated for doing so but don’t love how this encourages players to hop from school to school and to overlook some programs entirely because they can’t bring a lot of NIL money to the table. This has skewed the dynamic between the pursuit of basketball and financial reward; players are not going to programs because those programs will benefit them (and vice-versa), they’re going to whatever program can pay them the most. A great example is Hailey Van Lith, who was once predicted to be a top-10 draft pick but has since fallen off most lists completely due to the pursuit of financial gain. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Not great in its current form.</strong> Bennett was not shy about his feelings on the state of college basketball and why that was a factor into his unexpected retirement. NIL was originally meant to allow the players to earn money based on their marketability. It has evolved into guaranteed payments before a kid even steps on campus and is a major factor in recruiting. The NCAA needs to establish guidelines that will help get NIL back to the way it was originally intended: to help student-athletes. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>The surprise package of the season will be …</h2> <p><strong>Rutgers’ men’s team</strong> features two players – Ace Bailey and Dylan Harper – who may be top-five selections in the 2025 NBA draft. It’s a challenge for any head coach to make a deep tournament run led by one-and-dones (just ask Calipari), but Steve Pikiell is a skilled tactician who values toughness and discipline. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Indiana men.</strong> After finishing 19-14 last year and missing the NCAA tournament, the Hoosiers are sufficiently armed for a bounceback season after adding heralded transfers Oumar Ballo, Myles Rice and Kanaan Carlyle to the returning core. It will be on coach Mike Woodson to get the rotations right, but there’s enough talent on the roster to see Indiana through to their first Elite Eight appearance in more than two decades. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Texas women.</strong> After more than a few false starts (they haven’t been to the Final Four since 2003), I am absolutely convinced this is the Longhorns’ year. Rori Harmon is back from injury and from all reports is better than ever, while Madison Booker appears to have grown into a leadership role after taking the first steps last season. The rest of the teams in the Big 12 need to watch out. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>The <strong>University of California San Diego men</strong>. Making the transition from D-II, the Tritons shocked the Big West last year finishing second in the conference after the preseason coaches poll predicted they would end up ninth. They’ll look to build that success with an experienced roster of proven scorers: six of their current players have already eclipsed the 1,000-point mark. Don’t be surprised if you see the Tritons playing in the NCAA tournament for the first time that they’re eligible. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>Which team in either preseason top 10 will struggle?</h2> <p>It would be a shock to see any of these teams miss, but the <strong>Arizona men</strong> will find life much more challenging in the Big 12 than they did in the Pac-12. Maybe the Wildcats enter the tournament as a No 6 or No 7 seed instead of theur usual slot around No 2. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Iowa State women.</strong> Super sophomore Audi Crooks, whose national profile does not yet correspond to her talent level, will be the focal point in the post. And head coach Bill Fennelly did manage to address last year’s three-point shooting woes by adding Lily Hansford, Kenzie Hare and Sydney Harris through the portal. But can they defend? <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Iowa State women.</strong> The Cyclones have a lofty No 8 preseason ranking, but their non-conference schedule is extremely challenging: they’ll go up against South Carolina, Iowa and UConn. They may surprise me and pull it off, but ... I’m not convinced this is their year. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>North Carolina men.</strong> The Tar Heels do return the ACC player of the year in RJ Davis, who should once again be among the conference leaders in scoring, but will he be as effective without Armando Bacot? The departed 6ft 11in center demanded interior attention and forced opponents to make difficult decisions on how to guard the Davis-Bacot ball screens. There is no one on the roster with the size and athleticism to fill his shoes. UNC also lost key pieces in Cormac Ryan and Harrison Ingram. <strong>NL</strong></p>    <h2>The men’s national player of the year will be …</h2> <p><strong>RJ Davis, North Carolina.</strong> Flagg is the easy answer, but I’ll guess that the gatekeepers prefer to vote for a veteran senior guard before an all-world freshman. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Mark Sears, Alabama.</strong> Granted an extra year of eligibility due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 6ft 1in point guard is back for a fifth season after leading the Crimson Tide to the first Final Four in school history last March while shooting better than 50% from the floor and 43% from three. Nate Oats’ fast-paced offense will give his statistics the extra juice they’ll need in a competitive race. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Mark Sears, Alabama.</strong> He was arguably the best player in men’s college basketball last year and it’s hard to imagine him doing anything but improving this year. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Hunter Dickinson, Kansas.</strong> The Jayhawks have question marks, but if they can live up to the hype I expect them to be the overall No 1 seed with the experienced Dickinson, who transferred from Michigan the year before last, being the best player on the best team. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>The women’s national player of the year will be …</h2> <p><strong>Paige Bueckers, UConn.</strong> It’s been a long, injury-riddled journey for the standout UConn guard, but she’ll need to be an anchor for the otherwise young Huskies. Look for her to remind the country why she was considered a potentially generational talent before the nation knew of Clark. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>JuJu Watkins, Southern California. </strong>Coke or Pepsi? Xbox or PlayStation? The season-long debate between Watkins and Bueckers (and their passionate fandoms) is already off to a <a href="https://www.themirror.com/sport/basketball/juju-watkins-paige-bueckers-basketball-780479">heated start</a>. It’s too close to call at the moment and may not be much easier in March. Save the date: Watkins’ Trojans meet Bueckers’ Huskies in a 21 December non-conference game at Hartford’s XL Center that’s already sold out. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>JuJu Watkins, Southern California.</strong> She was the player to watch last year as a freshman and there is no reason to doubt that she will be even more compelling this season. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>JuJu Watkins, Southern California. </strong>Watkins will look to build off of her incredible freshman campaign in which she lit up the scoresheet nightly with averages of 27.1 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 2.3 steals per game. Her feel for the game and overall skillset make her the most dynamic women’s player in the country. <strong>NL</strong></p>    <h2>The hottest NBA prospect is …</h2> <p><strong>Cooper Flagg, Duke.</strong> If he passes and handles the ball as well as scouts say he does, he’ll draw the loftiest comparisons imaginable (like, say, Magic Johnson). <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Cooper Flagg, Duke.</strong> Most have had the combo forward pencilled in for the No 1 pick for some time and with good reason. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IB__mNfsqw">was a cheat code</a> in the Nike EYBL 16U league (averaging 26.8 points, 12.4 rebounds, 5.2 blocks and 4.7 assists), delivered on expectations in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC8y4DwX0AM">Nike Hoop Summit</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1YD47f2Ybk">Jordan Brand Classic</a> showcase games and was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys_gKYXDjEY">invited to practice with Team USA</a> ahead of the Paris Olympics. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Cooper Flagg, Duke.</strong> Once he gets his freshman year out of the way he’s going to be the central talking point of next year’s draft. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Cooper Flagg, Duke</strong>. A strong season for the Blue Devils would make Flagg the no-brainer No 1 overall pick. Let the Fail for Flagg campaign begin for NBA teams. <strong>NL</strong></p>       <figure class="element element-video element--showcase" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys_gKYXDjEY"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ys_gKYXDjEY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Duk’e’s Cooper Flagg, 17, was invited to practice with Team USA ahead of the Paris Olympics.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>The hottest WNBA prospect is …</h2> <p><strong>JuJu Watkins, Southern California.</strong> She averaged over 27 points per game in her freshman year and scored more points than any other freshman in Division I history (920). She may not attract the attention that Clark did, but Watkins will put up some gaudy scoring totals and might average double-digit rebounds too. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Paige Bueckers, Connecticut.</strong> For the second straight year, the No 1 pick in the WNBA draft will be a no-brainer. And thanks to the LA Sparks’ dismal nine-win season, <a href="https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-lottery-2025-statefarm">there’s a good chance</a> she’ll end up alongside Cameron Brink and Rickea Jackson in Hollywood, a prospect that will no doubt have the league’s marketing department salivating. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Paige Bueckers, Connecticut.</strong> She is widely expected to have a dominant final collegiate season and will undoubtedly be drafted at the No 1 or No 2 spot – but USC’s Kiki Iriafen, who transferred from Stanford, is right there with her. For me, the pair are neck-and-neck for this title. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>JuJu Watkins, Southern California</strong>. She has the size and skill to be an immediate star in the W whenever she decides to make the jump. <strong>NL</strong></p>    <h2>One bold prediction</h2> <p><strong>The UConn men are knocked out in the first weekend.</strong> Huskies coach Dan Hurley is brilliant, but he has to replace four NBA draft picks and get a very new team to adjust to his extremely intense and demanding playing style. Hurley is not a coach to bet against, but this year will be a challenge for the defending champs and their bid for a rare NCAA tournament three-peat will be thwarted earlier than expected. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>A men’s team will win their first national championship.</strong> Alabama, Houston and Gonzaga each have the personnel to make Final Four runs. It says here one of them will break through for their school’s maiden title. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Rori Harmon will get chosen in the top five of the WNBA draft.</strong> Maybe even top three. Everyone has the 5ft 6in point guard projected lower in the draft and with good reason, but I expect Harmon to have such a monster year for Texas that it will be hard for too many teams to pass her over. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>The Villanova men win the Big East.</strong> The Wildcats are coming off consecutive below-standard years and head coach Kyle Neptune needs to turn that around in year three. With a talented roster with a mix of returners and transfers, Villanova could surprise the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jan/10/college-basketball-big-east-conference-renaissance">college basketball’s purest conference</a>. Look for La Salle point guard transfer Jhamir Brikus to have a breakout year. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>Men’s Final Four</h2> <p>Alabama, Florida, Gonzaga, Houston. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p>Alabama, Duke, Houston, Kansas. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Connecticut, Duke, Gonzaga, Iowa State. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>Arizona, Gonzaga, Kansas, Purdue. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>Men’s national champion</h2> <p><strong>Houston</strong> coach Kelvin Sampson has spent much of the last decade on the wrong end of untimely injuries and heartbreaking buzzer-beaters in March. This year, he leads a balanced veteran squad to the title that has eluded him since he took the Cougars job in 2014. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Alabama.</strong> The Crimson Tide return five rotation players from a Final Four team, including a first-team preseason All-American at the point, while adding four heralded transfers and a pair of five-star recruits. It’s a cocktail of depth and experience that will benefit from playing in college basketball’s deepest conference and be aged to perfection by March. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Gonzaga.</strong> Right now, I feel like this year is the Bulldogs’ to lose after multiple seasons of coming so close. The team is full of talented returning players including offensive standouts Graham Ike and Nolan Hickman in addition to Ryan Nembhard, who brings a stability that’s needed. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Kansas.</strong> Bill Self has a predicted starting lineup of all juniors and seniors. Dickinson and Dajuan Harris Jr are two of the most experienced big game players in college basketball. If the Jayhawks stay healthy they could be tearing down nets in San Antonio. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>Women’s Final Four</h2> <p>Connecticut, North Carolina State, South Carolina, UCLA. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p>Connecticut, Notre Dame, Texas, South Carolina. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Connecticut, South Carolina, Southern California, Texas. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>Connecticut, Notre Dame, South Carolina, Southern California. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>Women’s national champion</h2> <p><strong>South Carolina.</strong> It feels lazy to select the Gamecocks every year, but head coach Dawn Staley more or less overhauled her team’s playing style last year (after the prior year’s team lost in the Final Four) to incorporate better outside shooting. The Gamecocks finished the season 38-0 and won their third national title in seven tournaments. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>South Carolina.</strong> Kamilla Cardoso, who led last year’s undefeated national champions in scoring, rebounds, blocks and field-goal percentage, has left for the WNBA. But Staley’s squad returns 87% of their minutes played and 84% of their points scored. You’ve got to give them the edge at the moment over UConn, who will start the season without a number of key players due to injury. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>South Carolina … </strong>or<strong> Southern California.</strong> I don’t want to answer this question! Any answer other than South Carolina feels wrong, but USC is an answer that doesn’t feel … <em>not</em> right. I’m leaning toward the Gamecocks, but would not at all be surprised if the Trojans take it. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Connecticut.</strong> Bueckers will lead the Huskies back to the promised land after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/05/iowa-uconn-south-carolina-nc-state-final-four-scores">coming so close but falling short</a> last season. <strong>NL</strong></p>
