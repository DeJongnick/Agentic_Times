<h2>Amol Rajan Goes to the Ganges</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One<br></strong>Journalist Amol Rajan has been “in a bit of a funk” since his father died three years ago. Rajan gradually realised that his mother, a practising Hindu, “seemed to have an emotional toolkit that I lacked”. Has this lack of faith made it harder to come to terms with bereavement? With this question in mind, he travels to India to take part in the Hindu festival Kumbh Mela. Initially, he’s slightly overwhelmed by the intensity of the pilgrimage, not to mention emotionally triggered by seeing so many older Indian men who remind him of his dad. And he’s soon faced with more tragedy, as a crush causes 30 deaths. In the wake of this new sadness, can he find closure? <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Side Hustlers</h2> <p><strong>8pm, U&amp;W</strong><strong><br></strong>A hyperactive transatlantic twist on Dragons’ Den.

Not everyone can win investment, so expect plenty of drama. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Electric Cars: How Safe Are They?</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 5</strong><strong><br></strong>As tech journo Georgie Barrat says: “Technology is amazing, but also, it can go wrong.” With the UK aiming to phase out all new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, this programme claims to take a balanced look at EV safety, and look beyond scare stories of electric cars suddenly bursting into flames on the driveway.<em>Ali Catterall</em></p>    <h2>Long Lost Family: Born Without Trace</h2> <p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong><strong><br></strong>The stirring series that gives closure to foundlings continues, with two more adoptees gaining insight into their mysterious starts in life.
