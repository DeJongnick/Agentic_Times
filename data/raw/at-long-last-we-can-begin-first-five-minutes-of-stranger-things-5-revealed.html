<p>The fifth and final series of Netflix’s supernatural smash hit Stranger Things is set to be one of the biggest shows of the year. The first part airs on 27 November, but a clip of the chilling opening five minutes has been shared online.</p> <p>The episode, The Crawl, takes fans back to the start of the series in 1983, after the disappearance of Will Byers (Noah Schnapp).</p> <p>“Should I stay or should I go?” Will sings as he tries to keep calm in the Upside Down. Things quickly become terrifying when a demogorgon appears and drags Will to the lair of Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower). “At long last, we can begin,” he tells Will while shooting a vine down his throat. “You and I, we are going to do such beautiful things together.”</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhFPHYgILN0"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhFPHYgILN0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The second part of the concluding series will air on Boxing Day, with the final episode out on New Year’s Day – which will also be screened in select cinemas.</p> <p>The synopsis reads: “The fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished – his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming – and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone – the full party – standing together, one last time.”</p> <p>The surprise clip was uploaded to YouTube after the show’s Los Angeles premiere on Thursday, which was attended by cast members including Millie Bobby Brown and David Harbour.</p> <p>“The scale of it is bigger … It’s more action and more special effects, but it’s also by far the most emotional season because it’s the end of the story for all of these characters,” the series’ co-creator, Matt Duffer, recently said of the final episodes.</p> <p>Ross Duffer, his brother and co-creator, added: “Bringing it out in the world is nerve-racking, but we’re ready to finally show it.”</p>
