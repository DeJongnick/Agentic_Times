<p>Penny Mordaunt has taken a job advising one of the world’s biggest tobacco companies on “harm reduction”.</p> <p>The former Conservative leadership contender, who served in cabinet roles from defence secretary to leader of the House of Commons, will advise British American Tobacco’s (BAT) “transformation advisory group” in a paid role, after losing her seat in parliament last year.</p> <p>The former MP abstained on a vote on Rishi Sunak’s gradual smoking ban in the early stages of the bill last year, and was in charge of the government’s legislative programme when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/23/uk-election-tobacco-vapes-bill-smoking-commons-parliament">proposed law did not make it through parliament before the election</a>.</p> <p>Labour had urged the government to defy convention and push through the tobacco and vapes bill even though it was in its early stages when the election was called. It was subsequently brought forward by Labour.</p> <p>Mordaunt’s new job was revealed by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, which said she should not lobby the government for two years after leaving office or advise on any public contracts.</p> <p>In its analysis, it said: “British American Tobacco has a significant interest in government policy and regulation and has resources focused on influencing government decisions – for example lobbying for a reduction in taxes for cigarettes, legislation on vaping and the prevention of counterfeit goods.”</p> <p>The committee said there were only limited risks associated with Mordaunt’s access to information that could help BAT given the change of government and amount of time that had passed.</p> <p>However, it added: “Whilst you said you will not lobby, there is a risk your former role as a cabinet minister will be seen to offer British American Tobacco unfair access to and influence within government. Therefore, the committee’s advice is that you should have no direct engagement with government on behalf of the company, as to do so would raise significant risks under the government’s rules.”</p> <p>Anti-smoking campaigners view the claims of tobacco companies that they are working on harm reduction with scepticism given their continued reliance on selling cigarettes.</p> <p>Hazel Cheeseman, the chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said: “While BAT is making 80% of its revenue for the sale of combusted tobacco it is very difficult to see that they are serious in their commitment to reduce the harm from tobacco. The only way to avoid the lethal impact of smoking is not to do it at all, so BAT’s share price would be in serious trouble were the smokers of the world able to completely stop overnight.</p> <p>“They rely, as they ever have, on the fact that they sell a highly addictive product which means that, while many of their customers might want to quit, many never will before smoking kills them.”</p> <p>It is unusual in recent years for former ministers to work for tobacco companies, and several MPs have previously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/29/tory-and-dup-mps-criticised-wining-dining-tobacco-firms">been criticised for taking hospitality from the industry</a>. Ken Clarke, a Conservative former chancellor and health secretary, worked for BAT from 1998 to 2007.</p> <p>Asked about Mordaunt’s appointment, Kingsley Wheaton, the chief corporate officer at BAT, said: “BAT have launched a manifesto for change … it is founded on the very best tobacco harm reduction (THR) thinking and science.</p> <p>“To accelerate that ambition, we understand alternative viewpoints that challenge our thinking will maximise success. This THR advisory board is designed to do just that.”</p> <p>Mordaunt was approached for comment.</p>
