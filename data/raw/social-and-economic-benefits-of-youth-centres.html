<p>Simon Jenkins’ article on the value of youth centres is much needed and long overdue (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/25/britain-youth-centres-politics-crime">Youth centres may seem tame fare for politicians. But I’ve seen firsthand how they cut crime”, 25 April</a>). In addition to his emphasis on how they can help steer young people away from crime and violence, their wider societal benefits also need to be highlighted. </p> <p>Research published by <a href="https://www.ukyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Economic-Value-of-Youth-Work-Full-Report.pdf">UK Youth in 2022</a>, for example, concluded that by also improving health (including mental health) and opening up employment and educational opportunities, youth&nbsp;work in England has a “direct economic value” of £5.7bn and an indirect value of at least £3.2bn. And that is before we begin to take into account the informal educational opportunities they open up, plus the chance for young people to discover talents that they may not know they have, or lack the confidence to try out.<br><strong>Bernard Davies</strong><br><em>Leamington Spa, Warwickshire</em></p> <p>• Simon Jenkins highlights a much-neglected form of provision for young people. As he notes, youth centres and other forms of youth work do not just keep young people away from trouble but offer them opportunities to develop the skills that will help them towards more fulfilling lives. One unremarked consequence of the savage cuts to youth provision since 2010 has been a parallel reduction in the availability of training courses for youth workers, who are vital supporters, challengers and mentors. </p> <p>Youth services have always been a partnership between the state, voluntary bodies and, increasingly, young people themselves. The government is promising a raft of “strategies” – for steel, defence, social care. When can we expect one for work with young people?<br><strong>Tom Wylie</strong><br><em>Former CEO, National Youth Agency</em></p>
