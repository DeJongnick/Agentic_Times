Markets have bought heavily into the idea that central banks will get policy just right, engineering a return of inflation to targets without a recession. That may be true in the US, it looks less clearcut for the eurozone.</p> <p>The second risk is that the war in the Middle East escalates and leads to a sharp increase in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/15/oil-price-falls-china-middle-east-brent-crude-opec">oil prices.</a> So far, commodity markets have been relaxed about the heightened tension because they see no immediate danger of crude supplies being cut off, but that could rapidly change. Gourinchas said: “An escalation in regional conflicts, especially in the Middle East, could pose serious risks for commodity markets.” It is a warning worth heeding.</p> <p>Finally, there’s the elephant in the room – the possibility that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> will return to the White House after next month’s US presidential election. While not mentioning the former president by name, the IMF estimates that a shift towards “undesirable” industrial and trade policies could reduce global GDP by 0.5 percentage points in 2026.</p> <p>As far as the IMF is concerned, imposing trade barriers and subsidising domestic industry provides a sugar rush but the measures often lead to retaliation and fail to improve living standards in the longer term.</p> </blockquote> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

measures implemented by countries over the last five years, from 1,000 in 2019 to 3,000 today.</p> <p>The IMF has calculated the impact of rising trade tensions, leading to a permanent increase in tariffs starting in mid-2025 and affecting a sizable swath of global trade.</p> <p>This, it says, would cut 0.8% off global GDP in 2025, and another 1.3% in 2026.</p> <p><strong>Gourinchas </strong>says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There is definitely a direction of travel here that we are very concerned about, because a lot of these trade-distorting measures could reflect decisions by countries that are self-centred and could be ultimately harmful not only to the global economy… but also hurful for the countries who implement them as well.</p> <p>The impact on global trade also makes the residents of a country [implementing tariffs] poorer.</p> </blockquote> <p>[Reminder, Trump has proposed a 10% across-the-board levy on all products imported into the U.S. from

the risk of financial crises.</strong></p> <p>Speaking at the Bloomberg Global Regulatory Forum in New York, Bailey channels mythological Greek <strong>Cassandra</strong> – whose warnings were accurate, but ignored.</p> <p><strong>Bailey</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>As a previous financial crisis recedes over time, it is not unusual to believe that a new era has arrived. In such conditions, Cassandra like warnings that nothing basic has changed and there is a financial breaking point that can have severe economic consequences are ignored.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also cites economics professor <strong>Hyman</strong> <strong>Minsky</strong>, who explained that the growth phase of a cycle in credit markets or business activity will end with a sudden, major collapse of asset values (<em>A ‘Minsky moment’</em>).</p> <p><strong>Bailey </strong>explains that memories of financial crises recede over time and can be replaced by happier thoughts of a new era arriving.</p> <p>Warning against ‘the trap of complacency’, <strong>Bailey</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I can observe this happening with the global financial crisis fifteen years or so on. I do get people telling me that ‘you have solved that one so we can relax’. But the work I set out above on theory and history is timeless. So, let’s not fall into the trap of complacency.</p> </blockquote> <p>To combat these risks, <strong>Bailey</strong> says, regulators need better surveillance tools – particularly to keep track of the non-bank sector, which he calls “very large, and growing” [these are companies who offer similar services to banks, but aren’t actually banks]</p> <p>And he wraps up with five messages on how to ensure financial stability, starting with the importance of macro-prudential regulation (rather than just a list of potential problems].</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>System-wide matters and should not disappear amid laundry lists.</p> <p>Second, we must heed Minsky’s warning that memories of financial crises past do recede. Message three is that we have seen a shift in financial intermediation towards non-banks – from money to finance if you like and this presents distinct challenges. Message four is that one of these challenges is the pressing need for new surveillance tools.</p> <p>And message five is that there is also a need for central banks to reconsider their liquidity provision tools to non-banks while not undermining the singleness and uniqueness of money.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-10-22T14:02:25.211Z">at 3.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6717a63b8f087dde7205e164" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-10-22T13:36:58.202Z">2.36pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">IMF: Countries such as UK face a 'narrow path' on debt levels</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The IMF’s chief economist has warned that countries such as the UK are treading a “narrow path” as they try to bring debt levels down.</strong></p> <p><strong>Pierre-Olivier</strong> <strong>Gourinchas</strong> has been asked about Rachel Reeves’s plans to change the UK’s fiscal rule, to allow more investment in the budget, and about the risks of making too dramatic a change in fiscal policies.</p> <p>He tells the press pack in Washington that the IMF will evaluate the details of the budget once Rachel Reeves has given it, rather than giving judgement now.</p> <p>But he then says that the “broader question” is relevant for many countries, not just UK, who are treading a “narrow path in terms of fiscal consolidation”.</p> <p><strong>Gourinchas </strong>explains that when countries have elevated debt levels, when interest rates are high, when growth is “OK but not great”, there is a risk that “things could escalate or get out of control quickly”.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>So there is a need to bring debt levels down, stabilise then when they are not stabilised, and rebuild fiscal buffers.</p> <p>That is true for many countries around the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>Countries who don’t do that will later find themselves “the mercy of market pressures” that will force an uncontrolled adjustment, <strong>Gourinchas warns, </strong>adding:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>At which point you have very few degrees of freedom.
