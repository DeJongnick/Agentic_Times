<p>Sport England will meet the Rugby Football League in the coming weeks to air their concerns over developments at the governing body. It is a move that could affect the sport’s financial outlook.</p> <p>Rugby league is one of several sports in receipt of millions of pounds worth of funding from Sport England every year. That is critical to the existence of the sport and is particularly important for the RFL, with continued adherence to the code for sports governance essential to maintain it.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/30/super-league-expansion-may-put-vital-partnership-with-sky-sports-in-jeopardy">Super League expansion may put future deal with Sky Sports at risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The RFL has been under scrutiny in recent months with its former chief executive Nigel Wood returning to the organisation, initially as its interim chair after the resignation of Simon Johnson in March.</p> <p>Wood was appointed by clubs to lead a strategic review of the professional game, which recommended Super League expanding to 14 teams as early as 2026. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/28/super-league-to-add-two-clubs-and-return-to-14-team-competition-for-2026">That was approved by clubs</a> at a meeting in Leeds on Monday, two weeks on from Wood’s interim position as chair being made permanent.</p> <p>The code details all key leadership appointments – such as chair of the governing body – have to follow recruitment processes that are deemed “open and transparent” by Sport England. Meetings are planned in light of Wood’s installation as permanent chair.</p> <p>Sport England spokesperson said: “All organisations in receipt of significant funding from Sport England must reach the standards of the Code for Sports Governance. This includes major leadership appointments following open and transparent recruitment processes. Following recent developments, we will meet with the leadership of the RFL in the coming weeks to address our concerns.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2025/jul/31/rugby-league-lions-andy-farrell-australia">What happened to the rugby league Lions – and could they be revived?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tony Sutton, the RFL’s CEO, said: “The RFL is working with Sport England on a Governance Action Plan, following the resignations from the Board earlier in the year. The new board at the RFL remain totally committed to working towards full compliance with Sport England’s Code for Sports Governance.”</p> <p>Wood’s return was seen by many as controversial. He left his role as chief executive in 2018 and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/16/rfl-2m-losses-over-300000-nigel-wood">was paid a severance package of more than £300,000</a>. He has since held the role of chair at Bradford Bulls, a role he relinquished in order to return to the RFL, though he remains a shareholder of the Championship club. However, those same clubs now feel he is the best individual for the overhaul of the professional game, led by an expansion of Super League to 14 teams.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed on Wednesday how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/30/super-league-expansion-may-put-vital-partnership-with-sky-sports-in-jeopardy">Sky Sports were seeking answers from Super League</a> on the decision to extend the competition. The RFL have been approached for comment.</p>
