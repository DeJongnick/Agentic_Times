<p>Streaming services like Netflix, Stan, and Disney+ may be forced to produce Australian content if the Albanese government’s long-awaited legislation going before parliament this week is waved through.</p> 
<p>Australian TV broadcasters are already subject to content quotas which mean that at least 55% of the content they broadcast between 6am and midnight must be Australian.</p> 
<p>Prior to 2020, they also had sub-quotas for children’s shows, drama and documentary programs. However, these sub-quotas were removed in 2020 when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/15/local-content-quotas-suspended-in-54m-package-for-australias-coronavirus-hit-media">the Coalition government introduced a point system</a> instead to allow more flexibility for commercial broadcasters.</p> 
<p>The result, as shown in <a href="https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/fact-finders/production-trends/australian-tv-vod/childrens-tv-and-vod-drama">this chart based on data from Screen Australia</a>, is that children’s TV production hit an all-time low of just 35 hours of content in the 2023-24 financial year:</p> 
<p>Almost all Australian children’s TV content is now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/may/27/commercial-spending-on-local-childrens-tv-drama-drops-as-advocates-call-for-abc-sbs-investment">produced by the ABC</a>.</p> 
<p>Now, according to the government, new quotas will apply to streaming services “with more than one million Australian subscribers”, who will need to “invest at least 10% of their total expenditure for Australia – on new local drama, children’s, documentary, arts and educational programs”.</p>
