<h1>When trains are pricier than planes, there’s a heavy social, financial and environmental cost</h1>

<p>If I want to get from Barcelona to London, I face what should be a simple choice: either I take the plane, and pump out about 280kg of pollution that heats the planet, or the train, and spew just 8kg.</p> <p>That is not the calculation travellers are presented with, nor is it the one they care about most. Because while the plane ticket would cost €15, an analysis from Greenpeace found this summer, the train ticket would cost a galling €389.</p> <p>That 25-fold difference in price is an extreme example of a barrier that crops up across the continent – and frustrates even the most climate-conscious travellers. This week, we’ll be looking at how Europe runs a system that favours planes over trains in spite of its green ambitions.</p> <p>But first, this week’s climate headlines.</p> <h2><strong>Essential reads</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/22/climate-disasters-2025-cost">Climate disasters in first half of 2025 costliest ever on record, research shows</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/22/global-use-of-coal-hit-record-high-in-2024">Global use of coal hit record high in 2024</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/17/overconsumption-before-after-images-tech-harm-planet">Overconsumption and ruin: before and after images visualise how tech could harm our planet</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>In focus</strong></h2>    <p>International rail travel is not new to Europe. The first tracks that crossed borders opened nearly 200 years ago, as coal-burning steam engines spread the Industrial Revolution through the continent and enabled the mass movement of people and goods.</p> <p>But the rise of cars and planes have made train journeys less appealing, and today, even as Europe seeks to clean up its economy, the railway system is burdened by high prices and fragmented systems. In some countries – such as Germany, which long distance travellers will struggle to avoid – chronic underinvestment has led to frequent delays that can ruin a holiday or work trip.</p> <p>Some of these problems seem easily fixable. When I travel from Berlin to London, a journey I make a few times a year, I have to book two separate tickets. If the first trains are late, which they often are, and I miss my connection, I don’t have the right to just jump on the next available train across the Channel. (There are, however, two commercial arrangements between European rail operators that could protect travellers in such cases.)</p> <p>Similar issues occur at the booking stage, with many operators blocking external platforms from selling their tickets, according to nonprofit Transport and Environment (T&amp;E). Some even hide competitors’ offers on their own sites.</p> <p>This already puts people off climate-friendly transport. A <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/booking-headache-deters-almost-two-in-three-long-distance-rail-travellers-new-poll-finds">YouGov poll</a> commissioned by T&amp;E and published on Wednesday found more than 60% of long-distance rail travellers have avoided journeys because booking is a hassle, while 43% would use rail more if booking online were easier.</p> <p>The EU has promised to address these issues with a single ticketing regulation, which is to be proposed before the end of the year – essentially, allowing you to book the cheapest route with just one click – but customers and green groups are still frustrated that little is being done to help trains compete with planes on price.</p> <p>The Greenpeace <a href="https://greenpeace.at/uploads/2025/08/greenpeace-analysis-flight-vs-trains-2025.pdf">study</a> this summer looked at 109 cross-border routes in Europe and found that trains beat planes on just 39% of routes – a small improvement since they first ran the analysis two years ago. In France, Spain and the UK, trains were more expensive than flights on more than 90% of the cross-border routes they examined.</p> <p>Why is it so much cheaper to fly than take the train? A big reason is tax. Unlike drivers and train travellers, fliers do not have to pay tax on jet fuel, and plane tickets are mostly exempt from VAT.</p> <p>Transport scientists have found that removing the exorbitant subsidies that the aviation industry enjoys would help level the playing field and free up public money to invest in crumbling railways. They have also suggested policies such as frequent flier levies – which increase the tax on each subsequent flight a person takes in a year – could spread the burden so business travellers and extreme jet-setters shoulder most of the costs.</p> <p>Much of the motivation for this is to address the societal costs that flying brings. If you factor in the damage that planet-heating pollution does to economies – from hotter heatwaves to stronger tropical cyclones – then aviation becomes even less attractive for a government to prop up. The UN-backed Corsia system to offset and reduce emissions, which becomes mandatory in 2027, addresses only a fraction of these costs.</p> <p>Think about it another way. Last year, a study pegged the “social cost of carbon” at about €244 per ton. If trains and planes factored in the social cost of carbon, a train from Barcelona to London would cost just couple more euros, but it would make the flight nearly five times more expensive.From that perspective, the question is less, “Why are flights so cheap?” and more, “Who actually pays for them?”</p> <p><em>• To read the complete version of this newsletter – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-down-to-earth-newsletter-our-free-environmental-email">subscribe to receive Down to Earth</a> in your inbox every Thursday.</em></p> <p>• This article was amended on 24 October 2025 to add some clarifying information regarding the commercial arrangements in place in the event of missed connections between different European rail operators.</p>
