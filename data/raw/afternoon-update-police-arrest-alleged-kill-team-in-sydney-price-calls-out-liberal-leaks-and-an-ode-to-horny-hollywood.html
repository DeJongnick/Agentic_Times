<p>Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update.</p> 
<p>New South Wales police have charged three men with conspiracy to commit murder, alleging they were a hired “hit team” arrested while on their way to kill a man near a Sydney daycare centre.</p> 
<p>Just before 4pm on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/08/alleged-kill-team-charged-after-arrest-en-route-to-hit-near-sydney-daycare">police conducted “high-risk” stops of two vehicles</a> in Revesby using less than lethal rounds and arrested the three men, aged 18, 19 and 26. A search of the cars allegedly found two firearms, balaclavas, body-worn cameras and two jerry cans filled with petrol. A third firearm was later found in another unoccupied vehicle allegedly linked to the men.</p> 
<p>“This was a calculated and coordinated intervention that stopped what we will allege was a planned killing nearby a daycare centre – a deeply concerning scenario,” Scott Cook, an assistant commissioner and state crime commander for NSW police, said in a statement. Cook said the location of the alleged murder attempt could have resulted in “so much collateral damage”.</p> 
<p>The three men were refused bail and were due to appear in Bankstown local court later on Wednesday.</p>
