<p>The weight-loss drug semaglutide cuts the risk of heart attack or stroke regardless of how many kilograms people lose, the largest study of its kind has found.</p> <p>However, shrinking waist size – a sign of less belly fat – was linked to better heart outcomes, according to the research.</p> <p>The findings, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01375-3/fulltext">published in the Lancet</a>, suggest drugs could have wider benefits for patients beyond weight loss so should not be restricted to the most obese patients.</p> <p>Researchers set out to examine the additional benefits of semaglutide, which is the main ingredient of the weight-loss drug Wegovy.</p> <p>The select trial, led by University College London (UCL), looked at whether or not people taking the drug went on to suffer a “major adverse cardiac event” – including heart disease deaths, heart attacks or strokes.</p> <p>They examined data on 17,604 people aged 45 and over who were either overweight or obese.</p> <p>Half of the people taking part in the study – which took place across 41 countries – were given weekly injections of semaglutide. The other half were given a dummy drug, known as a placebo.</p> <p>Previous analysis of the data found that semaglutide reduced the risk of major adverse cardiac events by 20%. Researchers have now found the benefit was apparent regardless of how much weight people lost while taking the drug.</p> <p>Academics said the findings suggested there were multiple ways the drug could benefit the heart, rather than the protective effect achieved solely by weight loss alone.</p> <p>They found that even people who were only mildly overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) score of 27 – the average BMI score for UK adults – experienced similar benefits to those who had the highest BMI scores.</p> <p>The benefits were also largely independent of how much weight people lost in the first four months of treatment.</p> <p>However, researchers did notice a difference between shrinking waistlines, measured by waist circumference, and heart benefits.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01375-3/fulltext">Writing in the Lancet</a>, they said that an “estimated 33% of the observed benefit on major adverse cardiovascular events was mediated through waist circumference reduction”.</p> <p>The lead author, Prof John Deanfield, of UCL’s Institute of Cardiovascular Science, said: “Abdominal fat is more dangerous for our cardiovascular health than overall weight and therefore it is not surprising to see a link between reduction in waist size and cardiovascular benefit.</p> <p>“However, this still leaves two-thirds of the heart benefits of semaglutide unexplained. These findings reframe what we think this medication is doing.</p> <p>“It is labelled as a weight-loss jab but its benefits for the heart are not directly related to the amount of weight lost – in fact, it is a drug that directly affects heart disease and other diseases of ageing.”</p> <p>He added: “This work has implications for how semaglutide is used in clinical practice.</p> <p>“You don’t have to lose a lot of weight and you don’t need a high BMI to gain cardiovascular benefit. If your aim is to reduce cardiovascular disease, restricting its use to a limited time only and for those with the highest BMIs doesn’t make sense.</p> <p>“At the same time, the benefits need to be weighed against potential side-effects. Investigations of side-effects become especially important given the broad range of people this medicine and others like it could help.”</p>
