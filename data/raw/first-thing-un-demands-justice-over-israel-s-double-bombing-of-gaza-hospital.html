<p>Good morning.</p> 
<p>The UN has demanded that Israel’s investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza, including its “double-tap” bombing of Nasser hospital, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/26/un-demands-investigations-into-gaza-hospital-killings">which killed 20 people</a> including five journalists, yield results and ensure accountability.</p> 
<p>“There needs to be justice,” said Thameen Al-Kheetan, the spokesperson for the UN’s human rights office. He added that the number of journalists killed in Gaza raised many questions about the targeting of media workers.</p> 
<p>Israel twice struck Nasser hospital on Monday, the last functioning public hospital in southern Gaza. Witnesses said the second strike came just as rescue crews and journalists arrived to evacuate the wounded 15 minutes after the first bombing, killing first responders and media workers. The “double-tap” strike killed journalists working for Reuters, Associated Press and Al Jazeera, as well as independent journalists.</p>

 <li><p><strong>What does international law say about the attack?</strong> It may constitute a war crime on many fronts, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/israel-attack-gaza-hospital-may-constitute-war-on-many-fronts">writes</a> the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont. “What is striking about this incident is that each individual element – the targeting of a working hospital, of journalists and rescue workers, of injured civilians already under treatment – would be expected to draw accusations of a war crime in its own right,” he writes.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Who were the five Palestinian journalists killed?</strong> Their names were Moaz Abu Taha, Mariam Abu Dagga, Mohammad Salama, Ahmed Abu Aziz and Hussam al-Masri, and you can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/26/he-loved-his-work-deeply-profiles-of-five-palestinian-journalists-killed-in-gaza-airstrike">read their stories here</a>. “He loved his work deeply,” said Abu Taha’s brother Adly.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Meanwhile, what</strong><strong> is happening in Israel?</strong> Tens of thousands of people took part in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/26/israeli-protesters-stage-day-of-disruption-calling-for-end-to-war-in-gaza">demonstrations</a> on Tuesday, blocking highways on a “day of disruption” that aimed to push Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing a deal to end the war and call off plans to attack Gaza City.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to sue Trump administration over its attempt to fire her</strong></h2> 
<p>The Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/trump-fires-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook">sue the Trump administration</a> for its attempt to fire her over unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud, her attorney has said.</p> 
<p>Donald Trump announced he was firing Cook on Monday night, in an extraordinary move that marks the latest escalation in the US president’s attack on the central bank’s independence.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What has Cook’s attorney said?</strong> Trump has “no authority” to remove Cook from the Fed’s board of governors, he said a statement. “His attempt to fire her … lacks any factual or legal basis.” In the meantime, Cook plans to stay put on the Fed’s powerful board of governors and rate-setting policy committee.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Trump imposes 50% tariff on India as punishment for buying Russian oil</strong></h2> 
<p>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/trump-tariff-india-russian-oil-purchase">imposed 50% tariffs</a> on most US imports from India, following through on a threat to punish one of the world’s largest economies for buying discounted Russian oil.</p> 
<p>The tariffs, which came into effect just after midnight on Wednesday in Washington, risk inflicting significant damage on the Indian economy and further disrupting global supply chains.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What</strong><strong> is the reaction </strong><strong>in India?</strong> Ministers there argue it has been unjustly singled out for its trade relationship with Russia and officials caution the country will probably work more closely with Moscow and Beijing – and drift further from Washington – as a result.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Meanwhile, what is the latest on the Ukrainian frontline?</strong> Ukraine acknowledged for the first time on Tuesday that Russia’s army had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/27/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-troops-inside-dnipropetrovsk-region-ukraine-says">entered the Dnipropetrovsk region</a>, a central administrative area previously spared from intense fighting.</p></li>
