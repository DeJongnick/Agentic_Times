 <li><p><strong>Ukraine could buy up to 150 Gripen fighter jets from Sweden, paid for using frozen Russian assets</strong>, under a deal agreed on Wednesday. Ukraine already has US-made F-16 and French-made Mirage 2000 fighter jets. The Gripen has long been vaunted as <strong>more practical for Ukrainian battlefield conditions</strong> – being built, for example, to take off and land on civilian roads as well as runways so that it can fight from dispersed locations rather than just airfields. <strong>The Swedish PM, Ulf Kristersson, said financing of the procurement could come via frozen Russian assets</strong> held in western countries and from allied nations in the “coalition of the willing”. “We fully realise it’s a long road ahead of us … But from today we are committed to exploring all the possibilities in providing Ukraine with a large amount of Gripen fighters in the future.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, said his military aimed to receive and start using Gripen jets next year</strong>, adding: “For our army, Gripens are a priority. It is about money, about manoeuvres.” Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London’s Royal United Services Institute, said the Gripen E would “hypothetically represent a significantly more capable medium-weight fighter” than Ukraine’s existing fleet because of its <strong>radar, internal electronic warfare systems and ability to carry and launch long-range Meteor air-to-air missiles</strong>. Sweden has ordered 60 of the latest Gripen E model and Saab is increasing capacity in its Linkoping plant aiming to produce 20 to 30 planes per year, as well as building them in Brazil.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/us-sanctions-russia-oil-vladimir-putin-refusal-ukraine-war">Donald Trump announced sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil</a>, Russia’s two largest oil companies, the European Union also agreed to impose new measures to curb Moscow’s oil and gas revenues</strong>. The EU package is its 19th since the 2022 invasion. It will bring forward a ban on the import of liquefied natural gas from Russia by a year to the start of 2027. It also blacklists more than 100 additional tankers from Moscow’s “shadow fleet”, and imposes controls on the travel of Russian diplomats suspected of espionage.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The EU package is scheduled to be formally adopted on Thursday just before <strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, joins EU leaders at a summit in Brussels</strong>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/this-is-europe-coalition-of-the-willing-reparations-loan">Jennifer Rankin writes</a> that as well as the 19th package of sanctions, EU leaders are expected to declare “unwavering support” for Ukraine’s independence and endorse plans for a €140bn (£122bn/$162bn) loan to Kyiv based on Russia’s frozen assets.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy has voiced support for Donald Trump’s proposal for Ukraine and Russia to freeze the war at the current frontlines</strong>, calling it “a good compromise”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/zelenskyy-calls-trumps-proposal-to-freeze-war-at-current-frontlines-good-compromise">Pjotr Sauer reports</a>, even as the Ukrainian president acknowledged Moscow had made clear it would not accept the arrangement.</p></li>
