  <p><strong>In Australia, the conservative opposition </strong><strong> appears likely to support any government decision to send Australian peacekeepers to Ukraine if the US-European talks lead to peace.</strong></p> 
  <p>When Labor prime minister <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> previously said Australia would consider requests to join a peacekeeping force, then opposition leader Peter Dutton dismissed it as a “thought bubble”. But Dutton’s successor, <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>, has now indicated the opposition is open to Australia joining a global effort in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>A Ley spokesperson said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We will work constructively with the government in our national interest when it comes to our international relationships. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The opposition unequivocally supported Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s illegal and immoral invasion, the spokesperson added.</p> 
  <p>Australian Associated Press also reports that Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, <strong>Vasyl Myroshnychenko</strong>, said bipartisanship on his country’s security was vital.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I welcome that decision, I think that’s a very smart decision. We’ve traditionally had that bipartisan support and I think it’s the right thing to do.</p>

  <p>British prime minister Keir Starmer has given some more comments, hailing “real progress” at the summit.</p> 
  <p>Speaking after the event, <strong>Starmer</strong> <strong>described the talks as “good and constructive”</strong>, adding: “There was a real sense of unity between the European leaders that were there, and President Trump and President Zelensky.”</p> 
  <p>The prime minister highlighted “two material outcomes” from the talks, firstly that the coalition of the willing “will now work with the US” on security guarantees.</p> 
  <p>“That’s really important for security in Ukraine, for security in Europe, and for security in the UK,” Starmer said.</p> 
  <p>“The other material outcome was the agreement that there will now be a bilateral agreement between President Putin and President Zelensky, that was after a phone call between President Trump and President Putin during the course of this afternoon, followed by a trilateral that will add in Trump.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That is a recognition of the principle that on some of these issues, whether it’s territory or the exchange of prisoners, or the very serious issue of the return of children, that is something where Ukraine must be at the table.</p> 
   <p>These were the two outcomes that were the most important coming out of today. They’re positive outcomes, there was a real sense of unity. We’ve made real progress today.</p>

  <p>Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/16/melania-trump-vladimir-putin-letter-donald">raised the plight of children in Ukraine</a> and Russia in a personal letter to Russian president Vladimir Putin, two White House officials said on Friday when Trump met Putin at a summit in Alaska. Trump hand-delivered that letter to Putin.</p> 
  <p>As many as 35,000 Ukrainian children are still missing and thought to be held in Russia or Russian-occupied territories, according to an American team of experts, with families saying they are being forced to take desperate and risky measures to try to rescue them.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It’s 10.25pm in Washington DC and here’s a recap of the day’s key events so far:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>A Ukraine peace deal appeared far from imminent after Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders met Donald Trump at the White House and the US president ruled out a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war</strong>, despite last week warning Moscow of “very severe consequences” if Vladimir Putin didn’t agree to halt the fighting. Trump said while sitting with the leaders on Monday: “All of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace. Maybe something like that could happen. As of this moment, it’s not happening.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump told Zelenskyy the US would help guarantee Ukraine’s security in any deal to end the war</strong>, though the extent of any assistance was not immediately clear. “I believe this is a major step forward,” Zelenskyy said, also saying security guarantees for Ukraine would probably be worked out within 10 days.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has agreed to face-to-face talks with Zelenskyy, according to Trump and European leaders, but Russia has not confirmed any meeting</strong>. Trump claimed on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115052030103944534">his Truth Social platform</a> that arrangements were under way for a Zelenskyy-Putin meeting and, later, a trilateral meeting between the two along with Trump. The Russian president has previously resisted a one-on-one meeting with Zelenskyy. Ukraine’s leader said it was ready to meet with Russia in “any format” and that territorial issues are “something we will leave between me and Putin”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>German chancellor Friedrich Merz said Putin told Trump in a call during the White House meeting that he was ready to meet<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy"> Zelenskyy</a> “within the next two weeks”</strong>. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Putin and Trump only discussed the “idea” of direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Monday’s phone call and that Putin told Trump he was open to the “idea” of direct talks with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump described his meeting with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Zelenskyy</a> and the leaders of Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Finland, the European Union and Nato as “a very good, early step</strong> for a war that has been going on for almost four years”. He also wrote on social media that “everyone is very happy about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>French president Emmanuel Macron called for stepping up sanctions against Russia if Vladimir Putin does not move forward on peace with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</strong>German chancellor Friedrich Merz says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> should not be forced to surrender its Donbas region to Russia in talks, likening it to the US giving up Florida. Finnish president Alexander Stubb said the main agreement from the White House meeting was that the killing had to end and that it remained to be seen if Putin had the courage to meet Zelenskyy. “Putin is rarely to be trusted,” Stubb said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump, however, seemed clearly swayed by Putin from their talks in Alaska last Friday and echoed the Russian president’s talking points</strong>, saying several times on Monday that ending the war was “up to” both Zelenskyy and Putin – rather than just Putin, the invader. Trump also said: “We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact – that means the war zone<em>.”</em></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ukraine will promise to buy $100bn of US weapons financed by Europe as part of a deal </strong>to get guarantees from the US for its security if there is a peace settlement with Russia, according to news reports.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>In stark contrast to the heated exchange during Zelenskyy’s first trip to Trump’s White House in February, the Ukrainian president’s charm offensive this time around looked to pay off</strong>, allowing him to emerge unscathed. Zelenskyy – who wore a black military-style suit and presented a letter from his wife, Olena Zelenska, for Melania Trump in response to her letter to Putin – said this meeting with Trump was his “best” so far.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Here’s a fresh video of the proceedings in the White House as Donald Trump ruled out a ceasefire in Ukraine while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> and his European allies visited the US president.</strong></p> 
  <p>Trump said he had called Vladimir Putin and begun arrangements for a meeting between the Russian president and Ukrainian leader, also saying that “all of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire ... as of this moment it’s not happening”.</p> 
  <p>However, the leaders of France and Germany refused to accept defeat on the issue, with German chancellor Friedrich Merz insisting “we would all like to see a ceasefire” and he could not imagine the next meeting taking place without one, and French president Emmanuel Macron also backing the idea of a truce as a “necessity”.</p>

  <p><strong>French president Emmanuel Macron has called for stepping up sanctions against Russia if Vladimir Putin does not move forward on peace with Ukraine.</strong></p> 
  <p>“President Trump believes we can get an agreement and believes that President Putin also wants a peace accord,” Macron told reporters after the talks at the White House.</p> 
  <p>“But if at the end this process is met by refusal, we are also ready to say that we need to increase sanctions.”</p> 
  <p>Macron pointed to recent secondary sanctions imposed by the Trump administration on India, a major buyer of Russian energy as western nations cut back due to sanctions over Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Macron said the secondary sanctions on India had “had a lot of effects”, Agence France-Presse reports.</p> 
  <p>Over the weekend, Trump publicly again pressured Ukraine to concede territory, siding with Putin and not Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has insisted on defending all territory that Russia has taken by force.</p> 
  <p>Asked by reporters if Trump had said that concessions were necessary before any US security guarantees to Ukraine, Macron said: “No, that wasn’t discussed at all. We’re well away from that.”</p> 
  <p> He said he hoped Russia and Ukraine would resume contact “in the coming days” with a potential three-way summit involving Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy “in two to three weeks”.</p>

  <p><strong>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> touted his bona fides as the so-called “peacemaker-in-chief” during talks over Ukraine at the White House, he made two big claims: that he wants peace deals instead of ceasefires, and that he has ended six wars since he became president.</strong></p> 
  <p>But as <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/roth-andrew">Andrew Roth</a></strong> explains, in Trump’s haste to hammer out a peace deal in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, he is playing fast and loose with the truth.</p>

   <p>On the subject of ceasefires, by Trump’s own admission, he has often been seeking them in these conflicts. Now, he has sought to rewrite the record, piling pressure on Ukraine.</p> 
   <p>Trump’s declaration that he was not seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine came after last week’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/15/trump-putin-alaska-meeting-ukraine">meeting Vladimir Putin in Alaska</a>, where the Russian president initially demanded that Ukraine cede control over territory in the country’s southeast before negotiating a ceasefire.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">The day so far</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>At the time of writing, Donald Trump has ruled out a ceasefire in Ukraine</strong> as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> and his European allies visited the White House to push for US-backed security guarantees as part of any long-term peace deal. The US president, who only last week warned Russia of “very severe consequences” if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> failed to agree to a halt the fighting, made clear today that he had reversed his position. Later, sitting with the other European leaders in the east room, he acknowledged: “All of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace. Maybe something like that could happen. As of this moment, it’s not happening.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>But some of the European allies refused to accept defeat on the ceasefire issue</strong>, mindful that the lack of one allows Putin more time to wage his war of aggression. Friedrich Merz, the chancellor of Germany, insisted that “we would all like to see a ceasefire” and he could not imagine the next meeting taking place without one. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, also backed the idea of a “truce” as a “necessity”, adding: “We all support this idea.” By way of strategy, the leaders led with praise and gratitude for Trump, and several notably mirrored his language (for example, saying they wanted to “stop the killing”) and stressing the importance of protecting Ukraine’s children, referencing his wife Melania’s letter sent over the weekend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/16/melania-trump-vladimir-putin-letter-donald">to Putin urging him to consider children impacted by the war</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump, though, was clearly swayed by Putin in Alaska and echoing his talking points</strong>. He said several times today that ending the war was “up to” both Zelenskyy and Putin (as opposed to just Putin, the invader). Ominously for Ukraine, Trump also added: “We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact – that means the war zone<em>.”</em></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>But he said Putin had accepted there would be security guarantees for Ukraine</strong> <strong>as part of a peace deal and that</strong> <strong>the US would help guarantee Ukraine’s safety</strong>, which Kyiv has long said would be essential for a lasting peace. “When it comes to security, there’s going to be a lot of help,” Trump said. He declined to rule out sending US troops to Ukraine, noting it would be a discussion point with European leaders. But he also made it clear that European countries would be expected to mostly carry the burden, saying: “They are a first line of defence because they’re there. But we’ll help them out.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Several of the leaders emphasised the importance of the security guarantees to deter Russia from attacking again.</strong> Macron said: <em>“</em>The first one is clearly a credible Ukrainian army for the years and decades to come.” Europe was also clear about carrying its “fair share” of the burden, he said, “so you can count on this as we can continue<em>”. </em>Giorgia Meloni, the Italian PM, said: <em>‘</em>We will talk about many important topics. The first one is security guarantees, how to be sure that it won’t happen again, which is the precondition of every kind of peace.<em>”</em></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump also expressed hope that the talks with Zelenskyy could lead to a trilateral meeting with Putin</strong>. “I think if everything works out well today we’ll have a [trilateral meeting], and I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.”</p></li> 
   <li><p>And in stark contrast to the infamously heated exchange during Zelenskyy’s first trip to Trump’s White House in February, the Ukrainian president’s charm offensive this time around – which included wearing a black military-style suit and presenting a letter from his wife, Olena Zelenska, for Melania Trump in response to her letter to Putin – seemed to pay off, allowing him to emerge unscathed. But the state of play for Ukraine coming out of today’s meetings remains to be seen, and we’ll bring you more as soon as we get it.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Sketch: All smoke and no fire as Zelenskky emerges unbruised after Trump meet</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>If there was a sign that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> wasn’t going to be immediately voted off the island of the <strong>Donald Trump</strong> diplomacy show, it came early on when a familiar voice commended his choice of attire.</p> 
  <p>“President Zelensky, you look fabulous in that suit,” said Brian Glenn, a pro-Trump pundit and member of the White House press corps, who had attacked him for wearing military fatigues <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-transcript">during the infamous Oval Office meeting in February</a>. “I said the same thing,” Trump added.</p> 
  <p>“You are in the same suit,” Zelenskyy shot back, earning smiles and laughter from the room including the US president. “I changed, you did not.”</p> 
  <figure class="element element-atom"> <gu-atom data-atom-id="48260fac-adbc-4e98-838f-3124fd576361" data-atom-type="media">

    </div>
   </gu-atom> 
  </figure> 
  <p>Thus did Zelenskyy survive his first media appearance at the White House with Trump on Monday as the US president focused less on belittling the leader of a wartime ally than boasting – and in many cases exaggerating – his exploits as a peacemaker in world conflicts.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy, dressed reluctantly in a black military-style suit to appease sticklers for protocol in the White House, largely sat by quietly as Trump claimed to have hammered out peace deals in six wars including one the veteran real estate developer said had taken place in the “Republic of the Condo”.</p> 
  <p>From Trump there was hyperbole about his ability to broker peace deals, digressions to internal US political battles over mail-in ballots, nebulous declarations about how he would end the conflict and evasions over how he would do that without negotiating a ceasefire.</p> 
  <p>But there were no explosions – which meant for Zelenskyy it probably went as well as it could have.</p> 
  <p>He found a far more hospitable welcome from both Trump and <strong>JD Vance</strong>, and he kicked off the meeting with some high-level flattery, thanking Trump profusely for his efforts to end the conflict and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/16/melania-trump-vladimir-putin-letter-donald">praising Melania Trump for sending a letter to Putin about abducted Ukrainian children</a>.</p> 
  <p>There was little detail about the peace deal that Trump wanted to hammer out, except for the fact that he wanted to skip past a ceasefire – too difficult to actually negotiate – and go straight for a peace deal.</p> 
  <p>And yet it appeared that all – or at least most – sides were keen to smooth over their differences in order to <strong>prevent Ukraine as being seen as the main obstruction to peace and of throwing the ball back to Putin</strong>.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Well, the optics of this initial meeting were far friendlier than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-shouting-match-oval-office">the last time</a> these people were all in the Oval Office together, and <strong>Zelenskyy</strong> and the other European leaders will no doubt be very pleased with how suit-gate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/aug/18/ukraine-war-live-update-russia-zelenskyy-washington-trump-europe-meeting-talks-latest-news?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68a365268f0839af25d769e4#block-68a365268f0839af25d769e4">was handled</a>, for example – heck, there was even laughing at times.</p> 
  <p>But despite this lightheartedness, there were some worrying developments for Kyiv. Perhaps most key was <strong>Trump’s</strong> assertion that he’s decided he doesn’t need a ceasefire after all in order to negotiate a peace deal, after spending months demanding one from Russia and threatening sanctions and “severe consequences” if it didn’t comply. Things have clearly changed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/16/love-in-a-cold-climate-putin-romances-trump-in-alaska-with-talk-of-rigged-elections-and-a-trip-to-moscow">after his Alaska summit</a> with <strong>Putin</strong>, who knows the US president wants peace more than anything and has played this up to his advantage by blaming others for being obstacles to ending the war.</p> 
  <p>But there were glimmers of hope for Kyiv, notably Trump saying the US would help guarantee Ukraine’s security in a peace deal, giving Ukraine “very good protection”. Kyiv has long said this would essential for achieving a lasting peace. But Trump remained uncommitted on what level of specific security guarantees the US is willing to support, for instance whether its involvement would include an Article 5-style defence commitment and/or American boots on the ground, and also made clear that most of the burden would fall on Europe.</p> 
  <p>Whether Trump can now be convinced once again by Zelenskyy and the Europeans that the onus is on Russia to end its war, and not on Ukraine to give up territory, in order to achieve peace remains to be seen.</p>

  <p>In a post on social media published shortly before going into the White House, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>Our main goal is a reliable and lasting peace for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe.</strong> And it is important that the momentum of all our meetings lead to precisely this result. <strong>We understand that we shouldn’t expect Putin to voluntarily abandon aggression and new attempts at conquest.

   <p><em><strong>We must stop the killings,</strong> and I thank our partners who are working toward this and ultimately toward a reliable and dignified peace. Together with the leaders of Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, the European Commission, and the Nato Secretary General, <strong>we coordinated our positions</strong> ahead of the meeting with President Trump. Ukraine is ready for a real truce and for establishing a new security architecture. We need peace.”</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Poland set to miss summit amid conflict between president, government on foreign policy</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>On the European side of the table, there will be one notable absence as Poland will not have a representative</strong>, <strong>despite being part of the previous rounds of consultations</strong> with Trump, including days before the Alaska summit last week.</p> 
  <p>Since his election, the country’s new nationalist and Trump-backed president, <strong>Karol Nawrocki</strong>, has been at loggerheads with the pro-European coalition government led by former European Council president, <strong>Donald Tusk</strong>, including over who owns the relationship with the US. </p> 
  <p>Poland’s constitution says somewhat vaguely that:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>The President of the Republic <strong>shall cooperate</strong> with the prime minister and the appropriate minister in respect of foreign policy.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Ahead of last week’s Alaska summit, <strong>there had been some confusion as to who would take part in the preparatory calls because the two disagreed over their constitutional roles.</strong> Eventually Tusk joined the internal European call and the debrief with the “Coalition of the Willing”, but it was his staunch political rival, Nawrocki, who represented Poland at the main call with Trump.</p> 
  <p>Ahead of today’s meeting, it was the foreign minister, <strong>Radosław Sikorski</strong>, who represented Poland at the preparatory call in the “Coalition of the Willing” format over the weekend, further raising some eyebrows.</p> 
  <p>Still, on Sunday, Nawrocki’s spokesperson appeared to be suggesting that the president was considering joining the European leaders’ trip to the US, and he promised a further update by the end of the day. But <strong>no official confirmation came through at all.</strong></p> 
  <p>The <strong>two camps eventually ended up pointing fingers at each other</strong> on Monday after it emerged that there <strong>would be no Polish representation after all.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking at a ceremony in Warsaw, <strong>Nawrocki said he was clear in his conversations with Trump about his mistrust of Vladimir Putin and Russia</strong>, but argued that it was the government’s role to participate in this particular format as Tusk has been attending previous summits of the coalition.</p> 
  <p>He added that <strong>he was the only European leader with an upcoming bilateral meeting with Trump at the White House</strong>, too – on 3 September – and he would raise these issues then.</p> 
  <p>But <strong>Poland’s foreign minister Sikorski was quick to pick up on this point</strong>, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“I inform you that it is the President of the United States who issues invitations to meetings at the White House, with whom <strong>Polish representatives of the Maga movement, as well as President @NawrockiKn personally, have privileged relations.</strong> </em></p> 
   <p><em>I ask that they make use of these relations for the benefit of Poland and Europe.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>His comments sparked a further reaction from Nawrocki’s foreign policy aide <strong>Marcin Przydacz</strong>, who said that as Sikorski was part of the pre-meeting call on Sunday, it was up to him to get Poland to join the meeting, with the president sticking to his original plans for next month’s visit instead.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">European leaders want to 'flesh out details' of security guarantees for Ukraine</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>British officials said <strong>the leaders planned to use that meeting to flesh out details of the Nato-style guarantees which were promised over the weekend by Steve Witkoff</strong>, the president’s Ukraine envoy. </p> 
  <p>Those briefed on the meetings <strong>say however they do not expect a deal to be signed on Monday</strong>, describing the flurry of diplomatic activity as a “step towards” eventual peace.</p> 
  <p>A Downing Street spokesperson said on Monday: “<strong>We welcome [the fact] that the US is prepared to give security guarantees.</strong> That is going to be an important aspect of the discussions, both today and in the period ahead.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“For the coalition of the willing to be successful in deterring Putin – once we’ve got to a peace – from coming again, the United States’ involvement in providing that deterrence is actually critical.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The person added: <strong>“President Putin has never been serious about peace,”</strong> adding that the UK could still back further sanctions on Moscow despite Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, casting doubt that more sanctions would work. </p> 
  <p><strong>Starmer has been at the forefront of efforts to put together an alliance of countries who are willing to commit troops and other resources to defend Ukraine</strong> should Russia try to invade again, but has always said such a plan would require US support to work. </p> 
  <p>British officials were delighted therefore when <strong>Witkoff told CNN over the weekend that the US and Europe could “effectively offer Article 5-like language to cover a security guarantee”</strong>, referring to Nato’s principle that an attack on one member is an attack on all.</p> 
  <p>Starmer and his ministers have lavished praise on Trump since his meeting in Alaska with the Russian president, despite reports that the US president had backed a plan which would allow Russia to seize Ukrainian territory it does not currently occupy.</p> 
  <p><strong>Downing Street would not comment on territorial disputes on Monday</strong>, saying the subject was one for Zelenskyy to decide, but Starmer’s spokesperson did indicate the UK was no longer pushing for an immediate ceasefire while talks continue (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/aug/18/ukraine-war-live-update-russia-zelenskyy-washington-trump-europe-meeting-talks-latest-news?page=with%3Ablock-68a312558f08adf7c3a587ec#block-68a312558f08adf7c3a587ec">14:09</a>).</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Meloni sees 'glimmer of hope' from Trump-Putin talks, focuses on security guarantees</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in Rome</em></p> 
  <p>The Italian prime minister <strong>Giorgia Meloni</strong>, who has long demonstrated an affinity with the US president, Donald Trump, has arrived in Washington, according to the Italian news agency, Ansa.</p> 
  <p>Before leaving Rome, Meloni’s office issued a statement referring to the video conference on Sunday with fellow European leaders, during which <strong>“the importance of continuing to work with the United States to end the conflict and achieve a peace that ensures the sovereignty and security of Ukraine”</strong> was reiterated, while confirming the need to “maintain collective pressure on Russia and ensure solid and credible security guarantees”.</p> 
  <p>On the security guarantees for Ukraine, <strong>Meloni said on Saturday that Trump had highlighted an Italian proposal during his summit with Putin in Anchorage that was “inspired by Nato’s Article 5”.</strong></p> 
  <p>“The starting point of the proposal is <strong>the definition of a collective security clause</strong> that would allow Ukraine to benefit from the support of all its partners, including the USA, ready to take action in case it is attacked again,” Meloni added.</p> 
  <p><strong>Meloni also referred to the Trump-Putin meeting as having “finally” opened up “a glimmer of hope”</strong> on discussions of peace in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Meloni last travelled to Washington in April for a bilateral with Trump. The pair met again in Rome just over a week later for the funeral of <strong>Pope Francis</strong>, before which Trump and the Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> held a brief but symbolic one-to-one talk in St Peter’s Basilica.</p> 
  <p><strong>Meloni was the only European leader to attend Trump’s inauguration</strong> as US president in January, and before that made a flying visit to his Mar-a-Lago golf club.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>UK prime minister <strong>Keir Starmer’s</strong> spokesperson has been speaking to the media in the last half hour, suggesting that <strong>the UK would back a Ukraine peace deal without a ceasefire as a precondition, </strong>PA reported.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>We’ve always said we want to see a sustainable and just peace for Ukraine.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>One that ensures peace returns to Europe and the Ukrainian people can live without fear of attack again, and an agreement that delivers that as soon as possible, but ends the killing and translates that into a lasting peace supported by security guarantees, would be a significantly positive step.”</em></p>

  <p>Pressed on whether that marked a change of position, Starmer’s spokesperson said: </p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>We want to see an end to the killing.</strong> If you can bring about an end to the killing and bring about a sustained peace in one go, then all the better.”</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Germany's Merz finds silver lining in Trump's Alaska summit, but commiting troops continues to divide politicians</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in Berlin</em></p> 
  <p>Germany’s chancellor <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong>, who boarded a dawn flight to Washington on Monday, <strong>had found a silver lining for the Europeans out of the Alaska summit</strong>, saying on Saturday <strong>the United States was ready to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine under a peace deal.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Trump’s pledge, however, was decidedly vague,</strong> as European leaders said at least some US boots would need to be on the ground in Ukraine for the guarantee to carry any weight as a deterrent against further Russian aggression.</p> 
  <p>After Trump advisor <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong> suggested the security <strong>guarantees could be comparable to an Article 5 mutual defence protection within Nato</strong>, <strong>it begged the question whether the Europeans would commit troops of their own for Ukraine.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>At least in Germany, the response appeared muted at best.</strong></p> 
  <p>German vice-chancellor <strong>Lars Klingbeil</strong> told ZDF public television he wouldn’t rule anything out but stopped well-short of a full-throated pledge.</p> 
  <p>“Now <strong>it’s about getting a ceasefire and then we can talk about everything else</strong>,” said Klingbeil, a Social Democrat.</p> 
  <p>But for the foreign minister, <strong>Johann Wadephul</strong> of Merz’s Christian Democrats (CDU), the answer was <strong>a flat no, citing the growing presence of German soldiers in Lithuania</strong> - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/22/germany-anti-russian-defence-nato-lithuania-friedrich-merz">Berlin’s first permanent foreign troop deployment since the second world war.</a></p> 
  <p>“<strong>To do that</strong> (station an armoured brigade in Lithuania) and on top of that station troops in Ukraine <strong>would probably overtax us</strong>,” Wadephul told podcast Table.Today. </p> 
  <p>German <strong>officials attempted to sound bullish ahead of Monday’s meetings in Washington</strong>, underlining the united European front. </p> 
  <p>“Speaking directly with Donald Trump in person will certainly have an impact,” CDU MP <strong>Norbert Röttgen</strong>, a leading voice on foreign policy, told the German edition of Politico. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We see ourselves as Ukraine’s main supporter. <strong>European security is now a European matter</strong> – but we want to keep the Americans on board.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Armin Laschet</strong>, head of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, saw the glass half full after the Alaska talks, noting that the lack of a deal also meant that no one-sided deal was agreed without Ukraine’s president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</strong> </p> 
  <p>Regarding any commitment of German troops as part of a security guarantee, Laschet told Berlin’s Inforadio he did not rule it out but remained guarded.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“You can’t answer the question until you know the conditions. Is it in agreement with the United Nations? Is there a UN mandate? Did Russia agree to it?”</em> </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Moscow must hear: stop,' Zelenskyy says, as he warns against rewarding Russia for war</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy </strong>has offered his response to overnight Russian strikes on Ukraine saying they were <strong>“demonstrative” of Russian intentions</strong> and <strong>showing its “cynical” position on war.</strong></p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“And at this very moment, the Russians are attacking Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, the Sumy region, and Odesa, destroying residential buildings and our civilian infrastructure. </em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>Russians are deliberately killing people, particularly children.</strong> As of now, seven people have been killed as a result of the drone strike in Kharkiv, the youngest being a girl who is only a year and a half old, and dozens have been injured, including children. </em></p> 
   <p><em>In Zaporizhzhia, missile strikes injured 20 people and killed three. My condolences go out to all of the victims’ families and loved ones. </em></p> 
   <p><em>There was also a deliberate Russian strike on an energy facility in Odesa owned by an Azerbaijani company, implying that it was an attack not only on us but also on our relations and energy security.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He also pointed out the obvious context of the attacks:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>They are aware that a meeting is taking place today in Washington that will address the end of the war</strong>. We will have a discussion with President Trump about key issues. </em></p> 
   <p><em>Along with Ukraine, the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the European Union, and Nato will participate in the conversation. </em></p> 
   <p><em>Everyone seeks dignified peace and true security.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In a stark warning about Russia’s intentions, <strong>Zelenskyy also said that “the Russian war machine continues to destroy lives despite everything,”</strong> as “Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts".”</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“That is precisely <strong>why we are seeking assistance to put an end to the killings.</strong> </em></p> 
   <p><em>That is why reliable security guarantees are required. </em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>That is why Russia should not be rewarded for its participation in this war.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>The war must be ended. </em></p> 
   <p><em>And <strong>it is Moscow that must hear the word: ‘Stop.’</strong>”</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Hungary, Ukraine clash over criticism for attack on Russian oil pipeline</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Meanwhile, the <strong>Ukrainian foreign minister clashed with his Hungarian counterpart on social media this morning</strong> after Hungary accused Ukraine of an attack on a Russian oil pipeline.</p> 
  <p>Earlier this morning, <strong>Péter Szijjártó </strong>heavily criticised Ukraine for an attack on a Russian pipeline leading to Hungary, calling it “outrageous” and “unacceptable.”</p> 
  <p>The Hungarian minister said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Ukraine has once again attacked the oil pipeline leading to Hungary, cutting off supplies. This latest strike against our energy security is <strong>outrageous and unacceptable</strong>!</em></p> 
   <p><em>Russian deputy energy minister <strong>Pavel Sorokin</strong> informed me that experts are working to restore the transformer station essential for operating the pipeline, but for now they cannot say when deliveries will resume.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>For 3.5 years Brussels and Kyiv have tried to drag Hungary into the war in Ukraine.</strong> These repeated Ukrainian attacks on our energy supply serve that same purpose.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Let me be clear: <strong>this is not our war.</strong> We have nothing to do with it, and as long as we are in charge, Hungary will stay out of it.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Finally, a reminder to Ukrainian decision-makers: <strong>electricity from Hungary plays a vital role in powering your country …</strong>”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>His comments, including a thinly veiled threat against Ukraine, sparked an immediate reaction from Ukraine’s foreign minister, <strong>Andrii Sybiha</strong>, <strong>telling him to take his complaints to Moscow.</strong></p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Peter, <strong>it is Russia, not Ukraine, who began this war and refuses to end it.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>Hungary has been told for years that Moscow is an unreliable partner.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Despite this, <strong>Hungary has made every effort to maintain its reliance on Russia.</strong> Even after the full-scale war began.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>You can now send your complaints – and threats – to your friends in Moscow.”</strong></em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115047128460078066">one</a> of many posts on social media overnight, US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> claimed that <strong>“president Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to”.</strong></p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> 
   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/18/trump-ukraine-crimea-nato-zelesnkyy-washington-meeting">Trump piles pressure on Zelenskyy before European leaders arrive in Washington</a> </p> 
  </aside> 
  <p>His comments are <strong>likely to alarm European leaders</strong> as they <strong>could signal growing US pressure on Ukraine to accept a deal</strong>, however imperfect or outright bad it is, as Trump is determined to secure a diplomatic success after his meeting with <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> on Friday.</p> 
  <p>We all remember what happened during Zelenskyy’s last visit to the White House – even if US state secretary, Marco Rubio, appeared to play down apparent similarities between the two visit in his TV interview over the weekend.</p> 
  <p>But, even more worringly for Europe, Trump also added:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. <strong>Some things never change!!!</strong>”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This position by Trump appears to <strong>violate one of the European red lines for Ukraine</strong>, saying that Ukraine must not be blocked from deciding about its future.</p> 
  <p>On Saturday, European leaders adopted a statement saying:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“No limitations should be placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries. <strong>Russia cannot have a veto against Ukraine’s pathway to EU and Nato.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>It will be <strong>up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory.</strong> International borders must not be changed by force.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>It’s hard to reconcile the two positions – and there will be some concern that by meeting Zelenskyy first, without the Europeans, Trump could seek to pursue this line even further before he sees a concerted push back from European partners.</p> 
  <p><em>One to watch.</em></p>

  <p>Ukraine’s state emergency service posted videos showing rescuers attempting to break through the rubble to reach a trapped resident, while another showed a floor in flames, AFP reports. </p> 
  <p>“Five people were killed, including a girl aged about one-and-a-half years old,” Ukraine’s prosecution service said.</p> 
  <p>“At least 18 people were wounded and suffered acute shock, including children.”</p> 
  <p>The city near the Russian border was also hit hours earlier by a ballistic missile that wounded at least 11 people, Mayor Igor Terekhov said.</p> 
  <p>Russia also struck the southern Odesa region with drones early Monday, sparking a fire at a fuel facility, regional governor Oleg Kiper said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Opening summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared “Russia must end this war” as he arrived in Washington DC ahead of crucial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/17/european-leaders-to-join-zelenskyy-washington-meeting-trump-ukraine-russia">talks with Donald Trump</a> over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>A host of European leaders will join Zelenskyy on Monday for the summit as they seek to provide a counterpoint to Vladimir Putin’s arguments following his talks with the US president on Friday.</p> 
  <p>The leaders – British prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian PM Giorgia Meloni and Finnish president Alexander Stubb – cleared their diaries to fly to the US at short notice, which is seen as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/17/zelenskyy-faces-daunting-trip-to-the-white-house-but-this-time-he-wont-be-alone">a measure of how alarmed they were</a> by Friday’s Trump-Putin summit in Anchorage.</p> 
  <p>After the Alaska talks Trump reportedly endorsed the Kremlin’s plan to end the war in Ukraine, including Kyiv <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/16/ukraine-russia-peace-deal-donbas-region">giving up territory</a> that Russia has been unable to seize and no ceasefire until a final deal has been agreed.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy said in a <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1957271398902039032">post on X</a> after arriving in Washington DC late on Sunday that he was grateful to Trump for the invitation and “we all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably”. He also said that “peace must be lasting”.</p> 
  <p>“Russia must end this war, which it itself started,” Zelenskyy said. “And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.”</p> 
  <p>Here are some of the latest developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy met European leaders in Brussels earlier on Sunday and reiterated Ukraine’s stance on land swaps</strong>, saying on X: “Ukraine’s constitution makes it impossible to give up or trade land. Since the territorial issue is so important, it should be discussed only by the leaders of Ukraine and Russia at the trilateral – Ukraine, the US, Russia. So far, Russia gives no sign this will happen, and if Russia refuses, new sanctions must follow.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ahead of Monday’s peace talks in the US, Emmanuel Macron said that in order to have a “lasting peace deal for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, Ukraine needs a strong army”. </strong>He added that European allies want “Ukraine’s territorial integrity to be respected” and that “Ukraine must be represented in any talks on Ukraine’s future”. The French president also said that “our goal for tomorrow’s talks is to present a united front between Ukraine and its European allies”. The Washington talks will also be attended by the European Commission president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ursula-von-der-leyen">Ursula von der Leyen</a>, and Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy has hailed the decision to offer security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal</strong> as he prepared to meet Trump. “Security guarantees, as a result of our joint work, must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air and at sea, and must be developed with Europe’s participation,” the Ukrainian president said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>In announcing his visit to Washington, Keir Starmer praised Trump for his “efforts to end Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine”.</strong> At the same time, the British PM reasserted Europe’s red lines, saying the “path to peace” could not be decided without Zelenskyy and that Russia should be “squeezed” with further sanctions. Starmer has deliberately sought to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/17/keir-starmer-curious-relationship-trump-ukraine-talks-zelenskyy-russia">position himself as a leader who can get along with Trump</a> while consistently stressing the red lines over any peace plan.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The US secretary of state, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, said Russia and Ukraine were both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/17/rubio-trump-putin-russia-ukraine-war">“going to have to make concessions</a>”</strong> for there to be a peaceful resolution to the war. In interviews on Sunday Rubio said the talks in Alaska had “made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement – but there remains some big areas of disagreement”. “We’re still a long ways off,” Rubio added. “We’re not at the precipice of a peace agreement. We’re not at the edge of one. But I do think progress was made and towards one.” He declined to go into specific areas of agreement or disagreement.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Putin had agreed that the US and European allies could offer Ukraine a Nato-style, “Article 5-like” security guarantee</strong> as part of an eventual deal to end the war. Witkoff added that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> had agreed to unspecified concessions on five Ukrainian regions central to the war, particularly the eastern Donetsk province. “We agreed to robust security guarantees that I would describe as gamechanging,” he said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy to international organisations in Vienna, said early on Monday that Russia agreed that any future peace agreement must provide security guarantees</strong> to Kyiv, but added that Russia “has equal right to expect that Moscow will also get efficient security guarantees”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>European Union council president Antonio Costa said he “welcomed the United States’ willingness to participate in providing security guarantees to Ukraine”. </strong>He also said: “Transatlantic unity is paramount at this moment to achieve a sustainable peace in Ukraine.”</p></li>
