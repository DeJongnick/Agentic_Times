<p>British ministers are “running scared” of Donald Trump in their refusal to force US streaming services to fund more UK-focused shows, the director of the BBC’s Wolf Hall has warned.</p> <p>Peter Kosminsky said a “supine and terrified” government was worried about anything that might upset the “bully in the White House”.</p> <p>He said programmes that spoke truth to power were needed amid global tensions and political division. However, he said important UK dramas were “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/mar/07/senior-tv-producers-shelf-stacking-jobs-uk-industry-crisis">under threat</a> as never before”, with the BBC and ITV struggling to fund shows and cautious about productions that did not appeal to audiences outside Britain.</p> <p>Kosminsky is calling for a 5% levy on streaming companies – to be spent on UK-focused television – and said a similar surcharge had been adopted by 17 other countries.</p> <p>But he accused UK ministers of being afraid to follow suit because of the US president’s threat to impose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/05/fears-trump-foreign-film-tariffs-wipe-out-uk-movie-industry">huge tariffs on films made outside the US</a>.</p>    <p>“We’re running scared of Donald Trump and his tariffs,” he said in a speech last week, reproduced in Radio Times.</p> <p>“The government is so supine and terrified that it’s not prepared to run the risk of upsetting Trump and the delicate trading relationship that they’ve fought so hard – and grovelled so intensely – to achieve.”</p> <p>Kosminsky said ministers could still be pressured into changing course because they were “terrified of swings in public support”.</p> <p>He added: “If you care about public service broadcasting, if you care about the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, I would beg you – get out there and campaign for the government to stand up to the bully in the White House and protect the 100-year tradition of public service broadcasting in this country, of which we are rightly proud, before it is lost for ever.”</p> <p>His speech follows warnings from other television figures, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/mar/18/uk-tv-industry-hit-by-perfect-storm-says-elisabeth-murdoch">including Elisabeth Murdoch</a>, that UK stories could be lost from the small screen as producers and broadcasters turn to shows they can sell internationally, most notably in the US.</p> <p>Kosminsky said the overall effect had been to ensure shows such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/17/three-girls-review-rochdale-child-sexual-abuse-scandal">Three Girls</a>, a drama about the Rochdale child sexual abuse scandal, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/13/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office-why-it-took-a-tv-series-to-bring-the-post-office-scandal-to-light">Mr Bates vs the Post Office</a>, which brought a huge miscarriage of justice to wider public attention, would not be made in today’s market.</p> <p>He said Wolf Hall was turned down by streamers and that senior figures behind the historical drama had voluntarily given up payments.</p> <p>His demand for a 5% levy on companies such as Netflix and Amazon Prime has split the television industry. Other senior figures are pushing for a significant increase in the tax relief, which they say would ensure more shows are economically viable.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: “As the creative industries minister, Sir Chris Bryant, told the culture, media and sport select committee in January, the government has no plans to introduce a levy on streaming services.”</p>
