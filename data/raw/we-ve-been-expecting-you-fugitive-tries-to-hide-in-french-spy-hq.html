<p>A man who fled the scene of a car crash in Paris took the ultimate wrong turn, seeking refuge in the headquarters of France’s spy agency.</p> <p>The driver, who <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/paris-il-fuit-un-accident-de-voiture-et-atterrit-au-siege-de-la-dgse-11-08-2018-7849989.php">reportedly did not have a driving licence</a>, was involved in a crash on the capital’s Périphérique ring road on Friday, scaling a fence several metres high to get off the busy artery.</p> <p>He was apparently unaware he had climbed into the grounds of the General Directorate of External Security (DGSE), according to the Parisien newspaper which first reported the story. </p> <p>He was immediately picked up and arrested.</p> <p>The site, on Boulevard Mortier in north-eastern Paris, is one of the most closely monitored spots in Paris – images of it on Google Street View are blurred. It featured in acclaimed French TV spy thriller Le Bureau des Légendes – starring actors Mathieu Kassovitz and Jean-Pierre Darroussin – which won international acclaim under the English title The Bureau. </p> <p>The suspect’s fence-scaling skills would have served Florida suspect Jennifer Anne Kaufman well on Sunday. She was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/aug/08/herd-of-cows-help-florida-police-corner-a-fleeing-suspect-video">cornered against a fence by cows</a> after she fled her car and ran across a field while being pursued by police. Directing units on the ground, an officer in a police helicopter said: “If you see the large group of cows there, they’re literally following her, chasing her.” Kaufman was later arrested.</p> <p><em>Agence France-Presse contributed to this article</em></p>
