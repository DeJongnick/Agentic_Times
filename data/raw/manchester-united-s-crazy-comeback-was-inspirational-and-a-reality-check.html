<p>Bedlam, pandemonium, ecstasy and simply wow: Manchester United’s three-goal, six-minute (and 34 seconds) blockbuster <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/17/manchester-united-lyon-europa-league-match-report">extra-time comeback from 4-2 down</a> is one for the ages, and a thrilling advertisement for the heart-stopping drama football can generate.</p> <p>Yet if the Harry Maguire header that KO’d Lyon was a last, heroic act of a pell-mell, childhood-like jumpers-for-goalposts victory, it should also clang alarm bells for the fragile unit Ruben Amorim oversees, and cause a serious reality check.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/18/ruben-amorim-to-play-youngsters-premier-league-manchester-united-europa-league">Amorim to play youngsters in Premier League as United focus on Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because streaked through the 5-4 Europa League quarter-final win (7-6 on aggregate) was the latest United collapse provoked by amateurish defending that had Lyon drawing level in the second half from two goals down, then leading 4-2 in the 109th minute with 10 men, after Corentin Tolisso’s sending off in regulation time.</p> <p>Here we see the chaos of Amorim-ball that has scant structure and is akin to the continent’s supposed rising-young-star coach sending out an XI and hoping for the best, while fearing that the worst is (almost) certainly going to occur.</p> <p>Amorim’s hiring was not supposed to be like this. When Erik ten Hag was sacked on 28 October, United were seven points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa. Now, they are in the same 14th place but 17 points behind Manchester City in the fifth position recently confirmed as a Champions League berth. The Portuguese arrived on a ticket of a 3-4-3 shape that has proved non-negotiable despite the flatlining league performance and helter-skelter Europa League campaign.</p> <p>In the latter, a 92nd-minute Bruno Fernandes goal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/23/europa-league-manchester-united-rangers-match-report">was needed to beat Rangers</a> in January. Rasmus Højlund’s 88th-minute strike <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/12/europa-league-viktoria-plzen-manchester-united-match-report">beat Viktoria Plzen</a> in December. Last week, United were leading 2-1 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/10/lyon-manchester-united-europa-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report">in the first leg at Lyon</a> on 88 minutes after Joshua Zirkzee’s header but Rayan Cherki’s 95th-minute shot grabbed a draw. André Onana was culpable but the wider picture was of familiar disarray in United’s area.</p> <p>It is the same in attack. At Old Trafford on Thursday Maguire had to be shunted forward as a makeshift No 9 owing to a lack of alternatives, joining Kobbie Mainoo. The 19-year-old Mainoo scored a calm equaliser (in minute 120) yet shoving an attacking midfielder and centre-back up front is as unsustainable as relying on a 33-year-old Casemiro to be chief creator – the Brazilian was involved in all three of United’s extra-time goals, providing assists for Maguire and Mainoo and winning the penalty scored by Fernandes.</p> <p>The emergency roles for Maguire and Mainoo show up the dismal construction of a squad that contains only two centre-forwards in Zirkzee (who is injured and a more natural No 10) and Højlund, who lacks service from Amorim’s dysfunctional side.</p>    <p>Factor in, too, Amorim’s seemingly quaint man-management of Marcus Rashford, whom he bombed out and who is pulling up trees at Aston Villa on loan.</p> <p>As Maguire says: “You can see that we’re probably short on attackers. We had two in the squad in Garners [Alejandro Garnacho] and Rasmus and they gave everything out there. Garners was on his last legs and he was up and down the pitch numerous times. So if he [Amorim] asks me to go up there, I’m willing to.”</p> <p>Maguire is frank, too, about the slipshod organisation: “I don’t know how I would have felt if I had come here and been speaking after a 4-2 defeat – it’s not even worth trying to think about that. The second half was comfortable; they had a lot of possession but they didn’t create chances. Then they scored the first goal out of nothing, really.”</p> <p>For nothing read Moussa Niakhaté and Alexandre Lacazette being allowed to play head-tennis before Tolisso scored with a third header on 71 minutes.</p> <p>“It was pinball in our box and they managed to put it in,” Maguire says. “With the season that we’ve had, at Old Trafford especially, we started maybe playing a little anxiously, and that’s understandable. But we needed to see out those minutes and be solid, so to end up at 2-2 straight away [through Nicolás Tagliafico in the 77th minute], it was difficult to take.”</p> <p>Cherki’s 104th-minute finish and Lacazette’s penalty on 109 derived from further panic. Maguire says: “Then, in extra time, we obviously can’t get done on two counterattacks like that when we’re playing against 10 men; it’s criminal really. But we showed great spirit at that moment.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/18/party-like-its-1999-amorim-used-treble-as-inspiration-for-crazy-lyon-comeback">Party like it’s 1999: Amorim uses treble as ‘inspiration’ for crazy Lyon comeback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A number of United fans left, with some returning as the game was turned upside down. On Instagram Zirkzee said alongside a clip of the Old Trafford noise: “To all the fans who left when we were down. Have a listen to this.” You could hardly blame those who did depart. As Maguire says: “This season it’s been so difficult for everyone involved, all the fans, all the players, the staff.”</p> <p>For those who witnessed it memories were cast. This is what United do. Thursday’s box-office finish can be added to a long list that includes last term’s last-gasp <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/17/manchester-united-liverpool-fa-cup-match-report">FA Cup elimination of Liverpool</a>, the ceding of a 3-0 advantage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/21/manchester-united-coventry-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report">to Coventry in the semi-final</a> before a breathless penalty shootout win, and, of course, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2010/mar/24/manchester-united-bayern-munich-1999">the 1999 Champions League final</a> triumph.</p> <p>After beating Coventry, United claimed the FA Cup and victory over Lyon capped a spine-tingling week for English clubs on the continent after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/16/real-madrid-arsenal-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report">Arsenal knocked out Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/15/aston-villa-psg-champions-league-quarter-final-match-report">Aston Villa went close to their own Lazarus act</a> against Paris Saint-Germain.</p> <p>So a last question: will Maguire’s late, late seizing of the narrative prove Amorim’s Mark Robins moment or a freak occurrence that exposes United’s lack of what the coach needs to make them a force again?</p>
