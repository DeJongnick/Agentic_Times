It calls for a three-year freeze in the state pension and the abolition of the triple lock; the removal of pensioner benefits such as winter fuel payments, free bus passes and free prescriptions from all but the poorest; the scaling back of childcare subsidies and free school meals; and the introduction of a £20 fee for GP appointments.

He accepted that major tax cuts would be off the agenda until government debt was down, hammering both of the two main parties on their record here. Much of his 30-minute speech was indistinguishable from that given by any mainstream Conservative politician. There were echoes of the address given by Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, at last month’s Tory conference: financial education in schools, revitalising the City and cutting post-Brexit regulations.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Sean O’Grady</strong> from the Independent <a href="https://x.com/IndyVoices/status/1985359574703219038">says</a> Farage seems to be hoping economic collapse will trigger and election.</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Nigel Farage‘s suggestion that market forces will force Labour to adopt austerity measures that will in turn collapse the government is wishful thinking masquerading as wisdom.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Matthew Lynn</strong> <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/nigel-farage-is-right-to-abandon-tax-cuts/">at the Spectator</a> says the speech shows Farage is serious about power.</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In reality, Farage has learned the lesson of the Truss debacle. A Reform government could easily be destroyed by the financial markets within its first few weeks of taking power. Instead, Farage has seen that it is better to bet on growth, especially from scaling back Net Zero, and potentially opening up the UK’s plentiful reserves of shale oil and gas, and then use the revenues from that to steadily lower the tax burden.

This is from <strong>Mel Stride</strong>, the shadow chancellor.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>After a speech that was supposed to be Reform’s attempt to restore their economic credibility, Nigel Farage has left the public with far more questions than answers.</p> <p>Farage did not set out which of the £140bn of commitments he made last year he still stands by, and which he has now dropped. And in a speech which was supposed to be demonstrating fiscal restraint, he instead announced ‘the biggest council housebuilding programme ever’, which could run into the tens of billions of pounds.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stride was referring to <strong>Farage</strong> saying in his speech: “We will commit to the biggest building programme of genuinely affordable housing in this country that has ever been seen.”</p> <p><strong>Stride</strong> added:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>After this rambling, incoherent speech, it is clear Reform’s economy policy is in chaos. Farage might claim he’s not a ‘one man band’, but he can’t even tell us who his chancellor would be. This is not serious, it is just more announcements without a plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>To back up Stride’s point about unanswered questions, the Tories released a list of 10 questions unanswered by Reform UK. For the record, here they are:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>1) Which of their previous £140bn of spending commitments are Reform saying are fully funded commitments, and which are merely “aspirations”?</p> <p>2) In the speech, Farage promised the biggest council housebuilding programme ever – how much would this cost and how would it be funded?</p> <p>3) Reform’s ‘Contract’ promised what they said were £141bn a year of spending increases and unfunded tax cuts. The IFS pointed out their proposals would cost “tens of billions of pounds per year” more than they had calculated. What are Reform’s current spending and tax pledges, and how are they being paid for?</p> <p>4) Farage claimed that he had been “misunderstood” on the two-child benefit cap. So why did he previously say “we believe lifting the two-child cap is the right thing to do”? What’s changed?</p> <p>5) Farage claimed he has proposed the biggest welfare cuts of any party, including £9bn from Pip for people with low level anxiety – what evidence does he have for these claims?</p> <p>6) Farage today criticised stamp duty on shares – is he promising to remove this?</p> <p>7) Farage praised crypto again today and last month promised to cut capital gains tax on crypto assets from 24% to 10%? How much would this cost, and what would stop it from being used for tax avoidance?</p> <p>8) Farage said public sector pension savings are supposed to pay for these promises. How much are Reform proposing they will save and how? Can we see their workings?</p> <p>9) Why can’t Farage say who his shadow chancellor will be – or is he just a one-man band?</p> <p>10) Reform’s last manifesto was billed as a “contract” with the British people. Isn’t today’s speech a (partial) admission that, if he’d been elected as prime minister, he would have broken the promises he made in that contract? What does this say about our ability to trust anything Reform ever say?</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-11-04T06:51:04.299Z">at 6.51am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6908b5738f0887bdb7785d69" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-03T14:03:30.319Z">2.03pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The foreign affairs committee is currently taking evidence from Sir Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary, and Sir Olly Robbins, permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, about the appointment of Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the US.

PA Media says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The Defence Housing Service will operate as an arm’s length public body, with <em>Healey</em> saying the new service would “deliver better value for the taxpayer and fulfil our promise to provide homes fit for heroes”.</p> <p>When created, it will be one of the largest publicly owned housing providers in the country.</p> <p>Sources said the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had “not been very good” at operating service accommodation itself, and would be better able to focus on “core defence responsibilities” once housing was hived off to the new body.</p> <p>Earlier in the year, Keir Starmer pledged to reduce the number of quangos to improve accountability and cut back on bureaucracy.</p> <p>But defence sources said they had been allowed to create the new housing service as the MoD was still a “net reducer” of quangos, pointing to a “significant” consolidation of innovation bodies.</p> <p>The creation of the new body is part of a 10-year defence housing strategy, also launched today, that will see £9bn invested in service accommodation and 100,000 homes built on surplus MoD land.</p> <p><em>Healey</em> said: “Our British forces personnel and our veterans fulfil the ultimate public service. Our nation is rightly proud of them. And the very least they deserve is a decent home. This new strategy will embed a ‘forces first’ approach that tells our forces, our veterans and their families: we are on your side.”</p> <p>The “forces first” approach, announced at Labour’s party conference in September, will see military families given “first dibs” on new homes built on defence land.</p> <p>The strategy will also see almost all of the 47,700 military family homes, known as service family accommodation (SFA), either refurbished or replaced.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-69087af08f08e3e3851d280c" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-03T10:12:20.476Z">10.12am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Reform could get rid of defined benefit pensions for public sector workers, Richard Tice suggests</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The Tories claim Reform UK are “leftwing” partly on the basis of Nigel Farage’s welfare policies.

We must get the economy growing.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a huge change from <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/06/17/reform-uk-manifesto-reader-reaction/">what Farage was offering last year</a>.</p> <p>There was a time when Labour and the Conservatives largely ignored Farage speeches, but last night they both issued lengthy “pre-buttal” comments that contained more information than the Reform party preview. Labour said that Farage would revive austerity. A <strong>Labour spokesperson</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Nigel Farage says he is offering something new – but for all his talk, his plan would take us back to austerity.</p> <p>We’ve seen from the councils Reform run that they’ve failed to deliver the savings they already promised and are cutting services and raising taxes as a result. They’ve said themselves that those councils are a shop window for what a Reform government would do nationally – we know that this is more empty promises and no real plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Conservatives issued a seven-page document attacking Reform’s economic policy. In a statement, <strong>Mel Stride</strong>, the shadow chancellor, said Reform promises “disintegrate after five minutes” and that its economic policies are “leftwing”.</p> <p>Of the two lines of attack, Labour “austerity” one is more plausible, not least because of what Farage plans to say today about spending cuts coming before tax cuts. The Tories are trying to depict Reform as “leftwing” partly because some of their welfare proposals don’t involve cuts as deep as those proposed by the Tories and because the last Reform manifesto included a plan for public utilities to be run according to a model involving 50% public ownership, with the over 50% being owned by UK pension funds. But this is not an idea that Reform has been promoting recently; this aspect of the Tory briefing does not take into account Stride’s point about Reform manifesto promises only lasting five minutes.</p> <p>After the speech, other parties will get the chance to revise their attack lines against Reform.</p> <p>There is a lot of other stuff on today too. Here is the agenda.</p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> Chester crown court starts hearing<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yevz1557ro"> an election petition </a>challenging the result of the Runcorn and Helsby byelection, which was won by Reform UK’s Sarah Pochin by six votes.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, gives a speech on economic policy.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>1.30am:</em> Sir Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary, and Sir Olly Robbins, permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, give evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee about the work of the Foreign Office.
