<p>Morning everyone. After a very successful first day in Washington DC, Anthony Albanese has faced questions over so-called “ambiguity” in the Aukus deal which the US wants to change.</p> 
<p>At home, Murray Watt has given us an exclusive interview about his plans to reform the country’s environmental laws, we report on how some big companies pay more in bonuses than they do in tax, and how to keep your pets cool as the heatwave hits the east.</p> 
<h2>Australia</h2> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><em><strong>Exclusive | </strong></em>The Albanese government wants the power to strip companies of any financial gains made from breaking environment laws as part of a package of reforms to be put before parliament in the next two weeks. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/22/companies-could-have-profits-from-breaking-environment-laws-stripped-under-australian-reforms">Speaking to Guardian Australia</a>, the environment minister, Murray Watt, said he also wants a definition of “unacceptable impact” to be enshrined in law.</p></li> 
 <li><p><em><strong>Aukus ‘updates’ | </strong></em>Anthony Albanese continued his visit to Washington today and indicated the United States <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/21/albanese-says-us-could-still-seek-changes-to-aukus-agreement-amid-review">could seek updates</a> to the Aukus agreement. It comes after a day after Donald Trump’s navy secretary spoke of his hopes to “clarify some of the ambiguity” in the nuclear submarine deal. Although the rare earths deal that Albanese signed with Trump involves mines that are probably not commercially viable, the deal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/22/albaneses-critical-minerals-deal-isnt-good-economics-but-in-trump-and-xis-new-world-bargaining-chips-matter">“couldn’t have gone any better”</a> according to one leading expert.</p></li>

 <li><p><em><strong>Gold rush | </strong></em>The ABC Bullion Sydney store <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/22/gold-price-australia-thousands-queuing-sydney-bullion-store">has seen huge queues</a> as investors trade out of shares and currencies and into gold thanks to the huge increase in price. That being said, the precious metal saw its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/oct/21/uk-borrowing-outstrips-forecasts-reeves-amazon-web-services-outage-resolved-bank-of-england-stock-markets-business-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-68f78e818f082fc3b1775d82#block-68f78e818f082fc3b1775d82">biggest one-day fall since 2020</a> overnight.</p></li>
