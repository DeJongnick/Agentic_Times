<p>The days are getting shorter, the last flush of&nbsp;blackberries are hanging sweetly on their prickly branches and a final flurry of tomatoes are ripening. With the end of the summer crops nigh, my thoughts have turned to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/28/how-to-pickle-bottle-and-preserve-almost-everything">how to capture their magic</a> for times ahead when I’m craving sun.</p> <p>My favourite way to preserve fruit is&nbsp;to make jam. It started with a new year’s resolution in 2011 to learn how, and I’ve been zealously pouring sugar over&nbsp;berries ever since. Two recipes I like to follow are from <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/430003/the-modern-preserver-by-newton-kylee/9780224101165">Kylee Newton’s book, The Modern Preserver</a>: damson jam with orange, and blackberry jam with&nbsp;the juniper tones of gin. Jam-making involves cooking the fruit in water before adding sugar (which stops the fruit from softening further), then boiling away the excess liquid until the concoction reaches the desired consistency.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>Make a quick pickle by placing thinly sliced cucumber in a jar with coarse salt, vinegar, dill and a red chilli</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pectin is needed for jams to set, so&nbsp;those made from high-pectin fruit,&nbsp;such as blackcurrants and gooseberries, set easily. Others, such&nbsp;as strawberries, need extra pectin (in the form of a powder or jam&nbsp;sugar) to form a preserve that will&nbsp;solidify and keep.</p> <p>Another set of summer flavours I’m&nbsp;eager to capture this year is that of&nbsp;the soft, leafy herbs I’ve been stirring through sauces, bashing into pesto and piling on top of salads. Thankfully, basil, coriander, dill, chervil and fennel can all be stored in&nbsp;the freezer. Finely chopped, these herbs can be placed in water or olive oil, portioned into an ice cube tray, then kept in freezer bags for a few months, ready to be defrosted or plopped<strong> </strong>directly into winter soups and&nbsp;stews. There are also plenty of vegetables that can be prepped and stored in the freezer, including runner&nbsp;beans, chopped kale and cubed&nbsp;squash.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/28/how-to-pickle-bottle-and-preserve-almost-everything">The power of pickles: a guide to preserving almost everything – from jam-making to chutneys</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If, like me, you like tangy pickled vegetables, many crops – courgettes, cucumbers and beetroot to start – are ideal for preserving in salt water or vinegar. I like to make a quick pickle by placing thinly sliced cucumber in a&nbsp;sterilised jar with a few teaspoons of&nbsp;coarse salt, some white vinegar, dill&nbsp;fronds and a red chilli. Popped in&nbsp;the fridge and shaken regularly, the&nbsp;contents transform into crisp snacks submerged in brine. They won’t&nbsp;last as long as whole pickled cucumbers but are easy to make and&nbsp;utterly delicious.</p> <p>Finally this season, I’m going to attempt to ferment the green tomatoes that fail to ripen, following chef Olia Hercules’ easy instructions: pop the tomatoes in a jar and cover them with a brine made of 8-10% salt (plus some garlic or peppercorns, if you like) and leave until the liquid turns opaque. The result – as Hercules describes it – is sweet, sour and absolutely delicious.</p>
