<p>Anthony Albanese and Jim Chalmers have presided over the first day of the economic reform roundtable, with discussions focused on training, skills and worker mobility.</p> <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia governor, Michele Bullock, and a slew of bureaucrats, business leaders and trade unions took part in the opening sessions of the three-day event.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/19/empty-corridors-and-a-quiet-hum-if-there-were-fireworks-at-albaneses-economic-roundtable-they-were-well-hidden">Empty corridors and a quiet hum: if there were fireworks at Albanese’s economic roundtable, they were well hidden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The treasurer praised the quality and calibre of engagement as “outstanding”.</p> <p>“It’s been a really promising and productive first day,” Chalmers said.</p> <p>Here are five takeaways from day one of the event at Parliament House:</p>  <h2>Unions want business to pay for worker training</h2>  <p>Union leaders including the ACTU boss, Sally McManus, called for a new levy on business to pay for training for those workers who want to up skill for their jobs. The proposal would impose a 1.5% levy on businesses with a turnover of $500,000 or above.</p> <p>Employers hate the idea.</p> <p>The Business Council of Australia boss, Bran Black, said such new levies would be a backward step. He said the government should pay for incentives for trainee workers.</p> <p>“From a business perspective, we just don’t see that taxing the business community is the right way to deliver the outcomes that Australia needs,” Black said.</p> <p>The Australian Industry Group boss, Innes Willox, said the plan would hit more than 70,000 Australian businesses and raise about $4.5bn.</p> <p>“We’ve done a training levy before in Australia, between 1990 and 1996. It didn’t work, it distorted the market,” he said.</p> <p>“The Productivity Commission said it was distortionary and it also adds to compliance costs.”</p> <h2>Albanese open to big ideas</h2>  <p>The prime minister told attendees their work would feed in to next year’s federal budget, as well as the mid-year economic update expected just before Christmas.</p> <p>Despite dampening expectations of major reforms in areas such as tax, Albanese said longer term reform proposals and priorities were possible.</p> <p>He nominated AI as one area requiring a longer period of work.</p> <p>“I don’t expect that you will solve all of those issues in the next three days, but what you will have is ideas and input that will shape that agenda and … public discourse.</p> <h2>'Quick wins' needed on skills</h2>  <p>There could be an agreement to better recognise the skills and qualifications of those who have trained overseas.</p> <p>Willox said “millions of people” were in Australia doing jobs that were way below their skill level”.</p> <p>“There’s recognition that the system is jammed up. [There are] people who have qualifications that are not recognised, be that migrants or be that people trying to transfer between states or even … between occupations.</p> <p>“It’s really important we do get some quick wins.”</p> <p>Liam O’Brien, an assistant secretary at the ACTU, agreed that recognition of prior learning and the transfer of credit for previous qualifications was a “priority”.</p> <p>But hopes for a quick win look likely to be disappointed, after O’Brien said “the devil is in the detail”.</p> <p>“I think it is a very tricky one for us to resolve.”</p> <h2>Workers should win from productivity gains too</h2>  <p>Jennifer Westacott, a former BCA boss and the chancellor of Western Sydney University, called for the benefits of productivity gains to be shared with workers.</p> <p>Speaking after taking part in a session on skills, development and mobility, she said business leaders wanted to reward workers who were doing a good job.</p> <p>“It’s about creating more value from what we do,” she told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>“There has to be a sense in which people feel that they’re getting the benefits. </p> <p>“The best way of sharing things is high wages and we can’t get started if we are not growing at a rate that allows us to expand the economy.”</p> <p>Westacott said households had weathered the cost-of-living crisis sparked by post-pandemic inflation but the next challenge was standards of living.</p> <p>“If you look at the last decade, we’ve seen the lowest rate of GDP per capita in the last six decades. That’s a red line.”</p> <h2>AI dominating discussions</h2>  <p>AI was a major topic of conversation.</p> <p>“Something that was really positive, where there was a lot of agreement, was the sense that we do need to help the Australian community skill-up in terms of its confidence in using AI,” the independent MP Allegra Spender said.</p> <p>Barney Glover, the commissioner of Jobs and Skills Australia, recently described AI as a “foundational skill” that needed to be taught in schools.</p> <p>The JSA in a major report found that clerical roles were among a number of white collar occupations threatened by AI, but that the technology was more likely to augment jobs, rather than replace them.</p> <p>The transformative technology is sure to also loom large on day two of the roundtable, which will focus on productivity.</p>
