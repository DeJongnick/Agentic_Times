<h2>England</h2> <p><strong>Hannah Hampton</strong> Distribution was excellent, particularly her superb pass that led to England’s opening goal. 7</p> <p><strong>Lucy Bronze </strong>Much improved from Saturday and showed all her experience with her positioning. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Leah Williamson </strong>Orchestrated the team solidly from the back and blocked crosses well when called upon.<strong> 7</strong></p> <p><strong>Jess Carter </strong>Looked significantly more comfortable at centre-back. Tackled strongly and read the game very well.<strong> 8</strong></p> <p><strong>Alex Greenwood </strong>Supremely calm on the ball and composed one-on-one. England have found their best back four lineup.<strong> 7</strong></p> <p><strong>Ella Toone </strong>Always offered teammates an option, worked hard and took her goal nicely. Good display.<strong> 7</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/09/england-netherlands-womens-euro-2025-group-d-match-report">Lauren James double ignites England’s Euro campaign in thrashing of Netherlands</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Keira Walsh </strong>Took control of midfield and looked like the player we saw at Euro 2022.<strong> 7</strong></p> <p><strong>Georgia Stanway </strong>Her emphatic strike was richly deserved. She was terrier-like, never giving the Dutch a moment’s rest.<strong> 8</strong></p> <p><strong>Lauren James </strong>She terrified the Netherlands. Took her first goal magnificently. The star of the show.<strong> 8</strong></p> <p><strong>Alessia Russo </strong>Her work rate and movement deserved a goal. Unfortunate to have one ruled out again.<strong> 7</strong></p> <p><strong>Lauren Hemp </strong>Had the beating of Casparij all night. Confident, skilful and could have had three assists.<strong> 7</strong></p> <p><strong>Substitutes<br>Chloe Kelly (James, 69)</strong> England were in cruise control by the time she was brought on, but she did her job well. <strong>6; Beth Mead </strong>(Hemp, 76)<strong> 6; Grace Clinton </strong>(Toone, 76)<strong> 6; Aggie Beever-Jones </strong>(Russo, 84)<strong> 6; Niamh Charles </strong>(Bronze, 84)<strong> 6.</strong></p>    <h2>Netherlands</h2> <p><strong>Daphne van Domselaar </strong>Not good, but she did make a couple of decent saves to prevent England from running riot.<strong> 5</strong></p> <p><strong>Kerstin Casparij </strong>Struggled against her Manchester City teammate Hemp throughout and had a fairly bad evening.<strong> 5</strong></p> <p><strong>Dominique Janssen </strong>Russo gave her the runaround. She may have nightmares about the England striker.<strong> 4</strong></p> <p><strong>Veerle Buurman </strong>Looked outclassed by the skill in England’s forward line. One of three players taken off at half-time.<strong> 4</strong></p> <p><strong>Esmee Brugts </strong>Could not cope with the flair of James. Hard to remember her winning a duel.<strong> 5</strong></p> <p><strong>Wieke Kaptein </strong>Outbattled by Stanway, outrun by Toone and out-thought by Walsh.<strong> 5</strong></p> <p><strong>Jackie Groenen </strong>Another Netherlands midfielder who simply could not get into the game. Failed to create enough.<strong> 5</strong></p> <p><strong>Victoria Pelova </strong>Looked in excellent form against Wales but could not reproduce it. Never worried England.<strong> 5</strong></p> <p><strong>Chasity Grant </strong>Dangerous with her pace early on and did at least try to get in behind.<strong> 6</strong></p> <p><strong>Vivianne Miedema </strong>Outplayed by Carter and failed to make an impact before being substituted.<strong> 5</strong></p> <p><strong>Jill Roord </strong>Curled over from a half chance but was otherwise relatively quiet as England dominated.<strong> 5</strong></p> <p><strong>Substitutes<br>Caitlin Dijkstra </strong>(Brugts, ht)<strong> </strong>Made a slight difference but was still no match for this confident England.<strong> 6; Lineth Beerensteyn </strong>(Roord, h-t) Momentarily looked as if she could be the gamechanger but England coped well.<strong> 6; Sherida Spitse </strong>(Buurman, h-t)<strong> </strong>One of the Netherlands’ all-time greats, but she is not the player she used to be.<strong> 5; Daniëlle van de Donk</strong> (Miedema, 66) <strong>6;</strong> <strong>Damaris Egurrola</strong> (Groenen, 85) <strong>6</strong></p>
