Who would face these consequences and what they could possibly entail is not exactly clear.</p> <p>Despite much speculation about the timing and the potential location for the Putin-Zelenskyy meeting, we do not appear to be any closer to it <em>actually</em> happening as Russian attacks on Ukraine continue.</p>    <p>Asked why Putin didn’t want to meet with Zelenskyy, he offered this explanation: <strong>“Because he doesn’t like him.”</strong></p> <p>Trump revealed that <strong>he had talked to Putin since his last week’s meeting with European leaders</strong> again.</p> <p>Asked how the conversation talks went, Trump said:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Every conversation I have with him is a good conversation. And then, unfortunately, a bomb is loaded up into Kyiv or someplace, and I get very angry about it.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>On a more technical level, US state secretary <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> spoke with his European counterparts last night, <strong>discussing potential security guarantees for the wartorn country</strong> should the meeting go ahead and the two leaders somehow managed to find a way to agree a peace deal. Once again, we are yet to see what emerges from these talks.</p> <p>Ukraine’s foreign minister <strong>Andrii Sybiha</strong> praised the US leadership on this issue, but “reiterated … that security guarantees must be concrete, legally binding, and effective.”</p> <p>But Poland’s foreign minister <strong>Radosław Sikorski</strong> warned the leaders that “the Kremlin has not abandoned its maximalist aims from the beginning of the war,” and insisted that the only way to get Moscow round to the negotiating table is through further political, economic and military pressure on its interests.</p> <p>Let’s see what today brings us on these two issues.</p> <p>Separately, I will also keep an eye on <strong>the latest in France as the country’s embattled prime minister looks likely to be ousted and his government toppled next month</strong> in a high-stakes confidence vote that could plunge the EU’s second-biggest economy into even deeper political crisis.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/francois-bayrou-france-prime-minister-confidence-vote">French prime minister to face potential ousting in high-stakes confidence vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We should also <strong>get some new language on the EU-US trade arrangements</strong>, with Trump threatening overnight to impose tariffs and exports bans on countries with taxes and laws deemed to be discriminating against US tech companies. His longstanding criticism of the EU’s rulebook is well known, so this latest warning will probably draw another deep sigh from EU officials.</p> <p>I will bring you all the key updates here.</p> <p>It’s <strong>Tuesday, 26 August 2025,</strong> it’s <strong>Jakub Krupa</strong> here, and this is <strong>Europe Live.</strong></p> <p><strong>Good morning.</strong></p> </div>   </div>
