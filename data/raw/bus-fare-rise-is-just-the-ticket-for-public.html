<p>As a non-driver and bus user all my life, I can understand why the government has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/28/englands-bus-fare-cap-will-rise-from-2-to-3-in-2025-says-starmer">raised the bus fare cap</a> to £3. Anyone who has used buses for a long time knows that this is still cheaper than it’s been for years in most areas. I suspect most people asked about the rise (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-politics-of-buses-labours-winning-ticket">Editorial, 20 November</a>) were not bus users or had bus passes.<br><strong>Trevor Hopper </strong><br><em>Lewes</em><em>, East Sussex</em> </p> <p>• Anyone who thinks raising the bus fare cap to £3 is OK either never travels by bus or holds in contempt the demographic that&nbsp;needs to use them. <br><strong>Lois Ozlojo</strong><br><em>Southend-on-Sea</em> </p> <p>• Re the Covid letters (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/15/covid-is-no-laughing-matter-when-it-continues-to-hurt-so-many">Covid is no laughing matter when it continues to hurt so many, 15 November</a>), it’s OK to joke about dark stuff. Laughter is a defence mechanism. My fellow medical students and I relied on dark humour to get us through the awful things we saw as youngsters in the 1970s. Humour is a coping strategy and we all emerged as competent, caring doctors.<br><strong>Dr Roger Timms</strong><br><em>Norwich</em></p> <p>• Re calling tourists in Cornwall emmets or grockles (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/19/midlife-mots-on-the-nhs-who-knew">Letters, 19 November</a>) – both are offensive. They are holidaymakers hoping to enjoy our beautiful county. I’d like to think that when I leave Cornwall to visit other places I will welcomed, not called a name.<br><strong>Maggie Matthews</strong><br><em>Helston, Cornwall</em></p> <p>• I inquired about a basic health check when I reached my mid-70s and was told that unless I was on medication, it was not available (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/19/midlife-mots-on-the-nhs-who-knew">Letters, 19 November</a>). Rather&nbsp;counterproductive. <br><strong>Lynda McDonald</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
