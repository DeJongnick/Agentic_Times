The alternative response of lifting prices to cover lost surcharge revenue could make small businesses less competitive.</p>    <p>Big businesses are less likely to surcharge and typically pay less for payment systems, but small firms pay more and rely on the charges to offer customers competitive prices, IPF co-founder <strong>Bradford Kelly</strong> said. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The proposed regulatory options fail small businesses and the local communities they serve. Rather, they benefit big business, big banks and big offshore companies.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kelly said the RBA should consider alternatives including capping the card scheme fees businesses pay. The Reserve Bank’s Tuesday report instead recommended the surcharge removal be paired with a separate cap on charges and increased fee transparency, which it estimated would save small businesses $185m per year.</p> <p>Hospitality businesses have criticised the proposal and small business payment network Tyro has seen its share price slip 7% today, but its competitor Square welcomed the reform.
