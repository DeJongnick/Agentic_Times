<p>Private renters in England are spending an increasing proportion of their income on housing, according to the latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2023-to-2024-experiences-of-the-housing-crisis/english-housing-survey-2023-to-2024-experiences-of-the-housing-crisis">official data</a> from the English Housing Survey.</p> <p>In 2023-24, the proportion of gross household income spent on housing costs for private renters rose to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2023-to-2024-experiences-of-the-housing-crisis/english-housing-survey-2023-to-2024-experiences-of-the-housing-crisis">34% on average</a>, climbing from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2022-to-2023-affordability-and-cost-of-living-fact-sheet/english-housing-survey-2022-to-2023-affordability-and-cost-of-living-fact-sheet#proportion-of-income-spent-on-housing">32% for 2022-23</a>.</p> <p>The proportion of income spent on housing was significantly higher for those on low-incomes.

What impact does this have on your quality of life or on managing your living costs?
