<p>Good afternoon.</p> <p>Organisers of a pro-Palestine rally have offered to delay their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/28/sydney-harbour-bridge-pro-palestine-march-gaza-nsw-minns-government-ntwnfb">march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge</a> after the New South Wales government said it would not support the protest. On Monday, the Sydney-based Palestine Action Group announced it wanted its rally to walk across the bridge to the US consulate this Sunday.</p> <p>But the premier, Chris Minns, said his government could not support a protest of that size across the bridge this weekend, saying “we cannot allow Sydney to descend into chaos”. </p> <p>Scores of Palestinians have died of starvation in recent weeks.
