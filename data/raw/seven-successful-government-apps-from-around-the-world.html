<p>For many people, apps are the preferred way of doing everything online, from shopping to watching TV – so it’s hardly surprising that local and national governments have got in on the act.</p> <p>Given the maintenance costs, the UK’s <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> recommends that government services should be delivered via responsive design websites instead. However, many local authorities across the UK have partnered with third-party companies to offer apps designed to make citizens’ lives easier and cut the cost of delivering services.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the world, governments are embracing apps with enthusiasm. They work faster than mobile websites and are more interactive, as well as being easier to personalise. And, perhaps most importantly, they are instantly accessible from anywhere at the touch of a button – making citizens far more likely to use them. </p> <p>We have looked at seven innovative and successful government apps from around the world.</p> <h2>State of Arkansas </h2>    <p>Arkansas is the first US state to allow citizens to access local services via a digital personal assistant, <a href="https://www.getgov2go.com/">Gov2Go</a> – and says it’s a great success. Accessible via native mobile apps, the Apple Watch and TV apps and the web, Gov2Go alerts users to important government deadlines such as voter registration, property tax payments and car tag renewals.</p> <p>More than 260,000 people have signed up, with 6,700 paying their taxes through the online link this year. In the run up to the US election, users were also given personalised reminders about when and where to cast their vote.</p> <h2>Hong Kong</h2>    <p>The Hong Kong government’s free <a href="http:// http://www.landsd.gov.hk/mapping/en/VoiceMapHK/index.htm">VoiceMap HK</a> is designed to allow the visually impaired to make use of apps such as Google Maps – although sighted users are taking advantage of it too. Currently available for the iPhone only, it gives oral directions, and is available in English and Chinese versions.</p> <p>Users can identify their position and search for nearby transport links and points of interest. The app then provides detailed directions, with information on orientation and distance – for example, “Sheung Wan Station A2 Access, at 10 o’clock direction, straight line distance about 300 metres away”.</p> <h2>Mid and East Antrim borough council</h2>    <p>Launched in partnership with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, the <a href="https://www.midandeastantrim.gov.uk/resident/environmental-health/noise">Noise App</a> makes it easier for people to complain about nuisance neighbours.</p> <p>Using the app, residents can log location, dates and times and make 30-second recordings of the nuisance, and explain how the noise is affecting them. The data is then automatically sent to the investigating environmental health officer. While council officers still need to follow up in person to see whether a statutory noise nuisance exists, the recordings can be used as supporting evidence.</p> <h2>Christchurch city council</h2>    <p>Residents of Christchurch in New Zealand can now report everything from potholes to broken playground equipment or suspected pests through an app called <a href="https://cccgovtnz.cwp.govt.nz/the-council/newsline/show/652">Snap, Send Solve</a>. In its first year, nearly 10,000 incidents have been reported this way.</p> <p>“The app works by identifying the location the photo is taken using the phone’s GPS data. It then sends an email to the council, including the picture, which is then allocated to the relevant department,” explains council information technology service manager Dana Burnett. The council says the app is generating significant cost savings already.</p> <h2>Milton Keynes council</h2>    <p>With the land value of a parking space reckoned at more than £10,000 and annual maintenance over £200, Milton Keynes council hopes to cut costs by millions and help motorists by installing sensors in car parks. </p> <p>The sensors monitor occupancy, with the data transmitted wirelessly to receivers on lamp posts and then to a central data hub. Drivers can locate and reserve empty spaces in real time via an Android or iPhone app. The data is also used to improve services – for example, by revealing that the maximum wait limit in the station drop-off zone was too short for most drivers.</p> <h2>Government of British Columbia</h2>    <p>The Government of British Columbia’s free <a href="http://highwaysapp.com/">DriveBC app</a> is designed to help drivers plan their route. Data from the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, including real-time information on road closures, planned work and extreme weather conditions, is integrated with driver reports from Twitter to give an accurate picture of the state of the province’s roads.</p> <p>Users can apply filters to see how events will affect a particular journey, or check the state of traffic province-wide. The app also provides access to highway webcams, and gives estimated wait times at the US border.</p> <h2>Hungarian government</h2>    <p>After the 2008 financial crash, in a bid to save costs, the Hungarian government shifted all its hospital records to a central government-controlled server. It is now piloting a project to allow patients to access this information through a free app, providing disease information and access to personal health records. So far, 20,000 people have signed up.</p> <p>Patients can upload information about their weight, blood pressure, glucose levels, diet and exercise for personalised advice. The next stage, under development now, is to add telemedicine services, allowing them to have consultations with their doctor through a messaging interface.</p> <p> <strong><a href="https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/">Sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.
