<p>Craig McLachlan has withdrawn from the Australian production of Cluedo after a backlash to his casting seven years after he was accused of, and denied, touching, kissing and groping his female co-stars without their permission.</p> <p>Last Wednesday the show’s producers Crossroads Live announced that McLachlan had been cast as Colonel Mustard in a stage adaptation of the 1985 film Clue, based on the boardgame.</p> <p>“In the hours and days that followed, I was targeted in a social media campaign from within the theatre community, which I was devastated to see has then impacted those involved in the production,” McLachlan said in a statement issued via Crossroads on Tuesday morning. “I therefore feel that it is best for the production and those involved for me to withdraw.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/mar/07/michael-jackson-mj-the-musical-ntwnfb">How MJ the Musical sanitised Michael Jackson’s story: ‘Can we really sit in a theatre and pretend?’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOpSAyWEhOL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MXF2N2h5ZHg3MTF5OA==">video posted on Instagram</a> the actor said his mother had died on Monday, delaying his statement. He said the social media backlash had extended to his family and friends as well as two other actors in the Cluedo cast.</p> <p>“I cannot and will not let my involvement in a show result in good people being targeted,” McLachlan said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Cluedo, which is set to open in Brisbane in January before a national tour, was to have been McLachlan’s first theatrical role since a 2018 production of The Rocky Horror Show, which was co-produced by John Frost, now the chief executive of Crossroads Live.</p> <p>McLachlan withdrew from the production that year after allegations of historical sexual misconduct were made by three of his female co-stars in a 2014 production of the same show.</p> <p>He was also later accused of touching, kissing and groping actors without permission in Neighbours, City Homicide and the Doctor Blake Mysteries.</p> <p>McLachlan was ultimately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/15/craig-mclachlan-found-not-guilty-of-indecently-assaulting-rocky-horror-co-stars">cleared of six assault and seven indecent assault allegations</a> in 2020. ​The Melbourne magistrate described McLachlan’s accusers as brave and honest but said it was not enough to prove the incidents amounted to assault.</p> <p>The magistrate also noted that changes to the standard of proof required for consent, which couldn’t be applied retrospectively as they came in after the time of the allegations, could have changed the outcome of the charges.</p> <p>McLachlan later instigated then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/20/craig-mclachlan-drops-defamation-case-against-abc-fairfax-and-christie-whelan-browne">dropped a defamation case</a> against Fairfax Media, the ABC and his accuser Christie Whelan Browne in 2022, citing his mental health.</p> <p>On social media, the initial announcement of McLachlan’s casting in Cluedo was met with dismay and anger from dozens of commenters.</p> <p>On Instagram the performer Queenie van de Zandt wrote that she was “shocked and disheartened by the casting of Craig McLachlan”, and that it sent the message that women’s voices have been dismissed.</p> <p>In a statement issued by Crossroads Live, Frost issued an apology.</p> <p>“Craig McLachlan’s theatrical stage return wasn’t well received by some of the industry and public,” Frost wrote. “The resulting impact on others involved has prompted his withdrawal from the production.</p> <p>“I have listened to the feedback and, as producer, whilst it was my initial casting decision, I understand the opposing sentiment and I am sorry for any distress this decision has caused.”</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
