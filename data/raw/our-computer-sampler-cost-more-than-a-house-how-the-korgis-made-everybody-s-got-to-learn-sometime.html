<h2><strong>James Warren</strong><strong>, vocalist/bassist/songwriter</strong></h2> <p>We’d had a Top 20 single in the UK with If I Had You and were recording our second Korgis album, Dumb Waiters. I was living in Bath and had a piano in the flat that I couldn’t really play – I am a guitarist and bass player. But regardless, I battled away at the ivories every day trying to come up with interesting chord sequences.</p> <p>Basically, I was trying to write a rock ballad that I thought might get us on the radio in the US as I was convinced that the Korgis could have a future there. One Sunday morning, I went to the piano and the first thing I came up with was the opening chords to what became the “change your heart” verse section. This inspired the chorus phrase: “Everybody’s got to learn sometime.” But initially I wasn’t sure what feel the chorus should have. It was our drummer and guitarist Andy Davis who suggested keeping the chorus in a minor key like the verse. Then the song, though simple, felt satisfyingly complete.</p>    <p>The musical vision I had in my mind was Paul McCartney’s demo for The Long and Winding Road where it was just solo voice, piano, bass and drums – which was how we did our original studio demo. I think if we’d stayed with that, we would have ended up with simply a pleasant album track – but we owe it to our producer, David Lord, for seeing the song’s potential. He gave it a more luxurious production with big washes of smooth synthesiser strings and the occasional musical hook played by a sampled Japanese koto.</p> <p>The finished result sounded gorgeous and we really started to feel we’d come up with something special when friends dropped by the studio to have a listen and were bowled over by this strange and utterly unique creation. We knew then that if ever there was a radio-friendly pop record, this was it!</p> <p>Even so, we were amazed a couple of months later to see the finished track reach No 18 on the Billboard chart in the US, No 5 in the UK and No 1 in France, Spain and the Netherlands. I think people see it as being a romantic, one-to-one love song, which is a perfectly acceptable interpretation. But for me, it was an attempt at a Zen philosophical statement, inspired by the Buddhist meditation practice I was into at the time.</p> <p>Since the 1980s, the song has had a life of its own, with more than 50 cover versions to date. My favourite is the dark and brooding version<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5yDpSxfXc"> </a>Beck did for the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I have to remind myself that this was something I wrote in 20 minutes on the piano one Sunday morning 45 years ago.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_wvl6JB6E"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ns_wvl6JB6E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>David Lord, producer</strong></h2> <p>We had finished our Dumb Waiters album but felt it was running a bit short and needed another track. James sat down at the piano and said: “Well, I’ve got this song.” He did a verse that was in a plaintive minor key but when he went to the chorus, it changed to a major which gave it a more uplifting mood, rather Beatles-ish sounding. Andy suggested a couple of chord changes to keep it in the same minor mood of the verse.</p> <p>James had also written a second verse, but nobody, including the record company, liked it. I guess the record company thought if it was going to be a hit, it needed a second verse. They were really pressing us to get one. When we wrote a new one, they didn’t like that either, so we went back to the original. Most people don’t realise it’s the same lyric repeated in the two verses. And then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/stuart-gordon-obituary">Stuart Gordon</a> added the brilliant violin solo in the middle which was done in one take.</p> <p>We were lucky because Peter Gabriel, who I’d been working with, lent us new instruments, his cousin having become English distributor for the revolutionary – and expensive – Fairlight computer sampler keyboard. I believe that, at the time, it cost more than the average UK house!</p> <p>The Japanese-sounding hook between the verses was played on a sampled guzheng [a Chinese plucked zither] on the also very new Synclavier keyboard. If you played a key quickly it did this short-plucked string sound, but if you played a longer note the sample had a bend. So that became the distinctive oriental hook between the verses. Just four short notes and a long one with the bend. There have been some really some great covers of the song. I especially love the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQjDvTjtty8"> Zucchero</a> one.</p> <p>• The new Korgis album UN-United Nations is out now, along with a new single, Red Flag Day</p>
