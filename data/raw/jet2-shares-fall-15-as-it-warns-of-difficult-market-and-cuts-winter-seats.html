<p>Travel operator Jet2 shares fell sharply on Thursday after it cut back its seats on sale for the winter, warning of a difficult market with customers booking holidays ever nearer the departure date.</p> <p>Shares in the holiday group fell by 15% after it told investors its earnings for the year were now likely to be at the lower end of forecasts.</p> <p>Jet2 said it would have to cut 200,000 seats, from 5.8m to 5.6m, over the winter season because of “a less certain consumer environment” – despite the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/19/a-pr-dream-or-disaster-jet2s-holiday-advert-finds-new-life-as-joke-meme">viral spread of its marketing jingle</a> this summer.</p> <p>The ad campaign – a Jess Glynne song ending with the message, “Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday” – has been widely repurposed on TikTok and social media to ironically soundtrack disastrous vacation scenes. Jet2 said it would now be “reallocating marketing monies”.</p> <p>The firm said customers were booking later than ever, a trend that made for “limited visibility” and meant that pricing was only rising modestly, with much of winter seat capacity still to sell.</p> <p>Package holiday passenger numbers grew by 2% in summer 2025, slower than the 8% growth reported the previous year. Its flight-only passenger numbers were up by 17%.</p> <p>Steve Heapy, Jet2’s chief executive, said: “Although we are currently operating in a difficult market, we have a proven business model, a loyal customer base, a flexible approach to capacity management and of course our multi-award-winning customer service.</p> <p>“We believe that these factors provide the foundation for a solid financial result this year and for further profitable growth in the years to come.”</p> <p>A hot early summer and economic uncertainty may have contributed to the late booking trend, which Jet2 highlighted in July, when shares fell despite the firm unveiling record profits.</p> <p>Shares in easyJet, which also now has a growing holiday arm, fell almost 4% as trading opened on Thursday, while IAG shares also took an early dip before recovering to 1% down by late morning.</p>
