<p>The world’s wind and solar farms have generated more electricity than coal plants for the first time this year, marking a turning point for the global power system, according to research.</p> <p>A report by the climate thinktank Ember found that in the first six months of 2025, renewable energy outpaced the world’s growing appetite for electricity, leading to a small decline in coal and gas use.</p> <p>The world generated almost a third more solar power in the first half of the year compared with the same period in 2024, meeting 83% of the global increase in electricity demand. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower">Wind power</a> grew by just over 7%, allowing renewables to displace fossil fuels for the first time.</p> <p>The milestone represents “a crucial turning point”, according to Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, a senior electricity analyst at Ember and the author of the report.</p> <p>She said: “Solar and wind are now growing fast enough to meet the world’s growing appetite for electricity. This marks the beginning of a shift where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth.”</p> <p>China and India were largely responsible for the surge in renewables, according to the Ember report, in contrast with the US and Europe, which relied more heavily on fossil fuels.</p> <p>A separate report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that global <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy">renewables</a> could more than double by the end of the decade, with 80% of new clean energy capacity expected to come from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/solarpower">solar power</a>.</p> <p>Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said: “The growth in global renewable capacity in the coming years will be dominated by solar PV – but with wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal all contributing, too.”</p> <p>The IEA said China would remain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/07/china-fossil-fuel-us-climate-environment-energy">the world’s biggest growth market for renewables</a>, with India emerging as the second largest over the rest of the decade.</p> <p>“In addition to growth in established markets, solar is set to surge in economies such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and several south-east Asian countries,” Birol added.</p> <p>China added more renewable energy generation than the rest of the world combined, leading to a 2% drop in its use of fossil fuels in the first half of the year compared with the same months in 2024, Ember found.</p> <p>Over the same period India grew its renewable energy by more than three times its electricity demand – which was significantly weaker this year – causing its coal and gas use to fall by 3.1% and 34% respectively.</p> <p>By contrast, demand for electricity in the US outpaced its growing renewables sector, leading to a 17% increase in coal generation in the first half of the year.</p> <p>In the EU, demand showed only modest growth compared with the first half of last year, but a weather-related slump in wind and hydro power meant even fast-rising solar power could not prevent gas and coal generation increasing by 14% and 1.1% respectively.</p>
