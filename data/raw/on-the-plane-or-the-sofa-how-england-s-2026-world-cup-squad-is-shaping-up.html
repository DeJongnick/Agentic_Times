<h2 data-note-id="c9744ff6-a37e-4635-ad9f-30f47d8f7306" data-type="subhead"><strong>On the plane</strong></h2> <p>Fresh from breaking Gordon Banks’s record for consecutive England clean sheets, <strong>Jordan&nbsp;Pickford</strong> remains the undisputed pick in goal. A miserly defensive record is a positive for Thomas Tuchel, even if the shutouts have come against poor sides. <strong>John Stones</strong>, such an elegant centre-back, is back in the team and will start at the World Cup if he stays fit. But who will partner him? Tuchel likes <strong>Ezri Konsa</strong>, whose versatility also makes him an option at right-back, and <strong>Marc&nbsp;Guéhi</strong>; big <strong>Dan Burn</strong> also looks established after making his international debut in March. It is more uncertain at left-back, but <strong>Reece&nbsp;James</strong> will play at right-back as long as his body does not let him down.</p>    <p><strong>Declan&nbsp;Rice</strong> is a guaranteed starter in midfield and<strong> Elliot&nbsp;Anderson</strong> has been a revelation since his debut last month. <strong>Jordan&nbsp;Henderson</strong>’s<strong> </strong>selection no longer feels controversial, especially as he is back in the Premier League and playing well for Brentford.</p> <p>Some picks are obvious. <strong>Bukayo&nbsp;Saka</strong> remains the man on the right wing and <strong>Noni Madueke</strong> excelled in the win against Serbia last month. <strong>Morgan Rogers</strong>, an emerging Tuchel favourite, continues to counter-press and link well at No&nbsp;10. <strong>Eberechi&nbsp;Eze</strong>, who can play in a range of positions across the frontline, is also well placed and there was praise for <strong>Anthony&nbsp;Gordon</strong>’s lively performance on the left against Latvia on Tuesday night. As for <strong>Harry&nbsp;Kane</strong>, what more needs to be said?</p> <h2 data-note-id="c2421b6e-de8a-432f-8bc6-2e7d7a63756d" data-type="subhead"><strong>In the departure lounge</strong></h2> <p>The big question is whether <strong>Jude&nbsp;Bellingham</strong> will force his way back into Tuchel’s plans. Will he respect the hierarchy and follow tactical instructions? Much will become clearer when the head coach names his squad for the games against Albania and Serbia next month. Another snub for Bellingham would speak volumes. But can England afford to&nbsp;go to the World Cup without one of their most talented players?</p> <p>The likeliest outcome is surely a humbler version of Bellingham returning to the fold. Tuchel, though, has been strong on building a collective; he does not care about celebrity. The team come first and that may mean some big names missing out. <strong>Cole Palmer</strong> is at risk. He has played only once for Tuchel and is struggling with a groin injury. But in a squad of 26 would it be wise to overlook a player with such a good record in big games?</p>    <p><strong>Dean&nbsp;Henderson</strong> will push Pickford, while the only worry for the Manchester City goalkeeper <strong>James&nbsp;Trafford</strong> is a lack of football after the arrival of Gigi&nbsp;Donnarumma at the club. <strong>Ollie Watkins </strong>is first in line behind Kane.<strong> Marcus&nbsp;Rashford </strong>has dropped to the bench and has been challenged by Tuchel to show more consistency but will be impossible to leave out if he impresses for Barcelona. Kane needs runners around him. An in-form Rashford is a potent weapon on the left and provides cover in the middle.</p> <p>As for the full-backs, the speedy duo of <strong>Tino Livramento</strong> and <strong>Djed&nbsp;Spence</strong> can play on both flanks and have done well in recent outings. <strong>Myles Lewis-Skelly</strong> is more vulnerable – Tuchel has said he needs to start more for Arsenal – but it is worth remembering that he is left-footed. One of Gareth&nbsp;Southgate’s biggest errors at Euro 2024 was not picking a specialist left-back.</p> <h2 data-note-id="b11eba79-a963-4c86-afc5-0c01b1429d9a" data-type="subhead"><strong>Hoping for a ticket</strong></h2> <p>There will be a clamour for Tuchel to pick <strong>Adam Wharton</strong>. The Crystal&nbsp;Palace midfielder had to withdraw from the September camp and saw his place go to <strong>Ruben&nbsp;Loftus-Cheek</strong>. There was then no room for Wharton this month. But if a player with his passing range continues to thrive for Palace it would surely be a mistake for Tuchel to leave him out.</p> <p>Competition is fierce. <strong>Phil Foden</strong> is an extravagant talent but was a high‑profile omission this time and could be squeezed out because of the number of creators available to Tuchel. <strong>Jack Grealish</strong> is in a similar spot. <strong>Jarrod Bowen</strong> has been in the past two squads but is in a struggling West Ham team and may be reliant on an injury to Madueke. <strong>Morgan&nbsp;Gibbs-White</strong> is in Tuchel’s thoughts but has to lift his form at Nottingham Forest. </p>    <p>One thing in Bowen’s favour is his ability to play up front. Tuchel namechecked him as a potential striker option if Kane is injured. He also mentioned Chelsea’s <strong>Liam&nbsp;Delap</strong>, who is out with a long‑term hamstring injury.</p> <p>Another Chelsea player who could make a late bolt is <strong>Levi&nbsp;Colwill</strong>. The defender is out with a serious knee injury but was excellent at the Club World Cup. The Bayer&nbsp;Leverkusen defender <strong>Jarell&nbsp;Quansah</strong> also has a chance. Manchester City’s <strong>Nico O’Reilly </strong>and<strong> Rico Lewis</strong> could challenge Lewis-Skelly.</p> <h2 data-note-id="f4c3a935-4984-416a-8a92-7dd400c3f3c3" data-type="subhead"><strong>On the sofa</strong></h2> <p><strong>Kyle Walker</strong>’s time is up and Tuchel seems unmoved by <strong>Trent&nbsp;Alexander-Arnold</strong>, partly because of his doubts over the Real Madrid right-back’s defensive nous. <strong>Trevoh Chalobah</strong> did not do enough with his opportunity against Senegal in June, <strong>Harry&nbsp;Maguire</strong> is too up and down at Manchester United and <strong>Eric&nbsp;Dier</strong>’s hopes look remote. Everton’s <strong>Jarrad Branthwaite</strong> is injured. The Newcastle goalkeepers <strong>Aaron&nbsp;Ramsdale</strong> and <strong>Nick Pope</strong> probably have to brace themselves for disappointment. </p> <p><strong>Conor Gallagher</strong> and <strong>Curtis&nbsp;Jones</strong> have fallen from favour in midfield. Tuchel loved <strong>Mason&nbsp;Mount</strong> at Chelsea but the United midfielder has not played for England since the 2022 World&nbsp;Cup. <strong>Kobbie Mainoo</strong>, who started in the European Championship final, and <strong>Angel&nbsp;Gomes </strong>have not caught Tuchel’s eye. <strong>Harvey Elliott</strong>, who starred for the Under-21s last summer, has too many players in front of him and it is probably a tournament too soon for <strong>Jobe Bellingham</strong> and <strong>Ethan&nbsp;Nwaneri</strong>. It is telling that Tuchel did not mention <strong>Ivan&nbsp;Toney</strong> or <strong>Dominic&nbsp;Solanke</strong> when he named potential stand-ins for Kane.</p>
