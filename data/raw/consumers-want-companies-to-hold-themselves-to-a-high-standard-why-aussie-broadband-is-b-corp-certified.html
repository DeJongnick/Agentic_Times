<p>As consumers, we tend to expect more these days from the businesses we support with our hard-earned dollars. Research shows we’re increasingly looking for markers of good when we buy, whether they reflect commitments to sustainability, diversity or social justice. We don’t just want the best product or service; we want to know we’re choosing a business that reflects our values and considers its impact on the world.</p> <p>It’s not always easy to know which companies are doing the right thing. But fortunately, there’s one big green flag to look for: B Corporation (or ‘B Corp’) certification. Whether we’re shopping for new clothes, a bar of chocolate or an essential service such as internet access, B Corp certification is a sign that the business ticks some very important boxes.</p> <h2>Why B Corps matter</h2> <p>B Corp certification isn’t just some rubber stamp or social lip service; it’s the result of a real process that requires applicant businesses to prove they meet stringent criteria.</p> <p>“Certified B Corps are businesses that are verified by B Lab to meet high standards of environmental and social performance across five impact areas, agree to be transparent about this performance, and commit to accountability to all stakeholders,” says Cameron Foley, the community impact manager with internet service provider Aussie Broadband.</p>    <p>Those <a href="https://kb.bimpactassessment.net/en/support/solutions/articles/43000574683-impact-areas-governance-workers-community-environment-and-customers" rel="nofollow">impact areas</a> are governance (including the company’s mission, ethics and transparency); workers (a commitment to policies that benefit workers); community (including overall community impact, diversity and charitable giving); environment (including how the business approaches environmental management practices and its impact on air, climate, water, land and biodiversity); and customers (including product quality and the ethical treatment of customers).</p> <p>While a business can hold itself to these standards independently, B Corp certification offers clear goalposts, community transparency and authenticity, which Foley says is vital for today’s socially minded consumers.</p> <p>“Consumers that are drawn to purpose-driven companies view their purchases as an extension of their identity, and as a result they want to do business with companies that reflect their ethics, their views on sustainability, and social justice,” he says. “They want to know that the company they are supporting is authentic and not simply greenwashing.”</p> <h2>Aussie Broadband, B Corp</h2> <p>One business living its values is Foley’s employer, Aussie Broadband. Over an 18-month process, it undertook an assessment that included more than 200 detailed questions about the business and its operations, and it is required to resubmit for certification every three years. It’s a complex, time-consuming process, but it’s one that Foley says is critical for Aussie Broadband in demonstrating its core values to its customers.</p> <p>“For many years now, one of our company values has always been ‘be good to people’,” Foley says. “But it doesn’t just mean being good to <em>our</em> people; we want to leave a positive impact on our customers, the communities in which we live and operate, and the world in which our customers live, too.”</p> <p>For Aussie Broadband, this has meant taking greater initiative to drive change as a newly crowned B Corp. Foley says the business has since accelerated its transition to 100% renewable energy on its owned and operated sites, and begun using the <a href="https://www.givvable.com/" rel="nofollow">Givvable</a> platform to track the environmental credentials of its supply chain partners. Considering the potential for e-waste in the telco industry, Aussie Broadband has also partnered with <a href="https://www.zolo.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Zolo</a> to recycle and repurpose devices such as laptops and modems.</p>    <p>On the social side, Aussie Broadband has expanded its charity product discount program, <a href="https://www.aussiebroadband.com.au/about-us/community/helping-communities-connect/" rel="nofollow">Helping Communities Connect</a>. The initiative, which now supports more than 1,100 partners, offers discounts and digital empowerment to charities, not-for-profits and Indigenous-owned businesses.</p> <h2>Be good to people</h2> <p>As we head into an increasingly digital future, the businesses that facilitate the transition will only grow in importance. Choosing utilities such as the internet is no longer just about getting great service, world-class speeds and value for money. Foley says mindful consumers are looking hard for companies that reflect their core beliefs, such as greater care for the environment, society and employees.</p> <p>“There is a growing number of environmentally and socially conscious consumers who highly value purpose-driven businesses that take care of their people and the places in which they operate,” Foley says.</p> <p>“Consumers want companies to hold themselves to a high standard, and to be transparent and accountable about their impact on the environment and society.”</p> <p><em><strong><a href="https://www.aussiebroadband.com.au/internet/nbn-plans/#builder" rel="nofollow">Browse internet plans using Aussie Broadband’s local, purpose-built network</a></strong></em></p>
