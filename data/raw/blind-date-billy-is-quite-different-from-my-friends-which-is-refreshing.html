<h2><strong>Billy on Phoebe</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>What were you hoping for?</strong><br>To meet someone different who I may never have met through friends or apps.</p> 
<p><strong>First impressions?</strong><br>Phoebe was immediately very welcoming and easy to talk to.</p> 
<p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong><br>Travelling, studying, living at home in adulthood, and surviving our previous jobs in the public sector. We also found out we grew up close to each other, and she has been working for the university where I did my PhD – small world. </p> 
<p><strong>Most awkward moment?</strong><br>Probably asking for the bill. We didn’t want to look like dine and dashers. </p> 
<p><strong>Good table manners?</strong><br>Faultless. She was much more on top of keeping our waters filled, which felt a bit ungentlemanly on my part. </p> 
<p><strong>Best thing about Phoebe?</strong><br>She is so down-to-earth and easy to chat with.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you introduce Phoebe to your&nbsp;friends?</strong><br>I’d be happy to. But I think I’d be doing so as a friend (spoiler alert).</p> 
<p><strong>Describe Phoebe in three words</strong><br>Warm, cultured, adventurous.</p>

    <p>Blind date is Saturday’s dating column: every week, two strangers are paired up for dinner and drinks, and then spill the beans to us, answering a set of questions. This runs, with a photograph we take of each dater before the date, in Saturday magazine (in the UK) and online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date">theguardian.com</a>&nbsp;every Saturday. It’s been running since 2009 – you can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/31/10-years-of-blind-date-weddings-babies-lost-knickers">read all about how we put it together here</a>.<br><br><b>What questions will I be asked?</b><br>We ask about age, location, occupation, hobbies, interests and the type of person you are looking to meet. If you do not think these questions cover everything you would like to know, tell us what’s on your mind.</p>
    <p><b>Can I choose who I match with?</b><br>No, it’s a blind date! But we do ask you a bit about your interests, preferences, etc – the more you tell us, the better the match is likely to be.</p>
    <p><b>Can I pick the photograph?</b><br>No, but don't worry: we'll choose the nicest ones.</p>
    <p><b>What personal details will appear?</b><br>Your first name, job and age.</p>
    <p><b>How should I answer?</b><br>Honestly but respectfully. Be mindful of how it will read to your date, and that Blind date reaches a large audience, in print and online.</p>
    <p><b>Will I see the other person’s answers?<br></b>No. We may edit yours and theirs for a range of reasons, including length, and we may ask you for more details.</p>
    <p><b>Will you find me The One?<br></b>We’ll try! Marriage! Babies!</p>
    <p><b>Can I do it in my home town?<br></b>Only if it’s in the UK. Many of our applicants live in London, but we would love to hear from people living elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think Phoebe made of&nbsp;you?</strong><br>I think we got on well, so I hope she found me good company.</p> 
<p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong><br>Just a quick wander back to the station.</p> 
<p><strong>And </strong><strong>… did you kiss?</strong><br>We didn’t, just a hug by the barriers. I&nbsp;don’t think either of us were feeling that sort of vibe from the evening.</p> 
<p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</strong><br>I would’ve ordered some of the non-alcoholic wine Phoebe was drinking; it looked intriguing.</p> 
<p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong><br>7.5. I had a great time, but I don’t think there was any romantic spark.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you meet again?</strong><br>I don’t think another date is on the cards, but I’d be up for a catchup at some point.</p> 
<h2>Phoebe on Billy</h2> 
<p><strong>What were you hoping for?</strong><br>A south London accent.</p> 
<p><strong>First impressions?</strong><br>South London, no accent.</p> 
<p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong><br>Feeling 16 again, karaoke, hope for a&nbsp;new left wing, favourite books. I also learned that budgies can argue like siblings – Billy has two: Egg and Yolky.</p> 
<p><strong>Most awkward moment?</strong><br>My lateness … very unlike me.</p> 
<p><strong>Good table manners?</strong><br>I was glad he was up for trying the golden beetroot. </p> 
<p><strong>Best thing about Billy?</strong><br>His contentment – something I&nbsp;often&nbsp;lack.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you introduce Billy to your&nbsp;friends?</strong><br>Billy is quite different from my friends, which was refreshing, but I’m not sure they have much in common.</p> 
<p><strong>Describe Billy in three words</strong><br>Sweet, optimistic, and genuine.</p> 
<p><strong>What do you think Billy made of you?</strong><br>Maybe a bit chaotic, and more spontaneous than I really am. (I’m not&nbsp;sure anyone is ever their true self&nbsp;on a first date.)</p> 
<p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong><br>No.</p> 
<p><strong>And</strong><strong> … did you kiss?</strong><br>We did not.</p> 
<p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</strong><br>I wish we had sat outside.</p> 
<p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong><br>Overall, 7.5. I hadn’t expected to&nbsp;have&nbsp;such a nice evening with a&nbsp;total&nbsp;stranger.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you meet again?</strong><br>No, I think we are looking for different things – and maybe different people.</p>
