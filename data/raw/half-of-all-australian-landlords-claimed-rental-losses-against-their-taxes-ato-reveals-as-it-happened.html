He was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/06/victoria-police-chief-commissioner-mike-bush">announced as Shane Patton’s replacement last month</a>.</p> <p>Allan says Bush comes to the role with significant experience, having led New Zealand police for six years and overseeing “some of the nation’s most difficult and challenging of times”, including the Christchurch terror attack and the White Island volcano eruption.</p> <p>She says he also “transformed” NZ police, increased public trust and saw the crime rate go down. It’s hoped he will do the same in Victoria, where the latest crime statistics released last week showed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/19/victorias-crime-rate-surges-with-young-offenders-contributing-to-record-arrests">a 15% increase in offending</a>, driven in part by a surge in youth crime.</p>    <p>Bush told reporters “there’s too much crime, there’s too much youth crime”. He says he will seek to instil more trust in police, introduce more technology, information and intelligence and bring a crime prevention mindset to the role. Bush says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Whenever you go into any scenario, any situation, it might be family home, it might be a burglary – whatever – where there’s a victim, we’ve got to start thinking, ‘I’m not just here to respond and identify who might be the [offender]’. That’s important, but you’ve got to start thinking about, how do we never come back here? How do we make sure this person is never victimised again? And that’s a mindset. So they’re not just thinking response and investigation, resolved. They’re thinking of preventing harm for this person again.

cast coming and going over the three days).</p> <p>The treasurer says the roundtable will focus on coming up with ideas to boost the country’s flagging productivity, and to help deliver as broad as possible a consensus for reform.</p> <p>So far, Chalmers has highlighted tax as a major area of inquiry.</p> <p>The public consultation process leading up to the roundtable opens tonight.</p> <p>More invitations will be issued “in tranches” to experts, stakeholders and other lobby groups, Chalmers said in a statement.</p>    <p>“We know there’s broad interest and engagement in the roundtable, including from the states and crossbench, and we will have more to say about their involvement,” he said.</p> <p>Somebody like independent MP, <strong>Allegra Spender,</strong> would hope to get an invite based on her advocacy and work on tax reform ideas.</p> <p>The shadow treasurer, <strong>Ted O’Brien,</strong> has already been offered and accepted an invitation.</p> <p>Here are the initial invitees:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Danielle Wood,</strong> chair, Productivity Commission</p></li> <li><p><strong>Sally McManus,</strong> secretary, Australian Council of Trade Unions</p></li>

alleged incriminating conduct</strong></p> <p>The judge in<strong> Erin Patterson’s</strong> triple murder trial has told jurors “there are all sorts of reasons” why an innocent person may behave in a way that makes them appear guilty.</p> <p>Justice <strong>Christopher Beale</strong> says jurors can only treat alleged incriminating conduct in the case as an implied admission of guilt if they find the “only reasonable explanation of that conduct” is that Patterson believes she committed the offences.</p> <p>He says if the jury reaches this position, it still needs to determine whether the prosecution has proved her guilt of the charges beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p>“There are all sorts of reasons why a person might behave in a way that makes the person look guilty and yet not be guilty,” he says.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Even if you think the conduct makes the accused look guilty, that does not necessarily mean the accused is guilty.</p> </blockquote> <p>Beale previously outlined Patterson’s alleged incriminating conduct, which the prosecution is relying on, including discharging herself from Leongtha hospital against medical advice, dumping the dehydrator in the days after the fateful lunch and lies in her formal police interview.</p> <p>Regarding discharging herself from hospital against medical advice, Beale says there is evidence about two previous occasions where Patterson did this.</p> <p>Regarding the dumping of the dehydrator, Beale tells jurors to consider whether Patterson might have panicked due to fear of being blamed for the deaths of the lunch guests.</p> <p>Beale says he will conclude his instructions to the jury on Monday.
