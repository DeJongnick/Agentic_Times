The state recently secured a stockpile of 2m abortion pills in response to the ruling to block mifepristone.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/RepJoshG/status/1646963883544834048">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, I&#39;m leading and introducing the Freedom to Decide Act w/ <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJasmine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RepJasmine</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAngieCraig?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RepAngieCraig</a> to protect doctor-prescribed access to the abortion pill mifepristone &amp; to support telemedicine across state lines.<br><br>Endorsed by <a href="https://twitter.com/PPact?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PPact</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NARAL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NARAL</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nwlc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NWLC</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/ReproRights?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ReproRights</a> — read our bill here: <a href="https://t.co/tKWicRGrqE">pic.twitter.com/tKWicRGrqE</a></p>&mdash; Rep Josh Gottheimer (@RepJoshG) <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJoshG/status/1646963883544834048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2023</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>“The freedom to decide act affirms what we all know,” Gottheimer wrote on Twitter announcing the bill. “Access to mifepristone does not violate federal law and it is essential to protecting the fundamental right for all women to make personal, private health care decisions about their own bodies, lives, and futures.”</p> <p>Highlighting that the pill has been available for more than 2 decades and circulates in roughly 80 countries, the legislators behind the bill emphasized its safety record even when prescribed via telemedicine.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2023-04-14T21:24:31.215Z">at 10.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6439b9808f0891526bb42d82" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2023-04-14T20:53:38.317Z">9.53pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The ruling from Alito, a conservative justice, has ensured access to the drug will continue – for now.
