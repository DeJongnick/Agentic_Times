<p>I read the article by Larry Elliott with interest and thought I could suggest one small act of rebellion that is easily in the chancellor’s hands and could raise substantial sums of money (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/11/france-rachel-reeves-bond-market-britain-labour-economic-orthodoxy">Let France be a warning, Rachel Reeves: stand up to the bond market vigilantes, or they’ll come for Britain next, 11 September</a>).</p> <p>At the moment, interest on the vast majority of government borrowing is paid to banks, pension funds and other lenders, a significant proportion of which are based overseas. Interest paid on&nbsp;those borrowings varies, but can&nbsp;exceed 5%.</p> <p>While we are largely in the hands of these “bond market bullies”, we have our own bond market that is available to tap into. At the moment about £130bn is held in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/sep/02/premium-bonds-worth-investing-odds-of-winning">premium bonds</a>, which pay out an equivalent&nbsp;interest rate of 3.6%, almost entirely to UK&nbsp;citizens.</p> <p>Almost half of that £130bn is in the hands of individuals holding the maximum of £50,000. If that maximum holding limit were to be increased, the government would receive a considerable influx of funds at the cost of a relatively low&nbsp;interest rate. </p> <p>UK banks and building societies might complain about unfair competition, but surely the need of the exchequer for additional funds (without raising taxes) comes first. <br><strong>Phil Spence</strong><br><em>Tenby, Pembrokeshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
