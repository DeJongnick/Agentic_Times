<p>Genesis P-Orridge was the performance artist, shaman and lead singer of Throbbing Gristle who was born as Neil Megson in Manchester in 1950, but from the 90s lived in the US. P-Orridge challenged gender identity but it is clear from the interviewees that there were no wrong answers when it came to pronouns: “he”, “she” and “they” are all used. This is a sympathetic and amiable official docu-biography in which the subject comes across as a mix of Aleister Crowley, Charles Manson and Screaming Lord Sutch. The “P-Orridge” surname makes me suspect that Spike Milligan might have been an indirect influence, although there’s also a bit of Klaus Kinski in there as well.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/10/genesis-p-orridge-throbbing-gristle">Genesis P-Orridge: fantastic transgressor or sadistic aggressor?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Genesis P-Orridge, known to friends and family as Gen, started as a radical conceptual artist, rule-breaker, consciousness-expander and tabloid-baiter who with Throbbing Gristle <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/15/genesis-p-orridge-troubling-catalyst-who-loathed-rock-yet-changed-it-for-ever">influentially coined the term “industrial music”</a>, a term later to be borrowed without acknowledgment by many. They were, in the words of Janet Street-Porter, shown here in archive footage, “too shocking for punk”. P-Orridge formed a new band, Psychic TV, in the 1980s, and then also formed a group of likeminded occultist provocateurs called Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. (The film tactfully passes over how very annoying that spelling is.)</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxc-av6FRPs"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pxc-av6FRPs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>At the beginning of the 90s, P-Orridge and his family, including first wife Paula P-Orridge, went to the US to escape a (later retracted) allegation of ritual sexual abuse. In the US, they were the guests of counterculture figure Michael Horowitz, father of Winona Ryder, and P-Orridge’s career in art, music and peripheral celebrity blossomed. After divorce from Paula, P-Orridge married the artist Jacqueline Breyer, known as Lady Jaye, with whom Gen pursued a radical project of “pandrogynous” fusion, involving breast and lip surgery.</p> <p>By the end, there is maybe a you-had-to-be-there factor with all this, and the film leaves you with a nagging feeling that P-Orridge was not seriously important in either art or music – but was pugnaciously sincere, too unselfconscious to be a narcissist and certainly a real one-off.</p> <p>• S/he Is Still Her/e: The Official Genesis P-Orridge Doc is in UK and Irish cinemas from 20 June.</p>
