 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It is almost 6.30pm in Kyiv and Moscow. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Russia-Ukraine war coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/aug/16/putin-trump-summit-alaska-us-europe-ukraine-security-guarantees-zelenskyy-latest-news-updates">here</a>.</p> 
  <p>Here’s a recap of the developments from today:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet president Trump in Washington on Monday after Trumps’s summit with Putin resulted in no ceasefire deal</strong>. The US and Russian leaders met on a red carpet laid down for them at a US military base in the former Russian territory of Alaska, and spent about three hours in private talks, with top foreign policy aides, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Regarding the upcoming meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump wrote in a post on social media platform Truth Social that, “If it all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin. Potentially, millions of people’s lives will be saved.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump publicly dropped plans for an immediate ceasefire he had himself championed for months, instead embracing Putin’s preferred path</strong> of pushing through a far-reaching “Peace Agreement” before halting any fighting. “Unfortunately, Trump has taken Putin’s position, and this was Putin’s demand,” <strong>Oleksandr Merezhko</strong>, the head of the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, told Reuters on Saturday.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Speaking to German public broadcaster ZDF, chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Saturday that <strong>the United States was ready to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine</strong>. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen also said in a post on X that strong security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe were “essential” in any peace deal to end the war in Ukraine.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump’s debriefing to European leaders after the Alaska summit with Putin included discussions about security guarantees for Ukraine,</strong> which is outside Nato. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the guarantees would be equivalent to article 5, which states that if a Nato ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this as an armed attack against all members. Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said that the discussion of security guarantees was area where “most interesting developments” happened during the Trump-Putin Alaska summit.</p></li> 
   <li><p>After a debriefing from president Trump, <strong>the European Commission released a joint pledge to back Ukraine,</strong> emphasising that “Ukraine must have ironclad security guarantees to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We welcome President Trump’s statement that the US is prepared to give security guarantees. The coalition of the willing is ready to play an active role. No limitations should be placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries. Russia cannot have a veto against Ukraine’s pathway to EU and Nato. It will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must not be changed by force.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Several European leaders lauded Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine.</strong> UK prime minister <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> said in a statement: “President Trump’s efforts have brought us closer than ever before to ending Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine. His leadership in pursuit of an end to the killing should be commended.” The Czech foreign minister <strong>Jan Lipavský</strong> said he was “glad that President Trump is trying to stop the war” but that there has been “propagandistic nonsense about the ‘roots of the conflict’” from Putin in the subsequent press conference.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>European leaders have been invited to attend the Monday meeting</strong> with US president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, the New York Times reported on Saturday, citing two senior European officials.</p></li> 
   <li><p>During the Alaska meeting, <strong>Putin told Trump that he would freeze the frontline in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in exchange for the Donetsk region of Ukraine</strong>, according to a Financial Times report. In a statement posted on the social media platform X earlier on Saturday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said: “All issues important to Ukraine must be discussed with Ukraine’s participation, and no issue, particularly territorial ones, can be decided without Ukraine.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia may step up its attacks on Ukraine following the inconclusive Putin-Trump summit</strong> and the news that the Ukrainian leader would fly to Washington to meet the US president on Monday.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Two people were killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on Russia’s Kursk region</strong>, the local governor said on Saturday.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A blast at a factory in the Russian region of Ryazan on Friday killed 11 people and left 130 injured</strong>, Russia’s emergencies ministry said on Saturday. Some Russian media outlets reported that the explosion was caused by gunpowder catching fire.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Russian defence ministry said its forces had taken Kolodyazi village in Ukraine’s Donetsk region</strong>, according to state media reports on Saturday. The Guardian could not independently verify battlefield reports.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump reportedly hand-delivered a letter from his wife, Melania, to Putin at the meeting.</strong> The letter raised the plight of children abducted during the war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> – for which Putin is wanted by the international criminal court – White House officials said, without providing further details.</p></li>

  <p>Poland’s prime minister, <strong>Donald Tusk</strong>, has warned that the battle for Ukraine’s future and European security has reached a “decisive phase” as he urged the west to maintain unity in its opposition to Vladimir Putin, who he labelled a “cunning and ruthless player”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The game for Ukraine’s future, Poland’s security, and all of Europe has entered a decisive phase. Today, it is even clearer that Russia respects only the strong, and Putin has once again proven to be a cunning and ruthless player. Therefore, maintaining the unity of the entire West is so important.</p>

  <p>Earlier this week, US president Donald Trump at the last minute requested Maga-allied Polish president <strong>Karol Nawrocki</strong> join the Ukraine teleconference with European leaders on Wednesday, according to centrist Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, who had initally been expected to attend. Nawrocki, not Tusk, was present on the call between Trump and European leaders on Friday night after the summit with Putin in Alaska.</p> 
  <p>Nawrocki, a conservative nationalist and Eurosceptic, is an ally of Trump’s right-wing populist Maga political movement and visited the White House during Poland’s presidential election campaign this year.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Agence France-Presse has been speaking to some ordinary Ukrainians to get their view of the summit, and it’s fair to say they are pretty unimpressed.</p> 
  <p>Pavlo Nebroev stayed up until the middle of the night in Kharkiv, which has suffered repeated Russian bombardments, to wait for the press conference. The 38-year-old theatre manager said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I saw the results I expected. I think this is a great diplomatic victory for Putin. He has completely legitimised himself.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Nebroev, like many Ukrainians, was gobsmacked the meeting could take place without representatives of his country.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This was a useless meeting. Issues concerning Ukraine should be resolved with Ukraine, with the participation of Ukrainians, the president.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Olya Donik, 36, said she was not surprised by the turn of events as she walked through a sunny park in Kharkiv with Nebroev.</p> 
  <p>“It ended with nothing. Alright, let’s continue living our lives here in Ukraine,” she said.</p> 
  <p>“Whether there are talks or not, Kharkiv is being shelled almost every day. Kharkiv definitely doesn’t feel any change,” said Iryna Derkach, a 50-year-old photographer.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We believe in victory, we know it will come, but God only knows who exactly will bring it about”.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Derkach, like many Ukrainians, was suspicious of Trump. “We do our job and don’t pay too much attention to what Trump is doing,” she added.</p> 
  <p>Pharmacist Larysa Melnyk did not think her country was any closer to seeing peace.</p> 
  <p>“I don’t think there will be a truce,” she told AFP, adding that even if the guns fall silent, it will only be temporarily.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Key event</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Russia’s reaction to Donald Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska has been nothing short of jubilant,</strong> with Moscow celebrating the fact that the Russian leader met his US counterpart without making concessions and now faces no sanctions despite rejecting Trump’s ceasefire demands.</p> 
  <p>“The meeting proved that negotiations are possible without preconditions,” wrote former president Dmitry Medvedev on Telegram. He added that the summit showed that talks could continue as Russia wages war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p> 
  <p>Trump entered the high-stakes summit warning, “I won’t be happy if I walk away without some form of a ceasefire,” and threatening “severe consequences” if Moscow refused to cooperate.</p> 
  <p>But after a three-hour meeting with the Russian side that yielded no tangible results, Trump shelved his threats and instead insisted that the meeting was “extremely productive,” even as Putin clung to his maximalist demands for ending the war and announced no concessions on the battlefield, where Russian forces are consolidating key gains in eastern Ukraine.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a post on X that strong security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe were “essential” in any peace deal to end the war in Ukraine.</p>

  <p>The French president, <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong>, said in a statement on X that France would work with the US and partners in the “coalition of the willing” to make progress on a lasting peace with security guarantees. That coalition will meet in the near future, Macron added.</p> 
  <p>The spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry, <strong>Randhir Jaiswal</strong>, said on Saturday: “The way forward can only be through dialogue and diplomacy. The world wants to see an early end to the conflict in Ukraine.”</p> 
  <p>The Slovak prime minister, <strong>Robert Fico</strong>, who has diverged from most western allies by visiting Moscow twice since last year and refusing to provide official military aid to Ukraine, said in a recorded statement on Facebook: “The coming days will show whether the big players in the Union will support this process … or whether the unsuccessful European strategy of trying to weaken Russia through this conflict with all kinds of literally incredible financial, political or military assistance to Kyiv will continue.”</p>

  <p>A senior Ukrainian parliamentarian said on Saturday that by proposing to abandon a ceasefire agreement in favour of a peace agreement, Trump is taking Vladimir Putin’s position. <br><br>“Unfortunately, Trump has taken Putin’s position, and this was Putin’s demand,” Oleksandr Merezhko, the head of the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, told Reuters.</p> 
  <p>“In Putin’s view, a peace agreement means several dangerous things – Ukraine not joining Nato, his absurd demands for denazification and demilitarisation, the Russian language and the Russian church,” he said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer: Trump's efforts have brought us closer to ending war in Ukraine</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has released an official statement on Ukraine after the Alaska summit held between president Trump and president Putin.</p> 
  <p>The statement said: “President Trump’s efforts have brought us closer than ever before to ending Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine. His leadership in pursuit of an end to the killing should be commended.”</p> 
  <p>It echoed the joint statement released by the European Council by reiterating: “the next step must be further talks involving President Zelenskyy. The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without him.”</p> 
  <p>Starmer continued: “This morning, I spoke to President Zelenskyy, President Trump and other European partners, and we all stand ready to support this next phase.</p> 
  <p>I welcome the openness of the United States, alongside Europe, to provide robust security guarantees to Ukraine as part of any deal. This is important progress and will be crucial in deterring Putin from coming back for more.</p> 
  <p>In the meantime, until he stops his barbaric assault, we will keep tightening the screws on his war machine with even more sanctions, which have already had a punishing impact on the Russian economy and its people.</p> 
  <p>Our unwavering support for Ukraine will continue as long as it takes.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">European Council pledges to back Ukraine in joint statement on Trump-Putin summit</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The European Council have released a joint statement by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, the European Council president, António Costa and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.</p> 
  <p>The statement, in response to Trump’s meeting with Putin in Alaska which secured no peace agreement, said: “Leaders welcomed President Trump’s efforts to stop the killing in Ukraine, end Russia’s war of aggression, and achieve just and lasting peace.</p> 
  <p>As President Trump said ‘there’s no deal until there’s a deal’. As envisioned by President Trump, the next step must now be further talks including President Zelenskyy, whom he will meet soon.</p> 
  <p>We are also ready to work with President Trump and President Zelenskyy towards a trilateral summit with European support.”</p> 
  <p>The statement emphasised that “Ukraine must have ironclad security guarantees to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We welcome President Trump’s statement that the US is prepared to give security guarantees. The coalition of the willing is ready to play an active role. No limitations should be placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries. Russia cannot have a veto against Ukraine’s pathway to EU and Nato.</p> 
  <p>It will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must not be changed by force.”</p> 
  <p>It added: “Our support to Ukraine will continue. We are determined to do more to keep Ukraine strong in order to achieve an end to the fighting and a just and lasting peace.</p> 
  <p>As long as the killing in Ukraine continues, we stand ready to uphold the pressure on Russia. We will continue to strengthen sanctions and wider economic measures to put pressure on Russia’s war economy until there is a just and lasting peace.</p> 
  <p>Ukraine can count on our unwavering solidarity as we work towards a peace that safeguards Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>There has been speculation on the social media platform X about an air ceasefire, according to reports from Oliver Carroll, a foreign correspondent for the Economist.</p> 
  <p>Carroll said on Saturday: “I’m told there is provisional agreement of an air ceasefire until 3-way leaders meeting. ‘We think the skies will give signals about provisional results of these talks,’ source tells me. ‘The next week will be interesting.’”</p> 
  <p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s communication adviser Dmytro Lytvyn responded to the post, writing: “We haven’t heard anything about it yet”.</p> 
  <p>There have been no reports of a ceasefire deal from Washington or Moscow.</p>

  <p>The Ryazan regional governor, Pavel Malkov, said on Friday that the incident had been triggered by a fire breaking out inside a workshop at the factory.</p> 
  <p>There was no cause given for the fire, not was it clear what the factory produced. Ukrainian drones have previously targeted military and economic infrastructure in Ryazan region. In January, a major oil refinery and power station had been hit by Ukrainian drones.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke on the phone with Donald Trump and European partners on Saturday morning after the meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the Élysée office said in a statement on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>The phone conversation lasted for one hour and other there were seven other European leaders present, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Friedrich Merz, Keir Starmer, Giorgia Meloni, Alexander Stubb and Karol Nawrocki, as well as the secretary general of Nato, Mark Rutte, the statement said.</p> 
  <p>We are yet to hear from Sir Keir Starmer’s government, but other European politicians have been reacting.</p> 
  <p><strong>Italy’s</strong> deputy PM, Matteo Salvini said: “Every step forward towards peace, like this one, is good news. As Pope Leo said, may diplomacy speak again in place of weapons, without anyone obstructing it.”</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Norwegian </strong>foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, said: “President Putin of Russia reiterated known arguments, such as emphasising the so-called ‘root causes’ of the war, which is code for the Russian justification for the illegal invasion of Ukraine.” He added it was important to keep pressure on Russia and listen to Ukraine’s wishes and needs.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Czech</strong> foreign minister Jan Lipavský said he was “glad that President Trump is trying to stop the war” but that there has been “propagandistic nonsense about the ‘roots of the conflict’” from Putin in the subsequent press conference.</p> 
  <p>“The problem is Russian imperialism, not Ukraine’s desire to live freely,” he continued. “If Putin were serious about negotiating peace, he would not have been attacking Ukraine all day today.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Lithuania’s</strong> defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, accused Putin of making “some more gaslighting and veiled threats” towards Ukraine and Europe in the press conference, in which the Russian leader said he hoped the countries “will not try to sabotage the talks”.</p> 
  <p><strong>Hungary’s</strong> PM, Viktor Orbán, wrote on Facebook: “For years, we have watched the two largest nuclear powers eliminate the framework of their cooperation and send messages to each other.” He added “It’s over now. The world is a safer place today than it was yesterday.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Medvedev: negotiations possible during Russian war effort</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Russia’s initial reaction to the Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin summit has been decisively positive, with Moscow highlighting that the Russian leader met his US counterpart without making concessions and now faces no sanctions despite rejecting Trump’s ceasefire demands.</p> 
  <p>“The meeting proved that negotiations are possible without preconditions and simultaneously with the continuation of the ‘special military operation’,” wrote the former president Dmitry Medvedev on Telegram, using Russia’s preferred term for its invasion of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Medvedev, now the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, welcomed the fact that Putin was able to “personally and in detail present” Russia’s maximalist conditions for ending the war. In Alaska, Putin repeated his familiar line that the “root causes” of the conflict must be addressed – demands that in practice would severely limit Ukraine’s sovereignty.</p> 
  <p>He also picked up on Trump’s remarks that the pressure now lies with Kyiv, indirectly referring to the US president’s blunt message that Zelenskyy “gotta make a deal”.</p> 
  <p>“Both sides directly placed responsibility for achieving future results in negotiations on ending military actions on Kyiv and Europe,” Medvedev wrote.</p> 
  <p>Russian state media and the Kremlin elite were already in high spirits as Trump rolled out the red carpet for Putin, who is wanted by The Hague for war crimes.</p> 
  <p>“Western media are on the verge of completely losing it,” wrote the foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova as Putin landed in Alaska.</p> 
  <p>“For three years they told everyone Russia was isolated and today they saw a beautiful red carpet laid out for the Russian president in the US,” she added.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary so far</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>For those joining us now, here’s what you might have missed.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> and <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> met on a red carpet laid down for them at a US military base in the former Russian territory of Alaska, and spent about three hours in private talks, with top foreign policy aides, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian observers were horrified that Trump laid out a red carpet for Putin, and even applauded him.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The meeting, billed as a summit, came to an end much earlier than scheduled, after the first of what was supposed to have been two rounds of talks.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Reporters were summoned for what was billed as a joint news conference, but were instead treated to a pair of brief statements that lasted, in total, 12 minutes. After Putin claimed that some sort of agreement had been reached, Trump said that there had been ‘no deal’ and then abruptly ended the event, taking no questions.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The White House said Trump has had a “lengthy” call with the Ukrainian president, <strong>Volodymyr</strong> <strong>Zelenskyy</strong>, and Nato leaders, on the plane after the meeting before he returned to DC.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The meeting was criticised by Democrats, some European officials, Ukrainian media outlets, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, and the former US national security advisor, <strong>John Bolton</strong>, who said “Putin clearly won”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>A Fox News reporter called it “really stunning” that Putin spoke first in the event.</p></li> 
   <li><p>In a post-summit interview with his supporter <strong>Sean Hannity</strong>, Trump said that the meeting with Putin had been “a 10” and suggested that Putin “spoke very sincerely” about his desire to end the war in Ukraine.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump also claimed to Hannity that Putin, the Russian autocrat who has jailed, exiled and killed political rivals who could challenge him in elections, told him that the 2020 US presidential election “was rigged” and “you can’t have an honest election with mail-in voting.’”</p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump reportedly hand-delivered a letter from his wife, <strong>Melania</strong>, to Putin at the meeting. The letter raised the plight of children abducted during the war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> – for which Putin is wanted by the international criminal court – White House officials said, without providing further details.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Overnight, Russia launched 85 attack drones and a ballistic missile targeting Ukraine’s territory, Ukraine’s air force said.</p></li> 
  </ul>

  <p>Few in Ukraine are surprised at the apparent lack of outcome in the Alaska summit. There was little to no expectation of progress towards a ceasefire, never mind an actual cessation of hostilities, given Putin’s long history of aggression and intransigence towards the country.</p> 
  <p>Though Trump said that the leaders had a “very productive meeting”, the look on his face suggested otherwise. Critical for Ukraine’s leadership today will be to understand if Putin’s maximalist negotiating position has adjusted at all - and how the US leader responded to the demands of his Russian counterpart.</p> 
  <p>Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said repeatedly that he did not believe that Putin was a good faith negotiator and has expressed the belief that Donald Trump would eventually conclude the same for himself. The hope in Kyiv will now be that Trump can be gently steered towards closer support for Ukraine and consider moving forward with measures such as secondary sanctions on Russia oil exports.</p> 
  <p>But there is also a grim anxiety. Russian missile and drone attacks into Ukraine have been reduced in the days running up to the summit. Now the meeting is over, the fear is that a return to large scale night time assaults could follow.</p>

  <p>Vladimir Putin remains determined to “revive the Soviet Union” by “destroying democracy next door”, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, <strong>Vasyl Myroshnychenko</strong>, has said.</p> 
  <p>Speaking to Australia’s national broadcaster, in the wake of the meeting, Myroshnychenko pushed back on Putin’s rhetoric about needing to solve the “root causes” of the conflict.</p> 
  <p>He said the root cause of the conflict from Putin’s perspective was a sovereign, independent and democratic Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>“When Putin talks about the ‘root cause of war’, it’s an independent Ukraine on the map of Europe. That’s the only cause of war for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a>,” he said.</p> 
  <p>“Putin is just out there on his mission to revive the Soviet Union, to revive the Russian empire, and it can’t be revived without Ukraine. Just overnight, as we speak, Russians have attacked many Ukrainian cities, sent many drones. So we don’t really see any indication of him ending his war.”</p>

  <p>More reaction from Europe to the meeting: the Czech defence minister, <strong>Jana Černochová</strong>, has said the summit showed that the Russian president is not looking for peace and wants to weaken western unity.</p> 
  <p>“The Trump-Putin talks in Alaska did not bring significant progress toward ending the war in Ukraine, but they confirmed that Putin is not seeking peace, but rather an opportunity to weaken western unity and spread his propaganda,” she wrote on X, adding that the west must continue supporting Ukraine.</p>

  <p>The Senate Democratic leader, <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong>, has accused Trump of rolling out the red carpet “for an authoritarian thug” in what was “just theatre”, not diplomacy.</p> 
  <p>“Instead of standing with Ukraine and our allies, Trump stood shoulder to shoulder with an autocrat that has terrorised the Ukrainian people and the globe for years,” Schumer said in a statement. </p> 
  <p>“While we wait for critical details of what was discussed- on first take it appears Trump handed Putin legitimacy, a global stage, zero accountability, and got nothing in return.”</p> 
  <p>Schumer has been joined by other Democrats in criticising the meeting.</p> 
  <p><strong>Ken Martin</strong>, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: “Donald Trump has been cozying up to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> for years, and this meeting underscored the depth of his sick obsession with the Russian dictator and accused war criminal.”</p> 
  <p>He added: “Trump has been clear that his foreign policy agenda is letting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> ‘do whatever the hell they want’ – no matter how disastrous for the US and our allies – and when put to the test, Trump embarrassed the United States by folding like a cheap suit.”</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile Democrat senator <strong>Mark Kelly</strong> told Trump he should “ink the deal first”.</p>

  <p>“We must continue to put pressure on Russia, and even increase it, to give the clear signal to Russia that it must pay the price [for its invasion of Ukraine],” Eide told reporters in Oslo.</p>

  <p><strong>David Smith</strong>, the Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief, has been in Anchorage for the meeting, which provided quite a bit of material for his political sketch:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>That was the moment he knew it was true love.</p> 
   <p>Donald Trump turned to gaze at Vladimir Putin as the Russian president publicly endorsed his view that, had Trump been president instead of Joe Biden, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">the war in Ukraine</a> would never have happened.</p> 
   <p>“Today President Trump was saying that if he was president back then, there would be no war, and I’m quite sure that it would indeed be so,” Putin said. “I can confirm that.”</p> 
   <p>Vladimir, you complete me, Trump might have replied. To hell with all those Democrats, democrats, wokesters, fake news reporters and factcheckers. Here is a man who speaks my authoritarian alternative facts language.</p> 
   <p>The damned doubters had been worried about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/15/trump-putin-alaska-meeting-ukraine">Friday’s big summit</a> at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a cold war-era airbase under a big sky and picturesque mountains on the outskirts of Anchorage, Alaska.</p> 
   <p>They feared that it might resemble Neville Chamberlain’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2018/sep/21/munich-chamberlain-hitler-appeasement-1938">appeasement of Adolf Hitler </a>in Munich 1938, or Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin carving up the world for the great powers at the Yalta Conference in 1945.</p>

  <p>“Sickening. Shameful. And in the end, useless.”</p> 
  <p>The Kyiv Independent has <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/editorial-that-was-sickening-was-it-necessary/">published a blistering editorial</a> on the Trump Putin meeting.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Trump didn’t get what he wanted. But Putin? He sure did.</p> 
   <p>From the moment he stepped off the plane on US soil, the Russian dictator was beaming.</p> 
   <p>No longer an international pariah, he was finally getting accepted – and respected — by the leader of the free world. Trump’s predecessor once called Putin a murderer; Trump offered him a king’s welcome.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The English-language Ukrainian outlet’s editorial compared the “king’s welcome” for Putin to Trump’s hostile reception of Zelenskyy in the Oval Office just six months ago.</p> 
  <p>“Ukraine’s president endured a public shaming. Russia’s was pampered. Both episodes were disgraceful,” it said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“Trump fails to grasp that Putin isn’t transactional about Ukraine – he is messianic. He wants Ukraine for Russia, period. For Putin and his inner circle, Ukraine’s independence is an accident, and they are correcting it.”</p>

  <p><strong>Trump hand delivered a letter from his wife, Melania, to Putin at the meeting, White House officials have told Reuters. The letter raised the plight of children abducted during the war in Ukraine, they said, without providing further details.</strong></p> 
  <p>Tens of thousands of Ukrainian children have been abducted, taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territories without the consent of families or guardians, which Ukraine has called a war crime that meets the UN treaty definition of genocide.</p> 
  <p>Putin has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for the alleged war crime of unlawful deportation and transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.</p> 
  <p>“There are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Putin bears individual criminal responsibility,” the charge says.</p> 
  <p>Moscow has previous said it has been protecting vulnerable children from a war zone.</p> 
  <p>Melania Trump was not on the Alaska trip, however she is emerging as one of the strongest influences on her husband, whose inner circle tends to shift as people fall in and out of favour.</p> 
  <p>Trump has credited <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/15/ukrainians-hail-melania-trump-for-challenging-husbands-faith-in-putin">the first lady’s scepticism</a> with sharpening his partial rethink about Putin. At a meeting with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on 15 July he said: “I go home. I tell the first lady: ‘I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.’ She said: ‘Oh really? Another city was just hit.’”</p> 
  <p>At another White House event that same day, he said: “I’d get home, I’d say: ‘First lady, I had the most wonderful talk with Vladimir. I think we’re finished.’ And then I’ll turn on the television, or she’ll say to me one time: ‘Wow, that’s strange because they just bombed a nursing home.’</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Interim summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We will continue to gather reaction and try to make sense of what happened in Anchorage, Alaska on Friday. In the meantime, here are some of the day’s developments so far:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> and <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> met on a red carpet laid down for them at a US military base in the former Russian territory of Alaska, and spent about three hours in private talks, with top foreign policy aides, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian observers were horrified that Trump laid out a red carpet for Putin, and even applauded him.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The meeting, billed as a summit, came to an end much earlier than scheduled, after the first of what was supposed to have been two rounds of talks. </p></li> 
   <li><p>Reporters were summoned for what was billed as a joint news conference, but were instead treated to a pair of brief statements that lasted, in total, 12 minutes. After Putin claimed that some sort of agreement had been reached, Trump said that there had been ‘no deal’ and then abruptly ended the event, taking no questions.</p></li> 
   <li><p>A Fox News reporter called it “really stunning” that Putin spoke first in the event.</p></li> 
   <li><p>In a post-summit interview with his supporter <strong>Sean Hannity</strong>, Trump said that the meeting with Putin had been “a 10” and suggested that Putin “spoke very sincerely” about his desire to end the war in Ukraine. </p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump also claimed to Hannity that Putin, the Russian autocrat who has jailed, exiled and killed political rivals who could challenge him in elections, told him that the 2020 US presidential election “was rigged” and “you can’t have an honest election with mail-in voting.’”</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">In 2024 debate, Harris told Trump that Putin 'would eat you for lunch' in Ukraine talks</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Eleven months ago, during a presidential debate, Kamala Harris scoffed at Donald Trump’s claim that he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, based on his relationship with Vladimir Putin.</p> 
  <p>After Trump claimed that he would get the war ended even before taking office, as president-elect, Harris shot back.</p> 
  <p>“I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jDJaa0tagKk">Harris said</a>. “You would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch”.</p>

  </figure> 
  <p>In the end, when Trump did meet Putin as president on Friday, seven months into his second term, their discussion of ending the war went so badly that even the planned working lunch with the leaders and their aides was canceled.</p> 
  <p>That meant that the Russians went home without tasting the filet mignon the president had planned to serve them, in sharp contrast to the last summit between the two presidents, in Helsinki in 2018, when lunch was served.</p> 
  <p>A photograph of that 2018 lunch, taken by the New York Times photographer Doug Mills, is also a reminder of how different the make-up of Trump’s delegation was then.</p>

  <p>In 2018, Trump sat down to lunch with Putin flanked by: John Kelly, his chief of staff; Fiona Hill, his Russia adviser; Mike Pompeo, his secretary of state; Jon Huntsman, his ambassador to Russia; and John Bolton, his national security adviser. Every one of those former aides subsequently left Trump’s inner circle and openly denounced him.</p> 
  <p>By contrast, Putin was joined at the 2018 lunch by: his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov; his foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov; and his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. All of them were at his side in Alaska on Friday.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump claims Putin told him 2020 election 'was rigged'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Donald Trump claimed in an interview with Sean Hannity on Friday that Vladimir Putin, the Russian autocrat who has jailed, exiled and killed political rivals who could challenge him in elections, told him at their summit meeting that the 2020 US presidential election “was rigged” through the widespread use of postal voting that year.</p> 
  <p>“Vladimir Putin said something, one of the most interesting things, he said, ‘Your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting,’” <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1956528296843170112">Trump said</a>. “He said, ‘No country has mail-in voting. It’s impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections.’”</p> 
  <p>“We talked about 2020, he said: ‘You won that election by so much,’” Trump added.</p> 
  <p>A short time later, after making the false claim that California’s system of sending ballots to voters opened the door to fraud, Trump said: “Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said ‘You can’t have an honest election with mail-in voting.’”</p> 
  <p>There is no evidence that voter fraud played any role in Trump’s loss in the 2020 election, but elections in Putin’s Russia are <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia_election_fraud_tactics_putin/24505805.html">notoriously dishonest</a>, with rampant cheating by the authorities documented by pro-democracy activists.</p> 
  <p>It is impossible to know if Putin did make these remarks, but Trump has a habit of putting his own words in the mouths of other people.</p> 
  <p>In the interview, he also claimed that Putin told him that the US was “dead” under his predecessor, Joe Biden, and was now “as hot as a pistol”.</p> 
  <p>Trump went on to repeat his claim that “the king of Saudi Arabia” told him the exact same thing in May, when he visited the country. But Trump did not meet the elderly king of Saudi Arabia during his visit.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Wars are very bad; I seem to have an ability to end them', Trump boasts after failure to broker Ukraine ceasefire</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In an interview with <strong>Sean Hannity</strong>, recorded in the room where he just failed to convince <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> to stop attacking Ukraine, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> just boasted that he has a special talent for ending wars.</p> 
  <p>“Wars are very bad, I seem to have an ability to end them,” Trump said.</p> 
  <p>The president was responding to a comment from Hannity, who praised Trump for playing a role in tamping down a series of largely dormant global conflicts in the past six months. Neither man mentioned that Trump had promised on the campaign trail that he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours if elected.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump boasts to Hannity that meeting with Putin was 'a 10'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Donald Trump’s post-summit interview with Sean Hannity is being broadcast now on Fox.</p> 
  <p>Trump began by repeating his claim that he “always had a great relationship with President Putin”, but cooperation between the United States and Russia was made impossible by the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which he refers to as a “hoax”.</p> 
  <p>He then said that he did have a chance to speak privately to Putin, after their brief, 12-minute news conference. Putin “spoke very sincerely”, Trump said about his desire to end the war in Ukraine. Trump did not mention that the war began with Putin’s decision to seize Ukrainian territory in 2014, after his ally was deposed as president of Ukraine in a popular uprising. It then intensified in 2022 when Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Asked by Hannity to rate the meeting on a scale of one to 10, Trump replied that it was “a 10” because it showed that the leaders of the two nuclear-armed nations could cooperate.</p> 
  <p>“It’s good when two big powers get along,” Trump said.</p> 
  <p>Hannity then pressed Trump to reveal what Putin told him about why he thought the war in Ukraine would not have started if Trump was president. Trump demurred, but said that he could say in his own words that the reason was that Biden was grossly incompetent.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>At the end of Donald Trump’s brief and somewhat defeated-sounding remarks after his meeting with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president extended an invitation to his US counterpart to hold the next round of talks in the Russian capital.</p> 
  <p>“Again, Mr President, I’d like to thank you very much, and we’ll speak to you very soon and probably see you again very soon,” Trump said. “Thank you very much, Vladimir.”</p> 
  <p>“Next time in Moscow,” Putin replied, chuckling.</p> 
  <p>“Oh, that’s an interesting one,” Trump said. “I’ll get a little heat on that one, but I, uh, I could see it possibly happening.”</p>

  <p>“But we’re going to go and find out. I’d like to see a ceasefire. I wouldn’t be thrilled if I didn’t get it, but everyone says, ‘You’re not going to get the ceasefire, it’ll take place on the second meeting’, but I’m not going to be happy with that.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">After summit ends with a whimper, Trump turns to Sean Hannity to make sense of it all</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The White House pool reporter tells us that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> “is currently doing a previously announced interview with <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> of Fox News”.</p> 
  <p>That interview, with an opinion host who is a strong supporter of the president and has campaigned for him, is scheduled to be broadcast on Hannity’s show in just over an hour.</p> 
  <p>The interview was billed by the network as an exclusive look behind the scenes at what was supposed to have been a meeting of historic importance, perhaps comparable to Richard Nixon’s 1972 visit to China to meet chairman <strong>Mao Zedong</strong>. At the very least, Trump said that he hoped to convince the Russian president, <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, to agree to an immediate ceasefire in his war on Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Now that Trump’s talks with Putin have failed to bring the war in Ukraine to an end, a conflict that he promised on the campaign trail he could end in 24 hours, his discussion with Hannity will no doubt be a good deal less celebratory.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Fox News calls it 'really stunning' that Putin spoke first on US soil</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Among those scrambling to make sense of the 12-minute news conference, at which no questions were taken before Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin departed, are Fox News producers and correspondents who had hyped this meeting between the presidents of the United States and Russia as a summit of historic proportions, and one at which they would have exclusive access.</p> 
  <p>The network planned to broadcast an exclusive preview of the summit, recorded with Trump en route to Alaska on Air Force One, as the talks went on, to be followed by a second exclusive interview with the president, conducted by Sean Hannity immediately after the talks, to be broadcast during his 9pm show on Fox.</p> 
  <p>Those carefully laid plans were thrown into chaos by the briefness of both the talk and the news conference.</p> 
  <p>Jacqui Heinrich, a Fox White House correspondent, just noted <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1956499546445627401">in a live report</a> from the conference room that what unfolded was very different from what Trump administration officials told reporters to expect. The idea, Heinrich said, was that there would be a news conference with the two leaders, and the opportunity to question them, if the talks went well, but if the talks did not go well, only Trump would appear and Putin would be sent packing.</p> 
  <p>“Neither of those things happened,” Heinrich noted. “And what was really stunning to me, as someone who has been in a lot of these press conferences, is there were a few things that were very unusual. You had Putin come out and address the press first. We are on US soil here.”</p> 
  <p>“The way that it felt in the room was not good,” Heinrich also said. “It did not seem like things went well. And it seemed like Putin came in and steamrolled, got right into what he wanted to say and got his photo next to the president and then left.”</p> 
  <p>As Heinrich tried to make sense of what had taken place, the corner of the screen on Fox promoted Trump’s interview with Hannity, which is still scheduled to air at 9pm ET.</p> 
  <p>Putin also dominated the joint appearance in terms of speaking time. While the Russian leader spoke for about 8 minutes and 30 seconds, the US president was done in just under 3 minutes and 30 seconds.</p>

  <p>That was quick. Donald Trump left more questions than answers as he fawned over Vladimir Putin but gave precious few details about their high-stakes summit.</p> 
  <p>“I believe we had a very productive meeting,” he said. “There were many, many points that we agreed on … There’s no deal until there’s a deal. I will call up Nato … I’ll of course call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today’s meeting … We really made some great progress.”</p> 
  <p>He added: “I’ve always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin – with Vladimir … We were interfered with by the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax.”</p> 
  <p>Trump warmly thanked Putin, who invited him to Moscow, and dozens of reporters shouted questions but in vain. The US president, who can typically never resist talking and talking, left the stage without answering any of them.</p>

  <p>Putin described Trump’s efforts on Ukraine as “precious” and claimed “everything that’s happening is a tragedy for us and terrible wound”.

  <p>As our colleague David Smith reported from Anchorage earlier, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> applauded <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, several times, when the two men met on a red carpet at the US airbase where they are now meeting in private with their top foreign policy advisers.</p> 
  <p>The Kremlin Press Office quickly distributed a photograph of the US president clapping for “his Russian counterpart” to news agencies.</p> 
  <p>The fact that the US president clapped for the Russian president and indicted war criminal, prompted the Russia-born cold war historian <strong>Sergey Radchenko</strong> to post <a href="https://x.com/DrRadchenko/status/1956433869290287257">a mind-blown emoji</a> on X. “I argued in my book how the Russians crave nothing quite as much as recognition by the U.S.” he added. “Well, there we have it. There it is.”</p> 
  <p>Trump’s three rounds of applause were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/0PXqAswHcwU?feature=shared&amp;t=1501">captured on a live stream</a> on the White House YouTube channel. But, a few minutes later, when the White House posted video of the greeting <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNYyhCEOwLz/?hl=en">on social media</a>, the clip was edited to begin a split-second after Trump finished his third round of applause for Putin.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Ukrainians mock Trump for rolling out the red carpet for Putin</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>As <strong>Donald Trump</strong> hosts <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> for talks in Alaska aimed at ending the Russian war on Ukraine, some Ukrainians watching from afar have noticed that the US literally rolled out a red carpet for the Russian president, who is an indicted war criminal charged with kidnapping Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied regions of their country.</p> 
  <p><strong>Mustafa Nayyem</strong>, a Ukrainian journalist turned politician, <a href="https://x.com/mefimus/status/1956458448142700722">posted</a> an image of US soldiers kneeling to secure the red carpet laid at the foot of Putin’s plane before the Russian president emerged with the caption: “Make Kneeling Great Again”.</p>

  <p><strong>Olga Rudenko</strong>, the editor of the Kyiv Independent, <a href="https://x.com/olya_rudenko/status/1956453393376874817">shared</a> the same image with the caption: “This is Putin’s new phone wallpaper. American soldiers kneeling under the big letters reading RUSSIA. To fix the red carpet. For a war criminal.” The Russian presidential jet is emblazoned with the word RUSSIA, written in Cyrillic letters.</p> 
  <p>A Ukrainian soldier, <strong>Oleksandr Solonko</strong>, <a href="https://x.com/solonko1648/status/1956450077184086144">wrote</a>: “I feel very sorry for the American military who were forced to roll out the red carpet for the greatest war criminal whose propaganda system has been smearing their country for many years.”</p> 
  <p>The symbolism did not go unnoticed in Russia.

 <h2 class="block-title">'On the day of negotiations, the Russians are killing as well,' Zelenskyy says from Kyiv</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>As <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> began their summit in Alaska centered on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine, the Ukrainian president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong>, delivered an update on the fighting in a social media address from Kyiv.</p> 
  <p>“On the day of negotiations, the Russians are killing as well. And that speaks volumes,” Zelenskyy wrote in <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1956418709783753153">a post</a> on X accompanying his video update.</p> 
  <p>He ran through a list of Russian targets. “Sumy – a Russian strike on the central market. Dnipro region – strikes on cities and enterprises. Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region, Donetsk region – deliberate Russian strikes. The war continues, and it is precisely because there is neither an order nor even a signal that Moscow is preparing to end this war,” Ukraine’s president said.</p> 
  <p>“Russia must end the war that it itself started and has been dragging out for years,” he added. “The killings must stop. A meeting of leaders is needed – at the very least, Ukraine, America, and the Russian side – and it is precisely in such a format that effective decisions are possible. Security guarantees are needed. Lasting peace is needed.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Emotions run high in frontline Ukrainian city over ceding land to Russia</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The city of Zaporizhzhia, an industrial hub in south-east Ukraine, is as good a place as any to grasp the stakes of freezing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine along its current frontlines, or of implementing a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/12/ukraine-russia-donbas-springboard-for-war-zelenskyy">“land swap for peace” deal</a> as envisioned by Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.</strong></p> 
  <p>Since Russian troops began rolling into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> in February 2022, Zaporizhzhia, with its broad avenues and Stalin-era apartment blocks, has been a 30-minute drive from the frontline. It has been under near-constant attack from missiles and drones. On Sunday, a Russian guided air bomb hit a bus station, wounding 24 people – just another day of suffering in a city that has known many of them.</p> 
  <p>Plenty of people here and in other Ukrainian towns close to the frontline are so weary of the sleepless nights and disrupted lives of the past years that they are ready for Kyiv to sign a peace deal, even an imperfect one, if it means the attacks will stop.</p> 
  <p>But many others have a very different opinion because they know first-hand what it means to give <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> control over Ukrainian territory: arrests, disappearances and the erasure of anything Ukrainian. As Moscow moves swiftly to Russify occupied territory, expelling or arresting active members of society and introducing new media outlets and school curricula heavy on propaganda, a few years of Russian control may make it almost impossible for Ukraine to regain these territories at a later date.</p> 
  <p>About one in five people living in Zaporizhzhia are internally displaced, from places even closer to the frontline or from occupied parts of Ukraine. They are living in Zaporizhzhia until they are able to go home.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump's pivotal meeting with Putin to begin shortly</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Welcome to our coverage of the US president’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. This will be the first meeting with the Kremlin leader of Trump’s second term in office –&nbsp;and his seventh in total.</p> 
  <p>I’m <strong>Shrai Popat</strong>, and I’ll be bringing you the latest – alongside my colleagues – from today’s event.</p> 
  <p>The summit is set to kick off in just over an hour (3pm ET), at <strong>Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson</strong>. To get you up to speed, this is where things stand at the moment:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Donald Trump has said, repeatedly, over the last few days that <strong>his chief aim</strong> of today’s meeting is to <strong>get a trilateral summit between Putin, Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong><strong> and himself on the books</strong>. In his own words, Trump wants this to happen “almost immediately”. He’s also convinced that he’ll be able to tell from the first few minutes of his meeting today whether it will be a success, and would be prepared to walk away “real fast” if he thinks it’s not going well, according to an interview with Fox News.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Crucially, the president has said he’s not in Alaska to negotiate on behalf of Ukraine, but instead with the goal of <strong>“getting Putin to the table”</strong>.</p></li> 
   <li><p>However, Trump has been less clear on what would constitute a success from his sit-down with the Kremlin leader today. Earlier, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115033738310216825">on Air Force One</a>, the president told reporters that he wants to see a ceasefire<strong> “rapidly</strong><strong>”</strong>.<strong> </strong>He added<strong>: “I don’t know if it’s going to be today, but I’m not going to be happy if it’s not today.”</strong></p></li> 
   <li><p>The president also repeated his stern words from earlier in the week that Russia could expect <strong>“severe consequences”</strong> if it fails to show willingness to end the war in Ukraine. “<strong>Economically severe.</strong> <strong>It will be very severe.</strong> <strong>I’m not doing this for my health, </strong><strong>OK, I don’t need it.</strong> <strong>I’d like to focus on our country, but I’m doing this to save a lot of lives,”</strong> the president said.</p></li> 
   <li><p>For Zelenskyy’s part, he said that Ukraine is<strong> “counting on America</strong>”.<em> </em>He’s been shut out of talks today, but reiterated his call for “an honest end to the war”, and said he hoped to see “a strong American position” during today’s talks in Alaska.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>When it comes to territory negotiations</strong>, Trump has said he’s not interested in deciding on those today without Ukraine present, and Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/12/ukraine-russia-donbas-springboard-for-war-zelenskyy">has said categorically</a> that Ukraine could not agree to a ceasefire deal which cedes territory, as Moscow could use this as a springboard to start a future war.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump confirmed to Zelenskyy that he’ll be <strong>calling him first</strong> after today’s meeting wraps, and he’s set to brief European leaders after that debrief.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Ahead of the today’s summit, the president posted on Truth Social that he had a <strong>“wonderful” call with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, </strong>saying “the purpose of the call was to thank him for the release of 16 prisoners”, with 1,300 under discussion. The Belarussian leader is the country’s only president since it adopted its current constitution. Lukashenko has described himself as Europe’s <strong>“last and only dictator”</strong>, and is a notable Russian ally.</p></li>
