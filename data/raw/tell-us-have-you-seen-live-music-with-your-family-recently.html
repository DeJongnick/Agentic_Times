<p>Ahead of Oasis’s reunion shows this year, you could certainly have expected to tick a lot of sights off your bingo card: bucket hats? Check. Wall-to-wall Adidas? Present and correct. Enough lager consumption to fill the Thames? Naturally. Perhaps less anticipated was the prevalence of families at these shows: multigenerational groups spanning from excited kids seeing their first big gigs to aunts, uncles and grandparents who could remember seeing the band back in the 90s.</p> <p>On the first night in Cardiff, one woman told us about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/04/one-for-the-bucket-hat-list-fans-flock-to-cardiff-for-oasiss-first-gig-in-16-years">attending a show in the city 31 years ago</a> while she was pregnant with her son, now bringing along his own young daughter; another boy was celebrating his 10th birthday there with his dad, who saw the band with his own father when he was a teenager. There have been similar scenes at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/pulp">Pulp</a>’s big shows: when they performed to a hometown crowd at Sheffield’s Tramlines last week, there was a noteworthy amount of kids word-perfect on their hits (including, entertainingly, Sorted for E’s and Wizz).</p> <p>So, we’d like to know: have you been on any mass family outings to see live music recently? Who did you see and how did it go? What memories did the shows stir up? What was the significance of seeing them all together? And what did the kids think?</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="b503efac-021c-406f-a1a2-5c624d905f42" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <h2><strong>This Community callout closed on 6 August 2025.</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>You can see the article that included respondents to this callout <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/04/the-families-who-go-gigging-together">here</a>.</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>You can contribute to open Community callouts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-community-team">here</a> or Share a story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/sep/02/guardianwitness-send-us-a-story">here</a>.</strong></p></li> </ul>
