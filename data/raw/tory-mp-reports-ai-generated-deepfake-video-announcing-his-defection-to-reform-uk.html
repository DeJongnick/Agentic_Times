<p>A Conservative MP has reported an “AI-generated deepfake” video of him announcing that he has joined Reform UK to the police, according to reports.</p> <p>George Freeman, the MP for Mid Norfolk, denounced the video and, in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1194072052540802&amp;set=pcb.1194072352540772">Facebook post</a>, called the deliberate spread of misinformation through AI-generated content a “concerning and dangerous development”.</p> <p>The video, which was widely circulated online, appeared to show the former Tory minister standing and speaking to the camera while saying he was switching allegiance and joining Nigel Farage’s party.</p> <p>It also showed the AI-generated Freeman saying the “time for half measures is over” and that the “Conservative party had lost its way”, while saying he was leaving the party.</p> <p>According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), the MP said he had “no intention of joining Reform or any other party. The LDRS also stated that Freeman reported the video to the police. </p> <p>Responding to the clip, Freeman said: “The video is a fabrication, created without my knowledge or consent, and uses my image and voice without permission. Regardless of my position as an MP, that should be an offence.”</p> <p>He added: “This sort of political disinformation has the potential to seriously distort, disrupt and corrupt our democracy.”</p>    <p>The MP then said he did not know whether the incident was a “politically motivated attack” or a “dangerous prank”. He also said that there has been a “huge increase in political disinformation, disruption and extremism” on both the left and right in recent months.</p> <p>Freeman said: “I have reported this matter to the relevant authorities, and I urge anyone who sees the video to report it immediately rather than share it further.”</p> <p>After getting elected in 2010, Freeman served in various ministerial positions in the previous Conservative government. Most recently, he was the minister for science, innovation and technology.</p> <p>Norfolk police have been contacted for comment.</p>
