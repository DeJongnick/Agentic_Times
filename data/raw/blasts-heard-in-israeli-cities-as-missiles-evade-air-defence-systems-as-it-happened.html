  <p>We’re moving our rolling coverage to a new page, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/15/at-least-eight-killed-in-iranian-strikes-on-israel-while-israeli-attacks-set-tehran-oil-depot-on-fire-live-updates">which you can find here</a>.</p> 
  <p>Here’s a look at where things stand:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>At least nine people are dead and more than 100 injured after Iran launched a barrage of missile strikes at Israel overnight</strong>, in retaliation for Israel’s Friday strikes which Israel said targeted Tehran’s nuclear program, hitting key sites including its defence ministry.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>An unknown number of missiles evaded Israel’s air defence system to hit Rehovot and Bat Yam in</strong> <strong>Tel Aviv</strong>, killing a 69-year-old woman, an 80-year-old woman, and two children including a 10-year-old boy, according to Israeli emergency services. More than 100 have been injured, and dozens still missing under rubble.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Earlier strikes on Saturday night killed at least four Palestinian citizens of Israel</strong> in the northern town of Tamra, including a woman and her two daughters aged 13 and 20.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Two oil facilities in Iran are on fire</strong> – one in Shahran and another in southern Tehran – after they were hit by Israeli strikes.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Israeli military said Iran still has an arsenal that can cause grave damage to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>. </strong>The Israeli military added that “at this hour, we are striking Iran”, and that “Iranian attacks are not behind us”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran has said 78 people were killed there on the first day of Israel’s attack</strong>, and scores more on the second, including 60 when a missile brought down a 14-storey apartment block in Tehran, where 29 of the dead were children.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Oman has announced the latest Iran-US nuclear talks that were scheduled to be held in Muscat have been cancelled. </strong>“The Iran US talks scheduled to be held in Muscat this Sunday will not now take place. But diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace,” Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, said in a post on X.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ali Shamkhani, Iran’s top adviser to its supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has died in the hospital a day after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> launched airstrikes across the country, Iranian media reports. </strong>Shamkhani had previously served as Iran’s top national security official for a decade and had represented <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> in the China-facilitated rapprochement talks with Saudi Arabia.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iranian authorities said that Israel’s airstrikes on Friday killed at least 30 military personnel in East Azerbaijan province, according to news agency ISNA. </strong>“Following the Zionist regime’s aggression against this province since Friday morning, 30 military personnel and one Red Crescent member have been martyred in defence of the Islamic homeland, and 55 people have been injured,” ISNA reported on Saturday, quoting East Azerbaijan provincial authorities.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that Israel’s strikes have set Iran’s nuclear programme back, possibly by years, and that heavier blows were yet to come.</strong> “We will hit every site and every target of the Ayatollahs’ regime and what they have felt so far is nothing compared with what they will be handed in the coming days,” Netanyahu said in a video message.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israel says it has hit Iranian nuclear sites, Iran fires at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>There’s quite a bit going on at the moment. We’re working through the information coming in, but it appears that not long after Israel’s air force said it hit Iranian nuclear project sites, including the ministry of defence, Iran returned fire, and explosions have been heard in both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Iranian state TV has announced a missile salvo against Israel.</p> 
  <p>In the last 20 minutes or so air raid sirens, explosions, and interceptions have been heard in both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, according to Reuters and Guardian reporters on the ground.</p> 
  <p>Videos are now emerging of buildings on fire in Tel Aviv following the strikes. We are working to verify footage. Some scenes are recognisable Tel Aviv streets.</p> 
  <p>Israeli media reports “multiple” impacts by Iranian missiles. Israeli police so far have reported rockets and shrapnel falling in Tel Aviv causing damage but no injuries.</p> 
  <p>Two oil facilities in Iran are on fire – one in Shahran and another in southern Tehran – after they were hit by Israeli strikes.</p> 
  <p>In a statement Iran’s revolutionary guard said its operations “will continue to be more ferocious and widespread if the atrocities and attacks continue”.</p> 
  <p>Israel sounded an alarm earlier in northern Israel over “hostile aircraft infiltration”.</p>

  <p><strong>In Cyprus, the European Union’s nearest member state to the Middle East, authorities have activated an emergency evacuation plan that, as in previous crises, has seen the strategic island become a hub for third world nationals fleeing conflict in the region.</strong></p> 
  <p>With all eyes on the island’s British sovereign base areas – a legacy of colonial rule – the Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides, has been keen to underscore the humanitarian role the country has to play.</p> 
  <p>“The Republic of Cyprus, I repeat, is not involved in any way in this conflict,” he earlier said today. “Our role is purely humanitarian, and we are ready, we have activated the ‘Estia plan’, in case the need arises to play our role, which is purely humanitarian,” he told reporters referring to the evacuation scheme.</p> 
  <p>Christodoulides said Cyprus’s national security council had been informed by the UK that none of the military installations – which include a Royal Air Force (RAF) base at Akrotiri and an intelligence-gathering facility at Dhekelia in the south of the island – had been used since the crisis erupted early on Friday with Israeli strikes on Iran. Tehran has vowed it will target UK bases and ships – and assets belonging to the US and France – if either of the countries attempts to obstruct the missile and drone attacks Iran has launched in retaliation.</p> 
  <p>In Limassol, a popular port town in the south of Cyprus, Iranian missiles aimed at Israel were clearly visible late on Friday. The local government has informed the public that defense shelters are ready, should the need arise, with the interior ministry launching a mobile app, available in Greek and English, informing people of shelter locations.</p>

  <p>In the hours after Israel attacked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>, food shipments and distribution in Gaza stopped and a French-Saudi summit meant to pave the way for wider recognition of a Palestinian state was postponed indefinitely.</p> 
  <p>International pressure over starvation and civilian killings in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> had apparently dissipated in little more than the time it took for the smoke of the first missile strikes to clear over Tehran.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s military moved fast to declare Iran its top priority, with the battle for Gaza relegated to second place. That shift was echoed in foreign ministries and newsrooms around the world.</p> 
  <p>“The fact that Israel attacked Iran doesn’t mean [the war in] Gaza ended. Today we had dozens of people killed, the only difference is this will have far less attention than yesterday,” said Xavier Abu Eid, a political scientist and former adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p> 
  <p>“Israel’s message [with these attacks] is that there is no political solution for anything in the region. By striking Iran they want to sabotage the US-Iran negotiations as well as the international wave of support for concrete measures on Palestine.”</p> 
  <p>The decision by Israel’s prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, to take out the security threat posed by Iran’s nuclear programme had also defanged a significant diplomatic and economic threat to his government.</p> 
  <p>Some of Israel’s closest allies in Europe had become increasingly outspoken about both the impact of the war in Gaza on civilians, and escalating violence by Jewish settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.</p> 
  <p>Even historically strong alliances with countries such as the Netherlands and Germany had been faltering in the face of an 11-week siege of Gaza, UN warnings of a looming famine and repeated mass killings of hungry crowds trying to reach food distribution sites.</p>

  <p>Donald Trump has said the US will help defend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, and American officials have been quoted in news reports saying that US forces have already helped shoot down Iranian drones and missiles as they approached Israel. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, also said on Friday that his country would help defend Israel against Iranian reprisals.</p> 
  <p>The UK government has said its forces <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/uk-government-confirms-no-military-support-given-for-israels-attack-on-iran">had not provided any military assistance</a> to Israel as the prime minister, Keir Starmer, has emphasised the need for de-escalation.</p> 
  <p>Tehran is seeking to deter western support for Israel’s defence at a time most of the missiles and drones it fires at Israel are being intercepted before they reach their targets. However, following through on the threat, delivered on Saturday through state media, would be an enormous gamble for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>, drawing western forces into the conflict when it is already reeling under the force of sustained Israeli bombing.</p> 
  <p>Speaking at a session of the UN security council on Friday, US diplomat McCoy Pitt warned: “No government proxy or independent actor should target American citizens, American bases or other American infrastructure in the region. The consequences for Iran would be dire.”</p>

  <p>Earlier, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “The UK did not participate in Israel’s strikes overnight,” and they indicated that the RAF had also not taken part in any military action to knock out Iranian drones attacking Israel in a counterattack launched by Tehran in the morning.</p>

  <p>Speaking to Iranian media the foreign ministry spokesperson <strong>Esmaeil Baghaee</strong> said: “It is still unclear what decision we will make in this regard on Sunday.” He added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The other side did something that practically rendered negotiations and dialogue meaningless.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He emphasised that it is unthinkable for the Islamic Republic of Iran that “the Zionist regime [Israel]” would have committed such a war in the region without the coordination or conscious green light of the US.</p> 
  <p>It had been expected that Iran would feel compelled immediately to end all talks, so the Iranian indecision is a surprise, possibly reflecting diplomatic pressure on the country to find a way out of the crisis.</p> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> had urged Iran to attend the talks – the sixth set of talks that are being brokered by <strong>Oman</strong>. The meeting was due to be the first in which both sides would have tabled written proposals.</p> 
  <p>The sticking point for both sides is whether Iran could retain the right to enrich uranium at much lower levels than now. Iran is content for this to happen subject to independent monitoring, but only on the condition that US sanctions are lifted.</p> 
  <p>The US is insisting that Iran lose its right to enrich since there is no sure way of preventing Iran acquiring a nuclear bomb if it continues to enrich domestically. The US believes that if Iran is to have a civil nuclear programme it should import uranium from third countries. Iran says it is a sovereign right to enrich.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Iran</strong> said the dialogue with the <strong>US</strong> over <strong>Tehran’s nuclear programme</strong> is “meaningless” but said it is yet to decide on whether to attend planned talks on Sunday, reports Reuters.</p> 
  <p>“The other side [the US] acted in a way that makes dialogue meaningless. You cannot claim to negotiate and at the same time divide work by allowing the Zionist regime [Israel] to target Iran’s territory,” state media on Saturday quoted foreign ministry spokesperson <strong>Esmaeil Baghaei</strong> as saying. “It is still unclear what decision we will make on Sunday in this regard,” Baghaei was quoted as saying.</p> 
  <p>He said Israel “succeeded in influencing” the diplomatic process and the <strong>Israeli</strong> attack would not have happened without <strong>Washington</strong>’s permission, accusing Washington of supporting the attack.</p> 
  <p>Iran earlier accused the US of being complicit in Israel’s attacks, but Washington denied the allegation and told <strong>Tehran</strong> at the <strong>UN security council</strong> that it would be “wise” to negotiate over its nuclear programme.</p> 
  <p>The sixth round of <strong>US-Iran nuclear talks</strong> was to be held on Sunday in <strong>Muscat</strong>, but it was unclear whether it would go ahead after the Israeli strikes.</p> 
  <p>Iran denies that its uranium enrichment programme is for anything other than civilian purposes, rejecting Israeli allegations that it is secretly developing nuclear weapons.</p> 
  <p><strong>US</strong> president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> told Reuters that he and his team had known the Israeli attacks were coming but they still saw room for an accord.</p>

  <p><strong>France</strong> and <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> have postponed next weeks <strong>UN</strong> conference in <strong>New York</strong> on a two state solution.

  <p>There was a concern that the sudden <strong>Iran</strong> crisis meant senior Arab ministers would not have felt able to leave the region to fly to New York. Many <strong>Gulf states</strong> are trying to ensure they do not become drawn into the <strong>Iran-Israel</strong> conflict. </p>

  <p>A missile from the first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/israel-says-attack-on-iran-just-the-beginning">Iranian salvo fired at Tel Aviv</a> had landed a couple of blocks away, killing at least one person, injuring at least 16 others and damaging hundreds of shops and homes in this quiet residential area.<br><br>The 37-year-old was sanguine about her own losses, and backed the government decision to attack <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> even though it had so quickly cost her family their home.</p> 
  <p>“I support it completely,” she said as her older daughter stroked their chihuahua. “This is nothing compared to what they will be able to do if they get their hand on the A-bomb [nuclear weapons]. We can’t afford for the Iranians to get them.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Earlier, Al Jazeera journalist Anas Al-Sharif reported that dozens of civilians in Gaza were killed or wounded early on Saturday after they were attacked by Israeli forces as they gathered to wait for aid north of the Nuseirat refugee camp.</p> 
  <p>The Guardian has not been able to confirm the details of this report. Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort.  A complete internet blackout in the Gaza Strip since Thursday has made reporting even more challenging.</p> 
  <p>There have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/12/more-mass-casualties-gaza-food-points-ghf-staff-killed">repeated deadly attacks</a> on Palestinians queuing for food aid and the GHF scheme of distributing food from a restricted number of heavily militarised sites has been strongly criticised. For months, humanitarian experts have warned that Gaza is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/30/gaza-hungriest-place-earth-all-people-risk-famine-un">on the brink of famine</a>.</p> 
  <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said in a statement it will not distribute food aid on Saturday. It did not provide an explanation, but said food assistance would resume on Sunday.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Opening summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East, where Iran has launched a wave of retaliatory attacks after Israel killed scores of people and injured hundreds in a surprise attack on Friday morning that it claimed was aimed at preventing its arch enemy from developing a nuclear weapon.</p> 
  <p>Explosions were heard over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv early on Saturday. Two people were reported to have been killed, one in Tel Aviv in an attack on Friday night and one in central Israel on Saturday morning. In Iran, fresh explosions were reported at an airport in Tehran that houses an air force base, and across the Hakimiyeh and Tehranpars neighbourhoods in the east of the capital.</p> 
  <p>The Israeli military said its air defence systems were operating. “In the last hour, dozens of missiles have been launched at the state of Israel from Iran, some of which were intercepted,” the Israeli military said.</p> 
  <p>Rescue teams were working at a number of locations across the country where fallen projectiles were reported, it said.</p> 
  <p>In Iran, several explosions were heard in the capital, Tehran, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. The Fars news agency said two projectiles hit Tehran’s Mehrabad airport, and Iranian media said flames were reported there. Close to key Iranian leadership sites, the airport hosts an air force base with fighter jets and transport aircraft.</p> 
  <p>Israeli media said a suspected missile came down in Tel Aviv, and a loud boom was reported in Jerusalem.</p> 
  <p>In other developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran’s envoy to the UN security council, Amir Saeid Iravani, said 78 people including senior officials had been killed in the Israeli attacks on Friday, and that more than 320 were injured, most of them civilians</strong>. He said the US was complicit in the attacks and accused Israel of seeking “to kill diplomacy, to sabotage negotiations and to drag the region into wider conflict”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The US role in the attack <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/trump-iran-israel-attacks-response">remained murky</a> with President Donald Trump giving conflicting accounts as to his approval and foreknowledge</strong>. In the run-up to the Israeli 200-plane attack, Trump had publicly urged Israel to give diplomacy more of a chance, before US-Iranian talks that were planned for Sunday. But on Friday, the US president insisted he had been well informed of Israel’s plans and described the Israeli attack as “excellent”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran launched a fresh wave of attacks on Israel early on Saturday, state media said, after Israel’s military reported it detected inbound missiles from Iran</strong>. “New round of Honest Promise 3 attacks,” state television reported, referring to the name of the Iranian military operation against Israel.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel’s ambulance service said 34 people were injured on Friday night in the Tel Aviv area, most with minor injuries. Police later said one person had died</strong>. On Saturday Israeli media quoted emergency services as saying one person had been killed and 19 injured by a direct Iranian strike on an area in central Israel.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A top-level UN conference on a two-state solution for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> and the Palestinians scheduled for next week has been postponed, French president Emmanuel Macron said on Friday.</strong> France and Saudi Arabia had been due to co-chair the conference hosted by the UN general assembly in New York on 17-20 June, and Macron had been among leaders scheduled to attend.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Dozens of Palestinians were killed and injured after Israeli forces opened fire on people waiting to receive aid near a checkpoint north of Nuseirat, Al Jazeera reporter Anas al-Sharif and Drop Site News reported, in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/11/israeli-forces-kill-at-least-60-palestinians-seeking-food-aid-in-gaza-health-officials-say">latest such massacre</a>. More Palestinians were killed when Israeli gunboats targets the tents of displaced people on a beach north-west of Gaza City, al-Sharif reported</strong>. It was impossible to independently verify the reports as Israel has barred foreign journalists from entering the territory. It has also cut off internet to Gaza since Thursday.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel closed all checkpoints to the Israeli-occupied West Bank as the country attacked Iran, a military official said Friday</strong>. The move sealed off entry and exit to the territory, meaning that Palestinians could not leave without special coordination.</p></li>
