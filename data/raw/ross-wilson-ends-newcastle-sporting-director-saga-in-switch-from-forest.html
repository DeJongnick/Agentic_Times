<p>Ross Wilson has filled the vacant sporting director role at Newcastle, drawing to a close one of English football’s longest-running pursuits.</p> <p>Talks about Wilson’s departure from Nottingham Forest are completed, with Newcastle finalising an undisclosed compensation deal with Forest. One of Wilson’s first tasks in his new role role will be attempting to persuade Sandro Tonali to sign a new contract, extending the Italy midfielder’s deal beyond 2028.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/10/flag-alert-gary-neville-orwell-english-patriot">Flag alert! Gary Neville may not be Orwell but he is a very English type of patriot | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wilson said on Saturday he was delighted to join Newcastle, adding: “This is such a special club. I fully understand the passion, ambition and expectations of our incredible supporters as well as the ambition and desire of our ownership to keeping developing and building an even stronger Newcastle United.</p> <p>“My conversations with the ownership have been extremely positive and I’ve also been in regular contact with both Eddie Howe and David Hopkinson [the new chief executive]. The trust, cohesion and alignment we’re building already feels strong.</p> <p>“I’m excited to work with everyone across the different areas within our football department from the first team to the women’s team and the academy. There’s already excellent work being done but my aim is to build on that.”</p> <p>Howe has advocated for Wilson’s appointment since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/02/newcastle-united-paul-mitchell-eddie-howe-pif-saudi-arabia">Paul Mitchell stood down</a> as Newcastle’s sporting director in June. </p> <p>Prising Ross – who was part of the visiting contingent as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/05/newcastle-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report">Newcastle beat Ange Postecoglou’s side</a> at St James’ Park last Sunday – out of the City Ground has proved slow and complicated, particularly as Forest’s owner, Evangelos Marinakis was reluctant to lose the highly regarded 41-year-old. Wilson may have feared the prospect of Edu treading on his toes after Marinakis hired Arsenal’s former sporting director as Forest’s global head of football this summer.</p> <p>After arriving in the East Midlands from Glasgow, where he had previously shone in an administrative role at Rangers, Wilson played a big part in shaping Forest’s recruitment strategy, while supervising upgrades of the club’s academy, women’s team, medical department and general infrastructure. It did not go unnoticed that Wilson’s influence helped persuade key signings, including Elliot Anderson, Anthony Elanga, Nikola Milenkovic and Callum Hudson-Odoi, to join Forest.</p>    <p>Elanga was sold to Newcastle for £55m this summer, the deal representing a healthy profit on a player who cost Forest a relatively modest £13.5m when he joined from Manchester United in July 2023. Newcastle have traditionally been poor sellers and it is hoped Wilson will improve this aspect of their recruitment operation.</p> <p>He will become Newcastle’s third sporting director in two years and there is confidence at the club that he will remain in situ for considerably longer than his two immediate predecessors. While Mitchell never really bonded with Howe, Dan Ashworth’s head was turned by an offer from Manchester United.</p> <p>Wilson is expected to be heavily involved with the women’s team and plans for a new training ground. The idea is that he will enjoy a collaborative relationship with Howe that involves Newcastle’s manager having a final say on all signings and outgoings. Howe’s nephew, Andy Howe, is expected to continue to in a senior recruitment role.</p> <p>Howe’s enthusiasm at Wilson’s appointment is shared by Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian owners and the Canadian Hopkinson.</p>
