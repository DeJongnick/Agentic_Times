<p>Zachary Rolfe, the police officer who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/11/zachary-rolfe-found-not-guilty-of-over-kumanjayi-walker-fatal-shooting">acquitted of murder in 2022</a> for the shooting death of Kumanjayi Walker, has been offering his services on the speaking circuit, where he could be booked for $5,001-$10,000 to deliver talks on “leadership, crisis management and ethical decision-making”.</p> <p>Rolfe is named as a speaker at an event for first responders in Parramatta in Sydney on Saturday called Frontline Summit Purpose in Service and Beyond alongside other former first responders.</p> <p>Rolfe posted about the event online, saying: “It will be a solid day with the right people, pushing the culture in the right direction.”</p> <p>A protest calling for the end to black deaths in custody is planned in Parramatta Square on the day of the event, with the advertisement referencing Rolfe’s presence at the event.</p> <p>The organiser of the Frontline Summit has been contacted for comment.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Rolfe, a former soldier and police officer who now runs a private investigations company, was listed as a speaker on the website of Platinum Speakers, which has nearly 2,000 speakers advertised.</p> <p>His speaker profile appeared to have been removed from the Platinum Speakers website after the company was contacted by Guardian Australia on Monday afternoon. Platinum Speakers said they had never booked a speaking gig for Rolfe, adding: “We do not work with him.” </p> <p>Before it was taken down,<strong> </strong>Rolfe’s profile on the site described him as “Soldier Policeman Hero” and said that in his talks he “speaks from the heart and is backed with experiences very few will endure. He is decorated for bravery and stands tall on the principles of fair play and ethical behaviour.”</p> <p>Walker’s death was referenced in Rolfe’s speaker biography, which said: “Zach’s career took a dramatic turn following a fatal shooting during an arrest, leading to his arrest and a high-profile murder trial.</p> <p>“Throughout this gruelling process, he exhibited remarkable resilience, navigating legal complexities with the same focus and determination that characterised his military and policing careers. Acquitted in a landmark decision, Zach’s experience offers profound insights into the intersection of law enforcement, justice and media perception.</p> <p>“Zach Rolfe’s journey from soldier to police officer, through a high-profile trial, and on to a new career as a private investigator, underscores his enduring commitment to service, bravery and the pursuit of justice.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/16/more-than-30-years-after-the-royal-commission-why-are-indigenous-australians-still-dying-in-custody">More than 30 years after the royal commission, why are Indigenous Australians still dying in custody? | Thalia Anthony and Eddie Cubillo for the Conversation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rolfe was found not guilty of murder in relation to the shooting death of Walker in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs. He was also cleared of the alternative charges of manslaughter and engaging in a violent act causing death.</p> <p>The verdict came after an almost five-week trial in the supreme court in Darwin, which heard Rolfe shot Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, while trying to arrest him.</p> <p>Rolfe defended the charges on the grounds he feared for the life of his partner Adam Eberl and was acting in good faith and “the reasonable performance of his duties”.</p> <p>A coronial inquest into Walker’s death was due to return its findings earlier this month, but has been delayed at the request of the local community, following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/28/yuendumu-grief-young-aboriginal-man-dies-in-police-custody-nt">the death of Kumanjayi White in Alice Springs in May</a>.
