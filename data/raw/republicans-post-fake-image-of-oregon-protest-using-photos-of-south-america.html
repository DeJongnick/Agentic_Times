<p>Before a federal judge blocked Donald Trump from putting members of California’s national guard on the streets of Portland, Oregon, late on Sunday, the state’s Republican party welcomed the planned deployment in celebratory posts on social media.</p> <p>“President Trump on Sunday deployed 300 California National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon after a judge ruled that the Oregon National Guard could not be deployed to keep federal facilities and personnel in Portland safe,” Oregon Republicans wrote on their official <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oregonrepublicanparty/posts/pfbid022PFtHyDvS2uPkTSKKXb12T1ptcU3AQAAN7J7nmXVciQN8HCze1PTTDNaKM1NELktl">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPcU1xwAbcv/?hl=en">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Oregon_GOP/status/1974950362592485821">X</a> accounts.</p> <p>On all three platforms, the statement was illustrated with an image that seemed designed to support Trump’s false claim that protests against immigration sweeps in Portland are so out of control that the city is “burning to the ground”. On one side of the image, a line of police officers held riot shields; on the other, a crowd of young men held up flares that lit up a night sky filled with red smoke.</p>    <p>On closer inspection, however, it turned out that the image was not a photograph of a real event in Portland, but instead a fabrication created by combining two photographs of scenes that<strong> </strong>unfolded in South America nearly a decade apart.</p> <p>The image of the police officers comes from a photo of “South American riot police” that was <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/south-american-riot-police-royalty-free-image/157402471">uploaded to the Getty Images archive</a> in 2008. A clear visual clue that the photograph was not taken in Portland was that the first officer’s shield is marked “Policia”, the Spanish or Portuguese word for police.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="57a06c2a74121ce313097803cc4966779b6864f0"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/57a06c2a74121ce313097803cc4966779b6864f0/0_0_2748_1789/1000.jpg" alt="An image of police standing with riot shields placed in front of them.

It was taken by a Brazilian photographer in 2017.</p>    <p>When a Guardian reporter pointed out on social media that the image was not a genuine photograph of the generally small and tame protests outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland, the Oregon Republican Party’s X account replied: “We’re not reporters, just bad memers.”</p>
