<h1>‘Two pairs aren’t enough’: the things our Filter experts swear by when they’re off duty </h1>

<p>Our expert Filter writers have spent the past year at your service: putting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/06/best-mattress">mattresses</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/21/best-coffee-machines">coffee machines</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/11/best-secateurs-bypass-uk">secateurs</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/04/best-low-alcohol-non-alcoholic-drinks">low-alcohol drinks</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/oct/07/best-hair-masks-uk">hair masks</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/17/sleep-remedies-aids-tested">sleep aids</a> and more through their paces.</p> <p>Yet we’re curious (read: nosy) types here and wanted to know what they get up to when they’re off duty, relaxing, exercising, cooking and parenting. So, we asked them for their recommendations for the best thing(s) they’ve bought this year. A kids’ toy that placates a two-year-old, tracksuit bottoms so good our writer owns three pairs, and the perfect hummus: these 49 products are all tried, loved and bought on repeat.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best things Filter writers bought this year</h2> <p>***</p> <h2>Just my type</h2>    <p><strong>Antique typewriter</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/bn_2317737 " > View at eBay </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.etsy.com/market/antique_typewriter" > View at Etsy </a>  <p>For her 18th birthday, I bought my daughter a working, vintage typewriter for £5 at a jumble sale. Every young person who sees it wants one.<strong> </strong>They seem to like old things, though what they see as old doesn’t seem old to me. They love early digital cameras, for example, and I grew up on film. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/caramel-quin">Caramel Quin</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Cosy, cooking, and coffee</h2>    <p><strong>Alaskan </strong><strong>Husky faux fur throw</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/dreamland-alaskan-husky-faux-fur-throw/p5111249" > £79.99 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dreamlanduk.co.uk/products/relaxwell-deluxe-alaskan-husky-faux-fur-heated-throw" > £79.99 at Dreamland </a>  <p>Last winter, I got myself a heated throw. As I work in an office in the garden, the house heating isn’t on during the day so lunchtimes are brrr. This made a huge difference. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachel-ogden">Rachel Ogden</a></strong></p> <p><em><strong>For more, see our guide to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/dec/27/best-electric-blankets-heated-throws">the best heated throws and electric blankets</a></strong></em></p>    <p><strong>Air fryer oil spray</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.asda.com/groceries/product/9228292" > £2.74 at Asda </a>  <p>I also swear by this oil spray for air frying chips and veggies – oil distributes evenly and the blend does a much better job than the spoonful of rapeseed I was using. <strong>RO</strong></p>    <p><strong>Grind house blend coffee</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/grind-house-blend-whole-bean-coffee/450226-803280-803281" > £6.25 for 200g at Waitrose </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://grind.co.uk/products/1kg-bag-of-grind-coffee-beans-new" > £29.95 for 1kg at Grind </a>    <p><strong>Tin of Grind coffee</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.ocado.com/products/grind-house-blend-ground-coffee-tin/484574011" > £9 at Ocado </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://grind.co.uk/products/beanandground" > £9.95 at Grind </a>  <p>Everyone who knows me is aware that I am powered by coffee. Grind’s house blend is really tasty, plus I have a mild addiction to its tins, which are brilliant for keeping my decaf ground coffee fresh.<strong> RO</strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Curls and swirls, lashes and locks</h2>    <p><strong>Bed Head Curls Rock Amplifier, 100ml</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.superdrug.com/hair/curl-cream/bed-head-curls-rock-amplifier-cream-100ml/p/855300" > £10 at Superdrug </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bed-Head-TIGI-Curls-Amplifier/dp/B0F743FF8Y" > £9.99 at Amazon </a>    <p><strong>Benefit Bad Gal mascara</strong><strong>, 8.5g</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/p/benefit-badgal-bang-volumizing-mascara-pitch-black-8.5g/11647420/" > £21.60 at Lookfantastic </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/benefit-badgal-bang-volumizing-mascara-pitch-black-8.5g/11647420/" > £27 at Cult Beauty </a>  <p>Bed Head Curls Rock Amplifier: I have curly hair and this is the only product that doesn’t frizz my hair. And Benefit Bad Gal mascara the only one to offer volume without clumps. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/olivia-petter">Olivia Petter</a></strong></p> <p><em><strong>For more, see our guide to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/23/best-mascara-uk">the best mascara</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Game on!</h2>    <p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/nintendo-switch-2-000000000010015152" > £395.99 at Nintendo </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7624867" > £395.99 at Argos </a>  <p>Our best family buy this year has been the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s a great console for party games, and plays existing Switch games (many of which offer free patches to take advantage of the Switch 2’s improved graphics), as well as new titles. We’ve already racked up hundreds of hours of gameplay, most of it communal, which is (usually) good for family harmony. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lise-smith">Lise Smith</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Pan-orama</h2>    <p><strong>Ninja Zerostick two-pan set</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://ninjakitchen.co.uk/product/ninja-zerostick-stackable-2-piece-frying-pan-set-20cm-26cm-c52000uk-zidC52000UK" > £59.99 at Ninja </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/1120020" > £89.99 at Argos </a>  <p>It may sound sad, but the best thing I have bought this year is a set of non-stick frying pans from Ninja. They’ve revolutionised pancakes on a Saturday morning – no more scrubbing off burnt bits. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/leon-poultney">Leon Poultney</a></strong></p> <p><em><strong>For more, see our guide to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/05/best-frying-pans-uk">the best frying pans</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Fabled tables on the cheap</h2>    <p>Charity shops, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=vintage+furniture&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1311">eBay</a> and Facebook Marketplace are treasure troves for vintage furniture, if you keep an open mind and are prepared to scroll. I found a beautiful Georgian demi-lune side table on the latter for £25. Antique brown furniture can be surprisingly cheap as it’s largely out of fashion, but it’s beautifully made and can bring depth to a room. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-jacobs">Kate Jacobs</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Senses working overtime </h2>    <p><strong>Cosrx snail serum, 100ml</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/cosrx-advanced-snail-radiance-dual-essence" > £23.90 at Sephora </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.boots.com/cosrx-advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence-gel-100ml-10280721" > £24.99 at Boots </a>  <p>Snail serum for my skin. I know, I know, disgusting idea, but I swear it works. The brand says it’s ethically harvested … <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jesscartnermorley">Jess Cartner-Morley</a></strong></p>    <p><strong>Paper diary</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.smythson.com/uk/cerulean-2026-panama-weekly-diary-with-pencil-1204638.html" > £100 at Smythson </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/product/smythson-panama-2026-weekly-with-pencil-leather-diary_R04536102/" > £100 at Selfridges </a>  <p>I’m very old-school: I still have a paper diary. And it has to be Smythson. Luxury is an overused word, but to me real luxury isn’t fancy pants logos but having top-class versions of the things you handle many times a day. I’ve already ordered my 2026 handbag-sized Panama, with a gold pencil. Every year I spend hours agonising over the colour – this time I’ve gone with cerulean. <strong>JCM</strong></p>    <p><strong>Embroidered cushions</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.laredoute.co.uk/ppdp/prod-351220875.aspx" > £19 at La Redoute </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.debenhams.com/product/furn-les-fruites-embroidered-ruffle-cushion_p-48b15527-d828-4b7a-8a40-fdfa09ca7cb4" > £20 at Debenhams </a>  <p>The best things I’ve bought for my home this year are pairs of rectangular pillows. They instantly make a double bed look pleasingly hotel-ish. Inexpensive and charming, and a tiny thing that gives me a sense of control in a world full of chaos. <strong>JCM</strong></p>    <p><strong>Flying Goose sriracha mayo sauce, 455ml</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/flying-goose-brand-sriracha-mayo-sauce-455ml" > £3.60 at Saisnbury’s </a>  <p>And the best thing I’ve bought for my kitchen is this Flying Goose sriracha mayo. Unbelievably delicious on everything from eggs to stir-fries. I am addicted. <strong>JCM</strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Jeans genie</h2>    <p>Clothes<strong> </strong>on <a href="https://www.vinted.co.uk/">Vinted</a>. I got some great wide-leg Levi’s that I now wear all the time. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sophia-longhi">Sophia Longhi</a></strong> </p> <p>***</p> <h2>Definitely my bag, baby</h2>    <p><strong>Herd tote</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://herdbags.com/collections/all/products/herd-tote-bag-the-dolce-vita-medium" > £20 at Herd </a>  <p>I’ve just bought another Herd medium tote bag. They’re perfect for the beach, the kids’ swimming lessons and for taking Vinted parcels to the lockers. Roomy, durable (I’ve had my older one for five years and it still looks great), fun and sustainable – what’s not to love? <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zo--phillimore">Zoë Phillimore</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Listen up, right</h2>    <p><strong>Shokz OpenFit 2+</strong> <strong>headphones</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://uk.shokz.com/products/openfit2-series" > £179 at Shokz </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/shokz-openfit-2-bluetooth-true-wireless-open-ear-headphones/black/p113753491" > £179 at John Lewis </a>  <p>I got the Shokz OpenFit 2+ headphones with running in mind. They loop over the top of the ear, providing a secure, comfortable fit, while the earphones sit over the ear canal rather than pushing in like a pair of earbuds. This makes them naturally hear-through, great for runners who need to safely negotiate areas with busy traffic. The only downside is that you’ll need to play audio at a high volume. But these headphones are excellent at bringing out the detail in mid-range frequencies, from podcasts to the electronic percussion on Silent Shout by the Knife. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pete-wise">Pete Wise</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Outdoor essentials and toddler toys</h2>    <p><strong>Klm Nal shorts</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.flannels.com/klattermusen-klm-nal-ultramid-walking-shorts-mens-440185" > £119 at Flannels </a>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.houseoffraser.co.uk/brand/klattermusen/klm-nal-ultramid-walking-shorts-mens-440185" > £119 at Frasers </a>  <p>I’m incredibly picky when it comes to clothes. This year I tried the Klm Nal shorts from lesser-known Swedish outdoor brand Klättermusen, and they’re perfect – light, stretchy, comfortable and surprisingly durable for such a thin fabric. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paddy-maddison">Paddy Maddison</a></strong></p>    <p><strong>Arc’teryx </strong><strong>Hoody</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/p/arc-teryx-mens-atom-hooded-jacket-B12ACB0360.html" > £210 at Cotswold Outdoor </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://arcteryx.com/gb/en/shop/mens/atom-hoody-9556" > £260 at Arc’teryx </a>  <p>This Arc’teryx Atom Hoody is comfortable in a broad range of temperatures and perfect for layering. The brand offers an in-house repair and re-proofing/washing service for those lucky enough to live near a store. <strong>PM</strong></p>    <p><strong>Busy board</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1865041654/personalised-name-montessori-busy-board" > £15.99 at Etsy </a>  <p>A wooden Montessori “busy board” for my two-year-old son. It has various coloured LED lights, switches, buttons, keys, knobs. I whip it out when we’re travelling or if he’s about to go into meltdown mode, and nine times out of 10 it does the trick. <strong>PM</strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Leak prevention</h2>    <p><strong>Sebson water alarms</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07DCSNYLZ" > £15.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>Towards the end of last year, we found out that the cold tap that feeds our washing machine had been leaking. To cut a long story short, it ended up as an insurance job, with a rented <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/oct/21/best-dehumidifiers-tested-uk">dehumidifier</a>, redecoration and new flooring in two rooms. So, I’ve invested in a handful of water alarms: small plastic boxes with a pair of electrical sensors in the base. If the sensors are connected by moisture on the floor, they let off a piercing shriek. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andy-shaw">Andy Shaw</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Sole searching</h2>    <p><strong>JLab Go Pop headphones</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.jlab.com/en-gb/products/go-pop-anc-true-wireless-earbuds-black" > £29.99 at JLab </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/JLab-Cancelling-Headphones-Sweat-Resistant-Microphone-Black/dp/B0DD2VL3MX" > £29.99 at Amazon </a>      <p><strong>Garmin Forerunner 970 smartwatch</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/p/garmin-forerunner-970-gps-smartwatch-B3BG3B0054.html" > £629.99 at Cotswold Outdoor </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.millets.co.uk/19695869/garmin-forerunner-970-gps-watch-19695869/6206140" > £630 at Millets </a>      <p><strong>Saucony Men’s Endorphin Speed 5</strong> <strong>running shoes</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.saucony.com/UK/en_GB/endorphin-speed-5/60307M.html" > Men’s, £180 at Saucony </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.sportsdirect.com/saucony-endorphin-speed-5-shoes-womens-210393" > Women’s, £145 at Sports Direct </a>  <p>The JLab Go Pop ANC headphones are basic, and the sound isn’t perfect, but I love how compact they are; the battery life is good, and they stay put with good comfort on my runs. The Garmin Forerunner 970 is probably my top pick of the running watches I’ve tested this year. Lovely looking, impressive array of training firepower and a “wow” bright screen. If you’re looking for a great all-round, versatile running shoe, the Saucony Endorphin Speed 5 has been a pick from the dozens of shoes I’ve tested this year. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kieran-alger">Kieran Alger</a></strong></p> <p> ***</p> <h2>Scents and sensibility</h2>    <p><strong>Jo Loves Chestnut candle</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/jo-loves-a-home-candle-roasted-chestnuts/13318724/" > £55 at Cult Beauty </a>      <p><strong>Kirsten lamp</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/check-small-table-lamp/p/hbp60589884" > £49.50 at M&amp;S </a>  <p>This Jo Loves Roasted Chestnuts candle is the best candle in the world. Hands down. I love it so much that I started to hunt down mini versions on Vinted. Candles are often given to people who aren’t keen on them, so many bargains can be found. I also got the Kirsten lamp from Marks &amp; Spencer that everyone loved, and the joy-to-price ratio is unmatched. <a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/checkerboard-table-lamp/p/hbp60693413">M&amp;S even does a slightly different version</a> now, too. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rhiannon-evans">Rhiannon Evans</a></strong> </p> <p>***</p> <h2>Suits you</h2>    <p><strong>Adidas tracksuit bottoms</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.adidas.co.uk/adicolor-classic-firebird-loose-track-tracksuit-bottoms/KA7743.html" > £60 at Adidas </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.asos.com/adidas-originals/adidas-originals-firebird-loose-track-pants-in-burgundy/prd/207980929" > £60 at Asos </a>  <p>Without doubt, it’s my Adidas Originals loose tracksuit bottoms. I wear them around the house and can dress them up with a blazer. Two pairs just aren’t enough, so I’ve just ordered the new brown shade, perfect for autumn. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sabine-wiesel">Sabine Wiesel</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Outdoor comfort and family fun</h2>    <p><strong>Hex chair</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://wildbounds.com/products/hex-2-longback-chair-olive-slate-grey" > £84.95 at Wildbounds </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crazy-Creek-LongBack-Backpacking-Adjustable/dp/B0CJMTJ724" > £78.97 at Amazon </a>  <p>The Crazy Creek LongBack Hex chair has been my most used outdoor kit this year. It’s so simple, so comfortable and so easy to tuck in a backpack, beach bag or throw in the car. Most outdoor chairs are bulky and cumbersome, but this is genius. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ella-foote">Ella Foote</a></strong></p>    <p><strong>Machi Koro</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.board-game.co.uk/product/machi-koro-5th-anniversary-expansion-bundle/" > £21.99 at Zatu Games </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://magicmadhouse.co.uk/pandasaurus-games-machi-koro-5th-anniversary-expansions" > £23.99 at Magic Madhouse </a>  <p>We got this for our spirited nine-year-old, who loves a board game. It has been the most all-round entertaining game we have played as a family for a long time. He can play it with his friends as well as with us. Simple, entertaining and totally away from digital stimulants! <strong>EF</strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Craft beer and cosy clothing</h2>    <p><strong>Schöfferhofer Radler wheat beer, 12 x 500ml</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/82421/schofferhofer-radler-happy-pack-12-cans" > £22.95 at The Whisky Exchange </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://beerhunter.co.uk/products/schofferhofer-pineapple-grapefruit-german-low-alcohol-beer-mixed-case-2-5-abv-12-pack" > £24.95 at Beerhunter </a>  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/21/britain-lost-100-indie-breweries-last-year-says-trade-body">craft beer revolution may be stalling</a>, but I’ve loved the way indie brewing has shaken up the blokey old world of boozing. My product of the year is <a href="https://www.schoefferhofer.com/wheat-beer-mix/">Schöfferhofer wheat beer</a>. At 2.5%, this fruity beer is light enough to keep me from getting drunk, but doesn’t have the thin or synthetic taste that some low-percenters do. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jane-hoskyn">Jane Hoskyn</a></strong></p> <p><em><strong>For more mid-strength alcohol ideas, see our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/22/best-mid-strength-low-abv-drinks">guide to the best</a></strong></em></p>    <p><strong>Musto Corsica waterproof jacket</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.musto.com/en_gb/corsica-jkt-20-fw-82011?color=78" > From £126 at Musto </a>  <p>My other standout recent buy is my Musto Corsica jacket. I’m under 5ft tall and I love a bargain, so I’ve always tended to buy £10 coats designed for 13-year-old boys and have them fall apart on me within months. A desire to stay dry – and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/07/how-to-buy-less">basic shopping wisdom</a> – demanded that I spend more on a carefully chosen item that would go the distance. It has already proved its worth on hikes. Even the fact that my arms are slightly too short for its sleeves (my fault, not its) means my hands stay extra toasty. <strong>JH</strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Brilliant for babies and toddlers</h2>    <p><strong>Nuby baby bottle maker</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/3423859" > £40 at Argos </a>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nuby-RapidCool-Portable-Prepare-Dispenser/dp/B09VH5PCCJ" > £24.99 at Amazon </a>      <p><strong>Stokke Yoyo </strong><strong>pushchair</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/stokke-yoyo-pushchair-frame-and-6-colour-pack-black-toffee/p241554668" > £305 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.stokke.com/GBR/en-gb/prams/yoyo-prams-pushchairs/yoyo-stroller-6-months.html" > £339 at Stokke </a>      <p><strong>Vapour plug-in</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.superdrug.com/baby/baby-medicine/childrens-pain-relief/calpol-vapour-plug-5-refill-pads/p/743398" > £7.49 at Superdrug </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.boots.com/calpol-vapour-plug-and-nightlight-lavender-and-chamomile-plus-3-refill-pads-10307206" > £8.50 at Boots </a>  <p>As a new mum, three things have been far and away my best purchases. One, a Nuby RapidCool baby bottle maker. You pour boiled water into it, shake it, tap the top, and when the word “Nuby” changes from yellow to green, the water is the perfect temperature for baby formula. It says it takes two minutes, but often it’s far quicker. Two, the Yoyo BabyZen pram. It’s compact, so it fits in narrow hallways; it’s light, so you can lift it – with baby and shopping – on to a tube or bus; and it folds down so small that it fits in the overhead compartment in a plane. I got mine from Vinted.

Once a hole appears, you request a replacement and send a photo of your socks chopped in half. They then give you a code to order a new pair for free (delivery is free). I keep the chopped up ones and use them as hand warmers to go over the top of gloves for cold-weather cycling – or gardening. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sasha-muller">Sasha Muller</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>No, limescale, no!</h2>    <p><strong>Shower filter</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.diy.com/departments/tappwater-showerpro-shower-filter-water-filter-for-limescale-chlorine-more/4260657680628_BQ.prd" > £44 at B&amp;Q </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.boots.com/tappwater-showerpro-shower-filter-chrome-10375223" > £44 at Boots </a>  <p>My shower filter has not only improved my hair health, but also saved me from having to spend hours scrubbing limescale from my shower screen.
