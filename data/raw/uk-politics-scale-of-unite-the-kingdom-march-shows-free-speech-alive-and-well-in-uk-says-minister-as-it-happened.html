 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>The business secretary, <strong>Peter Kyle</strong>, said the number of people who turned out for the “Unite the Kingdom” protest – organised by the far-right activist <strong>Tommy Robinson</strong> – shows free speech is “alive and well” in the UK.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Kyle added that moments like Saturday’s demonstration were “klaxon calls to us in public life to redouble our efforts to address the big concerns that people right across our country have, and immigration is a big concern.”</p></li> 
   <li><p>Between 110,000 and 150,000 were estimated by police to have attended the event. The Met said in an update on Sunday that there were 24 arrests, including for common assault, actual bodily harm, affray and criminal damage.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Peter Kyle also told Sky News that <strong>Peter Mandelson</strong> had “singular talents” which meant his appointment as US ambassador had been seen as “worth the risks” despite warnings in the vetting process over his links with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, the late convicted child sex offender.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Kyle rejected that Mandelson was appointed as the UK’s top diplomat in Washington before security checks were completed. The Cabinet Office undertook an independent inquiry and presented information to the prime minister, he said.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Kyle told the BBC that it is “highly unlikely” Mandelson would have been appointed “if we had known the information we know now”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The Lib Dems are calling for an independent investigation into what was known about Mandelson’s friendship with Epstein at the time of his appointment as US ambassador.</p></li>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Nigel Farage is facing calls to say who paid for his trip to the US after a report that he could have breached parliamentary rules by failing to register a visit where he headlined a fundraiser for Donald Trump.</strong></p> 
  <p>The Reform UK leader did not disclose who funded the trip to Florida in March to appear as a special guest at a Republican party event in Tallahassee and did not report any possible earnings from it, The Sunday Times reported.</p> 
  <p>It was reported at the time that Farage had missed Prime Minister’s Questions ahead of his appearance at the event.</p> 
  <p>Tables for top-tier “Trump sponsors” at the “Disruptors Dinner” were said to cost $25,000.</p> 
  <p>MPs are required to register visits abroad within 28 days that cost more than £300 if they are not wholly paid for by the MP or public funds.</p> 
  <p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats called on the Clacton MP to disclose how the trip was funded.</p> 
  <p>A spokesman for Farage told the newspaper: “We thank The Sunday Times for bringing this to our attention, the record will be updated in due course.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Bridget Phillipson will pledge to take on Reform UK as the education secretary launches her bid for Labour’s deputy leadership.</strong></p> 
  <p>In a speech to supporters in Sunderland on Sunday, she will tell members to back her to unite the party and secure a second term for Labour. She will also say she plans to continue the campaigning role of Angela Rayner.</p> 
  <p>Phillipson is up against her former Cabinet colleague Lucy Powell, who lost her post as Commons leader in the reshuffle triggered when Rayner quit over an error in stamp duty payments.</p> 
  <p>PA News reports that Phillipson will say:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>You can use this contest to look backward, to pass judgment on what has happened in the last year, or you can use it to shape positively what happens in the run-up to the next election.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Back me so I can unite our party, deliver the change we want to see and beat Reform. Back me so, together, we can deliver that second term of Labour government.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Back me so, together, we can give more hope to families right across the country. Back me so, together, we give every young person the freedoms that for too long, too few enjoyed.”</em><br></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She will draw on her own backstory “from a tough street of council houses in the north-east all the way to the Cabinet”, and promise to run a campaign of “hope, not grievance”.</p> 
  <p>The Houghton and Sunderland South MP will say she plans to use her position to give members a “strong voice” at the Cabinet table.</p> 
  <p>“What can be achieved under a deputy leader with a seat at Cabinet, just look at Angela Rayner. Angela knew the importance of the role she had … I pledge to continue Angela Rayner’s campaigning role as deputy leader.”</p>

  <p>The Metropolitan police have said they will make “further arrests in the coming days and weeks”, following violence at the “Unite the Kingdom” march.</p> 
  <p>“A post-event investigation is under way, with officers working to identify other people involved in disorder with a view to making further arrests in the coming days and weeks,” the force said.</p> 
  <p>The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, condemned the violent scenes on Saturday and vowed that anyone “taking part in criminal activity will face the full force of the law”.</p>

  <p>In light of the mainstreaming of inflammatory rhetoric about migrants and high concern among the public about the issue, my colleague <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-goodier">Michael Goodier</a> has crunched the numbers to show what the immigration figures for the UK really show us. Here is an extract from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/14/what-do-the-immigration-figures-for-the-uk-really-show">his piece</a>:</p> 
  <p>Despite public concern about immigration rising in recent months, official figures show that the number of people coming into the country is falling – albeit from a record high peak.</p> 
  <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that net migration has mainly hovered between 200,000 and 300,000 people<strong> </strong>a year since 2011. However, since Brexit came into effect on New Year’s Eve 2020, there has been a large increase in the number of immigrants. Commentators and critics have called this the “Boriswave”, as it occurred following the new post-Brexit immigration system introduced by Boris Johnson.</p> 
  <p>Recent figures show that the wave is subsiding. Net migration fell by half in 2024, and recent rule changes mean it is expected to fall further. This is largely because of a decrease in health and care visas. Fewer people are now escaping the Ukraine war or fleeing the Taliban through the now closed Afghan humanitarian scheme.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office spokesperson <strong>Sarah Olney</strong> <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-angela-rayner-starmer-labour-badenoch-farage-reform-12593360">has been quoted by Sky News</a> as having said the party is calling for an independent investigation into what was known about Peter Mandelson’s friendship with Jeffery Epstein at the time of his appointment as US ambassador. </p> 
  <p>“The government has serious questions to answer about what they knew and when,” Olney was quoted as having said. “The current explanations just don’t add up.”</p> 
  <p>“We need an urgent independent inquiry into how details of Mandelson’s ties with a convicted paedophile slipped through the cracks of government vetting,” she added.</p> 
  <p>“This inquiry must be given access to all the relevant messages, texts and documents so it can get to the bottom of this appalling mess.”</p>

  <p><em>This report was written by my colleagues <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker">Peter Walker</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/eleni-courea">Eleni Courea</a><strong> </strong>and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pippacrerar">Pippa Crerar</a></em>:</p> 
  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> has been warned that time is running out to repair his faltering leadership, with Labour MPs beginning to ask whether he could be challenged as prime minister.</p> 
  <p>After a disastrous week in which <strong>Angela Rayner</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/angela-rayner-stands-down-over-stamp-duty-row">resigned</a> and <strong>Peter Mandelson</strong> was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations">sacked</a> as ambassador to Washington, a number of MPs said a challenge was likely if local and Welsh elections went badly next May.</p> 
  <p>Some said the one thing now protecting Starmer was the lack of an agreed replacement.</p> 
  <p>“Personally, I think the clock is ticking,” one MP said. “It sometimes happens to people who are incredibly well meaning, but you can pass that tipping point and can’t recover.”</p> 
  <p>It came as <strong>Lucy Powell</strong>, who was sacked from the cabinet in the reshuffle after Rayner’s departure and who is standing to replace her as deputy leader, called for a “change of culture” in a Downing Street she described as overly factional and error-prone.</p> 
  <p>“We’ve got a bit of ar groupthink happening at the top, that culture of not being receptive to interrogation, not being receptive to differing views,” Powell <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/12/labour-deputy-contender-lucy-powell-calls-for-culture-change-at-no-10">told the Guardian</a>.</p> 
  <p>The only MP to go public in saying Starmer should go is <strong>Clive Lewis</strong>, a regular critic of the government from the left of the party.</p> 
  <p>The Norwich South MP told BBC’s The Week in Westminster programme that Starmer had “lost control within the first year”, adding: “We don’t have the luxury of carrying on this way with someone who I think increasingly, I’m sorry to say, just doesn’t seem up to the job.”</p>

  <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> accused Keir Starmer and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> MPs of “lying to the whole country about what they knew regarding Mandelson’s involvement with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein”.</p> 
  <p>The Tory leader wrote on X: “If No 10 had those emails for 48 hours before acting, it means he lied at PMQs and ministers lied again about new additional information. These are yet more errors of judgement. The prime minister has very serious questions to answer. The only way to clear this up is full transparency about who knew what, and when.”</p> 
  <p>Starmer reportedly defended Mandelson in the House of Commons two days after details of the damning emails between the former ambassador to the US and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> were passed to Downing Street.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations">The prime minister sacked Mandelson</a> on Thursday after emails were published revealing that he had told Epstein “your friends stay with you and love you” while the disgraced financier was facing jail for sex offences.</p> 
  <p>The Foreign Office received a media enquiry outlining details of the messages on Tuesday, which was passed to No 10, PA Media and the Times reported.</p> 
  <p>The permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office, Oliver Robbins, allegedly asked Mandelson about the veracity of the emails but did not receive a response until Wednesday afternoon, a government source told PA (you can read more in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/13/keir-starmer-peter-mandelson-jeffrey-epstein-emails">this story</a> by my colleague Donna Ferguson).</p> 
  <p>The friendship between Epstein and Mandelson has come back into the spotlight after Democratic members of the US House oversight committee released Epstein’s 50th “birthday book”, in which Mandelson called him “my best pal” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/09/peter-mandelson-called-jeffrey-epstein-my-best-pal-in-50th-birthday-letter">in a handwritten note</a>.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer's appointment of Mandelson as US ambassador was 'worth the risk' at the time, minister says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Keir Starmer’s judgment has come under serious scrutiny after the prime minister stripped his political ally <strong>Peter Mandelson</strong> as ambassador to the US amid fresh scrutiny over his years-long friendship with Jeffery Epstein, the late convicted child sex offender.</p> 
  <p>The business secretary, <strong>Peter Kyle</strong>, has been asked about it during the morning rounds today and defended the prime minister for taking swift action. He said Mandelson’s “singular talents” meant he was deemed “worth the risk” to appoint after two vetting processes turned up information that was already public.</p> 
  <p>In an interview with Sky News, Kyle insisted it was not correct that Mandelson was appointed ambassador to the US before security checks were completed.</p> 
  <p>“The Cabinet Office did an independent inquiry into the appointment, as they do in every public appointment of this nature, and the information, that was presented to the prime minister.” he told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips.</p> 
  <p>“The second process was obviously a political process where there are political conversations done in No 10 about all the other aspects of an appointment of this nature.</p> 
  <p>“Now both of these things turned up information that was already public and a decision was made that based on Peter’s singular talents in this area, that the risk of appointing knowing what was already public was worth the risk.</p> 
  <p>“Now of course we have seen the emails which were not published at the time, were not public and not even known about, and that has changed the situation.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Saturday's protest should be a 'klaxon call' for politicians to 'redouble efforts to address public's big concerns' - minister</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The business and trade secretary, <strong>Peter Kyle</strong>, was asked about the protests again on the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg Sunday politics programme. He echoed his earlier comments, saying the demonstration proved that freedom of association and freedom of speech are “alive and well” in the UK.</p> 
  <p>He said Elon Musk’s comments to the crowd, including that they must “fight back or die” and that “violence is coming”, were “totally inappropriate”.</p> 
  <p>Kyle said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>I thought they were slightly incomprehensible comments that were totally inappropriate. But what we saw yesterday was over 100,000 people who were expressing freedom of association, freedom of speech and proving that both of those things are alive and well in this country.</em></p> 
   <p><em>A small minority of people who were protesting committed acts of violence against our police for which they should and they will be held accountable.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Kuenssberg<em><strong> </strong></em>asks Kyle if it worries him as a senior politician that that number of people would turn out to hear the far-right activist Tommy Robinson speak. He replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>What worries me most is the divisions in our society, in other societies, in other democratic societies. It is not even the left and the right at the moment. There are communities that are being driven further apart and there are figures such as Tommy Robinson that is able to touch into a sense of disquiet and grievance in our society.</em></p> 
   <p><em>A lot of it goes back to its roots in the financial crisis and the impact it had on communities around the country and we haven’t been able to bring our communities back together again since.</em></p> 
   <p><em>So I think these are moments that are klaxon calls to us in public life to redouble our efforts to address the big concerns that people right across our country have, and immigration is a big concern.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Sadiq Khan says 'violence and attacking police officers' at London rally were 'completely unacceptable'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Sadiq Khan</strong>, the Mayor of London, said the pockets of violence at the protest yesterday were “completely unacceptable”.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://x.com/MayorofLondon/status/1966946536098852968">In a post on X</a> thanking the Metropolitan police for its work, he wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>My thanks go to all the officers policing protests today. Most protestors were peaceful, but a number of officers were assaulted and arrests have been made.</p> 
   <p>Violence and attacking police officers is completely unacceptable.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The Met said 25 people had been arrested for a range of offences in what it described as “wholly unacceptable” violence.</p> 
  <p>Marchers were arrested for a range of offences, including affray, violent disorder, assaults and criminal damage.</p> 
  <p>Because of the size of the demonstration, the Met was supported by officers from other forces, including Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, and Devon and Cornwall.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Scale of Tommy Robinson protest shows free speech is 'alive and well' in the UK, minister says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK politics. </p> 
  <p>At least 25 people were arrested and 26 police officers were injured – including four who were seriously hurt – at Tommy Robinson’s <strong>“Unite the Kingdom”</strong> protest in London yesterday, the Metropolitan police said.</p> 
  <p>The protest, thought to be the largest nationalist event in decades, saw between 110,000 and 150,000 people turn out, significantly exceeding the estimates of organisers. Elsewhere, about 5,000 anti-racism campaigners mounted a counter-protest.</p> 
  <p>The crowds were addressed by Elon Musk, who dialled in via video link and spoke of “the rapidly increasing erosion of Britain”, before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/13/elon-musk-calls-for-dissolution-of-parliament-at-far-right-rally-in-london">calling for the dissolution of the UK parliament</a>.</p>

  <p>Business and trade secretary <strong>Peter Kyle</strong> was asked by Sky News’ Trevor Phillips this morning if the demonstration – organised by far-right activist Tommy Robinson <strong>– </strong>“disturbed” him. </p> 
  <p>Kyle said the number of people who turned out for the protest shows free speech is “alive and well” in the UK.</p> 
  <p>He explained:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>It doesn’t disturb me, because it’s actually proof that we live in a country where free speech, free association, is alive and well. </em></p> 
   <p><em>The bit that disturbs me is that when a minority go to an extreme and end up perpetrating violence against the police. That is unacceptable and those people should and will pay for it.</em> </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>“The flag was waved quite a lot and I do want to make the point that the flag belongs to all of us,” Kyle added. </p> 
  <p>“That flag means a lot of different things to a lot of people, but it is about essential British and English values and principles.”</p>
