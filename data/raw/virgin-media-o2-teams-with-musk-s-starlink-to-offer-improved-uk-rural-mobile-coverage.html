<p>Virgin Media O2 has announced a partnership with Elon Musk’s satellite company aimed at improving rural mobile network coverage in the UK.</p> <p>The deal with Starlink is said to be the first of its kind to allow consumers to automatically connect phones via satellites when no standard mobile signal is available, tapping into the company’s position as the world’s largest satellite-to-mobile constellation.</p> <p>The service is scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026, making it the first British operator to use Starlink’s more than 650 satellites to connect to compatible customer handsets.</p> <p>The new service, O2 Satellite, will allow customers to use messaging and data services in more rural areas for an extra monthly fee. Initially, voice and video calls will not be available, although WhatsApp voice calls may work.</p> <p>Lutz Schüler, the chief executive of Virgin Media O2, said: “This UK-first partnership is another example of Virgin Media O2 innovating to provide a better experience and peace of mind for our customers on top of the £700m we are already investing in our mobile network this year.</p> <p>“Starlink is a clear leader in this space, operating the world’s most advanced satellite constellation, which makes it the right partner to complement our existing coverage and support Virgin Media O2’s ambition to deliver reliable mobile connectivity across the UK.”</p> <p>The telecoms minister, Liz Lloyd, said: “This partnership demonstrates exactly how private sector innovation can deliver real benefits for people across the UK, supporting our mission to drive growth and ensure no community is left behind.</p> <p>“Whether you’re running a farm in Cumbria or hiking in the Cairngorms, you’ll soon have the peace of mind that comes with reliable coverage.”</p> <p>In the UK, Starlink has mainly been used by households and businesses in rural areas who have historically had poor broadband access.</p> <p>It is also used by “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/10/doomsday-prepping-america">preppers</a>”– people who actively prepare for emergencies –and by those who buy the tech as fans of Musk, who have fuelled its adoption across the country. However, this year the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/16/deeply-uncomfortable-uk-starlink-users-switch-off-over-musks-political-machinations">reported</a> that some Starlink customers had dropped their subscriptions amid frustrations with the billionaire’s political machinations, including his role in Donald Trump’s administration before his resignation in late May.</p> <p>Still, its popularity in some parts of the UK has resulted in the company levying an extra “congestion charge” for areas where there is high demand.</p> <p>The company provides ultrafast broadband speeds via a constellation of satellites, with British customers typically paying from £75 a month for a 30-day term, plus £299 for hardware.</p> <p>Starlink is also known for its use in Ukraine. The company’s terminals were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/12/ukraine-accuses-russia-forces-using-elon-musk-starlink">rushed there</a> after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p> <p>The Starlink partnership comes amid reports that Virgin Media O2 is in talks to buy up Netomnia, the UK’s fourth-largest broadband network operator. The takeover could be worth £2bn, according to the Financial Times, and would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/02/vodafone-invest-three-uk-merger-coverage-mobile-tariffs">further consolidate</a> the UK telecoms market. The rival CityFibre is also interested in buying Netomnia, Bloomberg reported. </p>
