<p>Donald Trump has slapped a 50% tariff on Brazil over what he called the “witch-hunt” against former president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/jair-bolsonaro">Jair Bolsonaro</a> and demanded that it end immediately.</p> <p>The US president said the levy on Brazil would be “separate from all sectoral tariffs” as he also targeted seven other countries for steep tariffs and criticised the trial of Bolsonaro, whom he has described as a friend and hosted at his Mar-a-Lago resort.</p> <p>The US supreme court, meanwhile, denied a request by Florida officials to lift a judge’s order barring them from carrying out arrests of undocumented US immigrants entering the state while a legal challenge plays out.</p> <p>And the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has issued sanctions against Francesca Albanese, a UN official investigating abuses in Gaza, in the latest US effort to punish critics of Israel’s war in the territory.</p> <p>Here are the key US politics stories at a glance:</p>  <h2>Trump announces 50% tariff on Brazil, citing ‘witch-hunt’ against Bolsonaro</h2>  <p>On Wednesday afternoon, Trump avoided his standard form letter with <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/brazil">Brazil</a>, and criticized the trial Jair Bolsonaro is facing over trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. “This Trial should not be taking place,” Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social on Wednesday. “It is a witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!”</p> <p>Brazil’s president, <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a>, rejected Trump’s demand that legal proceedings against Bolsonaro be dropped and his claim that a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports was necessary to close a trade deficit that does not, in fact, exist.</p> <p><a
