<p>Morning everyone. Israel has announced a new plan for an “intensified” offensive in Gaza, which officials said was about “conquering” the territory, moving the population and establishing a sustained presence.</p> 
<p>At home the fallout from Labor’s spectacular election win continues. We look at key seats where Chinese Australians turned against the Coalition, and the waning power of the Murdoch press. In the US, the White House is dealing with pushback against Donald Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on foreign films.</p>

<p>We have an excellent selection of analysis about what shaped the election result, and what lessons can be drawn from the outcome. First, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/06/far-worse-than-morrison-where-did-the-coalition-lose-the-election">our number crunchers</a> have been trying to identify the main demographic groups that swung to Labor – and they include urban voters, women, young people and Australians whose first language is not English. One of the most salient lessons from the election is that Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp press <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/06/as-australias-election-result-reminds-us-news-corp-no-longer-has-the-power-to-sway-voters">no longer has the power to influence elections</a>, writes Margaret Simons, with nothing to show for full-throated editorial support in papers across the country. Another lesson, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2025/may/06/australia-has-backed-a-rapid-shift-to-renewable-energy-and-given-labor-a-chance-on-climate-how-will-it-act">our environment editor argues</a>, is that there will never be a better chance to strike ahead with more ambitious plan for renewable energy.</p>
