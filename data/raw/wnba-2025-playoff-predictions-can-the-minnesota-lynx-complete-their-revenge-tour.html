<h2>Is the postseason better off without the Reese-Clark storyline?</h2> <p><strong>Yes and no.</strong> Yes because the worst talking heads who turn the storyline into something nastier and ugly will not be drawing the air out of WNBA discussion. No, because genuine rivalry is one of the best parts of sports, and Reese v Clark is particularly captivating. <strong>Jakub Frankowicz</strong></p> <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Both of them have plenty of years ahead to avail themselves of the playoff stage. This year the games can stand on their own, relying less on tabloid-style fodder while highlighting the W’s depth and lifting more players into the spotlight. <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong></p> <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Perhaps the only silver lining to the fact that both athletes have missed chunks of this season due to injury is that the toxic elements of the Reese-Clark storyline are non-existent coming into the postseason. Hopefully, that’s a trend that carries over to next year, when (presumably) both will be back on the floor in top form. <strong>Stephanie Kaloi</strong></p> <p><strong>Not really.</strong> It certainly wouldn’t have been a real storyline given the sorry state of the Chicago Sky, who only made the playoffs last year because Teresa Witherspoon was coaching. But it does smart not have either player in the mix – especially Clark, whom you’d have to think would have lifted Indiana out of the first round. <strong>Andrew Lawrence</strong></p> <p><strong>I assume so</strong>. It feels like people are holding on to a college-era feud that’s years old at this point. Meanwhile, Angel Reese clearly has bigger fish to fry – namely, a very real and completely valid tension within her own Chicago Sky organization. <strong>Tiana Randall</strong></p> <h2>Team that will be missed the most</h2> <p>Another season sans a playoff appearance for the <strong>Los Angeles Sparks</strong>, who have gone five years without a trip to the postseason. The shock Kelsey Plum trade brought them closer, but they still came up short. A postseason without Plum’s fiery competitiveness and long-range sharpshooting will be just a bit more dull. <strong>JF</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Dallas Wings</strong>. No Paige, no party. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>It feels strange to say because they’re dead last in the standings, but not seeing the <strong>Dallas Wings</strong> out there will hurt a little bit. The team has largely operated seemingly in chaos most of the season, and many have questioned the leadership of both their GM and head coach, but they have a lot of heart. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>The <strong>LA Sparks</strong> looked primed for a playoff berth after kicking off the season by trading for Plum. But in the end the team couldn’t overcome injuries to Julie Allemand, Rickea Jackson and Cameron Brink – who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/09/cameron-brink-sparks-wnba-return-injury-impact">returned to the Sparks</a> halfway through the season after tearing her ACL last year. At full strength, this team would’ve been a tough out. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p>I was genuinely surprised to see the <strong>Washington Mystics</strong> miss out on a playoff spot. While their season was marked by inconsistent performances, their wins weren’t just wins, they were often very big ones against great teams. What stood out most, though, was how cohesive and connected the team looked on the court. Despite the ups and downs, there was a clear sense of chemistry, especially with the addition of impressive rookies like Sonia Citron, who brought a promising energy to the organization. <strong>TR</strong></p>    <h2>High seed at risk of going out early</h2> <p>The <strong>New York Liberty</strong> have limped into the playoffs, both figuratively and literally, having lost nearly every piece of their rotation to injury at some point. If they can’t get fully healthy and gel before their first-round matchup, look for the defending champs to head to an early exit. <strong>JF</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Phoenix Mercury</strong>. Their first-round draw is a stacked New York Liberty team who are finally healthy as they launch their title defense. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Phoenix Mercury</strong>. As solid as they were in the regular season, the other teams who earned home-court advantage – Minnesota, Atlanta and Las Vegas – are hungrier and have more to prove. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>Am I crazy for picking <strong>Las Vegas</strong>? They haven’t lost in over a month and may well be due. Meanwhile, Seattle, where former MVP Nneka Ogwumike and six-time all-star Skylar Diggins lead the league’s fifth-best shooting outfit, only need to win <em>twice</em> to advance. The Storm split their four games against the Aces this season already. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p>Although the <strong>Atlanta Dream</strong> are somewhat of an underdog in these rankings, they’ve proven they can deliver consistent wins. However, they can be unpredictable when facing stronger, more established teams. With standout players like Alisha Gray, Rhyne Howard, and Brittney Griner, the talent is undeniable. Still, I’m not convinced they have the experience or composure to hold their own in clutch moments against top-tier competition. <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>Long shot to win</h2> <p>The <strong>Golden State Valkyries</strong> had a strong first season in the league, with Veronica Burton looking like a contender for Most Improved Player. But it may not be enough despite a terrific advantage on their home court, where they’ve set a record this season for the highest attendance in WNBA history. <strong>JF</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Seattle Storm</strong>’s playoff chances were dicey enough after a wildly inconsistent regular season. But that was before they had the misfortune of drawing a scorching-hot Las Vegas team that closed out the regular season with 16 wins on the trot. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Valkyries</strong> would face an incredibly steep battle, but their season has had a bit of magic to it. If they can get back into Ballhalla and tap into what Natalie Nakase has drilled all season, it’s not entirely wild to believe they could pull off the biggest surprise in league history. After all, they’ve kind of been doing that the entire time. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>No franchise in any North American league has ever won a championship in its expansion season. The <strong>Valkyries</strong> have the absolute smallest statistical chance to do the impossible only because they beat out an injury ravaged LA squad (see above) for the final playoff spot. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p>Although the <strong>Indiana Fever</strong> have clinched a playoff spot, they’re barely hanging on by a thread. Key players like Caitlin Clark, Aari McDonald, and Sophie Cunningham are sidelined with injuries, along with important role players like Sydney Colson. They’re lacking serious depth and are being forced to probably out perform their talents. With so many stars out, fan engagement may also dip, and in a league where fan culture plays a big role in pushing teams forward, that could be a major setback for their championship hopes. <strong>TR</strong></p>    <h2>Most important player this postseason</h2> <p><strong>Alyssa Thomas</strong> has always been a jack of all trades, even before her move to Phoenix this season. But she’s taken it to another level in 2025, with a remarkable <em>eight</em> triple doubles. No team’s hopes ride on a single player more than the Mercury do with Thomas. <strong>JF</strong></p> <p><strong>A’ja Wilson.</strong> No one else blends defensive dominance, scoring versatility and leadership with her consistency under pressure. She anchors Las Vegas’s defense as an elite rim protector while commanding double-teams offensively, freeing teammates to thrive. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>A’ja Wilson.</strong> She’s led the Aces on one if the most impactful team comebacks we’ve seen this season, is a very likely 2025 MVP and will probably end up taking the team on a deep run. She is (always, inevitably) the player to watch. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Napheesa Collier.</strong> She was the most important player last year, the best end-to-end player in the game this year, and should beat Wilson to the MVP with an assist from voter fatigue. The Lynx haven’t exactly been shy about expressing how salty they still are about the way last season’s championship ended and, as ever, Phee will be key to them exacting revenge. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p><strong>Napheesa Collier</strong>. The Minnesota Lynx are a strong team with a clear hunger to win, especially after the sting of what many saw as a snub in the last championship. But despite their talent, there seems to be a lot of noise and distraction surrounding the organization this season. That’s where Collier comes in. She has ability to center the team, refocus their energy, and push them to reprioritize, which could be exactly what the Lynx need to make a serious run at the title. <strong>TR</strong></p>    <h2>Playoff semi-finalists</h2> <p>Las Vegas Aces, Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty, Indiana Fever. <strong>JF</strong></p> <p>Atlanta Dream, Las Vegas Aces, New York Liberty, Minnesota Lynx <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Atlanta Dream, Las Vegas Aces, New York Liberty, Minnesota Lynx <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Minnesota Lynx, Phoenix Mercury <strong>AL</strong></p> <p>Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty, Las Vegas Aces, Atlanta Dream <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>The champion will be ...</h2> <p><strong>Las Vegas Aces.</strong> They’ll meet Minnesota in the finals and Becky Hammon’s red-hot side will take home a third title in four years. A couple weeks ago I would have said the Lynx, who were a questionable call away from winning in 2024 and returned their entire core. But Vegas have won 16 straight to close out the regular season with reigning MVP Wilson leading the charge. Their depth still lacks compared to the Lynx, but any matchup between the two would be electric. <strong>JF</strong></p> <p><strong>Minnesota Lynx.</strong> Cheryl Reeve claimed her team was robbed after coming <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/20/new-york-liberty-wnba-champions-game-report">this close</a></em> to winning it all last year and the Lynx have been on a revenge tour ever since. So far, so good. With the league’s top defense and elite three-point shooting, they can suffocate opponents on one end and punish them on the other. Collier’s MVP-level brilliance anchors a roster that thrives on depth, ball movement and chemistry. Add in veteran poise and total buy-in to Reeve’s system and the Lynx stand as the team to beat. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Minnesota Lynx.</strong> I see a Lynx-Dream Finals, a rematch of 2013 but with Atlanta stronger than ever. The Dream know how to trouble Minnesota; they handed the Lynx two of their nine defeats this year, both with and without Collier. But this Lynx team is deeper, steadier and built for the biggest stage. Collier’s leadership and their collective poise should carry Minnesota to another championship. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Minnesota Lynx.</strong> I picked ‘em last year and would have been right if it hadn’t been for Alanna Smith’s controversial foul on the Liberty’s Breanna Stewart with 5.2 seconds left in Game 5. The Lynx have been on a revenge tour all season, starting strong and staying that way to lock up the top seed in the bracket. But as ever, I expect it’ll be the strategy of Reeve that’ll make the difference. I simply cannot see her losing a WNBA finals series in back-to-back years. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p><strong>Minnesota Lynx</strong> have an insatiable hunger for redemption. That championship loss in 2024 seems to have left a deep mark, and it’s evident in how they’ve approached their games this season. They’ve been incredibly consistent in team basketball, showing strong court vision, and offensive play. Their overall health has also played a key role; having a solid, mostly injury-free roster makes a big difference. Plus, the addition of standout newly traded players like DiJonai Carrington is already making an impact, especially on the defensive end. I think it will probably come down to the New York Liberty and Lynx again and the Lynx will take it home. <strong>TR</strong></p>
