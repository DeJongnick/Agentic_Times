<p>Late-night hosts have questioned Donald Trump’s cognitive abilities as he makes further blunders during his second term.</p> <h2><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOyyvmpoQhM"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cOyyvmpoQhM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers replayed clips of various rightwingers talking about Joe Biden’s cognitive decline when he was president and then told viewers that the same people should be more aware of Trump having similar issues.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/09/jimmy-kimmel-trump-national-guard-deployment">Jimmy Kimmel on Trump’s national guard deployments: ‘Incredibly dangerous and unnecessary’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, he repeated the debunked claim that he predicted Osama bin Laden would engage in mass terrorist activity one year before 9/11. Meyers played footage of him slurring a catalogue of errors to a crowd. “Finding the dementia in that clip is like finding Waldo in a book called Oops! All Waldos,” he said.</p> <p>Meyers said “the president’s brain is mush” before playing footage of him not knowing what habeas corpus is. ‘The president should probably know what it is,” he said.</p> <p>Trump appeared to think it was a person and when he asked who that was, Meyers joked: “Look at the panic in his eyes.”</p> <p>He asked for help from Kristi Noem, yet the head of homeland security has also previously struggled to define what it is, with Meyers showing footage of her being schooled by a senator. Meyers said that Republicans had become “so uninformed they’re turning senators into the principal from Billy Madison”.</p> <p>Trump has also been “threatening to jail elected officials who get in his way” with a bizarre Truth Social post where he claimed he would lock up the mayor of Chicago for not assisting Ice agents being sent to the city.</p> <p>Meyers said Trump is “deeply unhinged, detached from reality” and probably has dementia.</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H_6ICgjOEk"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9H_6ICgjOEk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>On Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host said we were living in “a golden age of awful”.</p> <p>This week sees Trump heading for his annual medical checkup which Kimmel said he wants to ace so he can take part in the “annual tradition of eating all of Eric’s trick or treat candy”.</p> <p>He also told anyone who thinks their job is bad to spare a thought for the person who “has to give Donald Trump a prostate exam”.</p> <p>Trump has also been heavily campaigning for the Nobel peace prize, something Kimmel ridiculed. “I’ve seen a lot of Oscar and Emmy campaigns but no one has vied for an award more rigorously,” he said.</p> <p>Kimmel said that “no one has suffered more unfairness” than Trump.</p> <p>In a social media post, the White House even sent out an image calling him “the peace president”. Kimmel joked that this man of peace is “sending a platoon to invade a yoga studio in Portland right now”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Noem is threatening to “lock up American protesters for life” after claiming to have captured founding members of Antifa, an “entirely imaginary organisation”.</p> <p>Trump’s wild claims about Portland has Kimmel thinking he is getting his intelligence briefings from “reruns of The Walking Dead”.</p> <p>All of this is just an “attempt to distract us from the Epstein files he doesn’t want us to see”.</p> <p>This also explains the government shutdown to avoid a potentially risky vote that could expose Trump. “It’s so brazen,” Kimmel said.</p> <p>He then played footage of a surprisingly reasonable Marjorie Taylor Greene who pointed this out in a TV interview. “I don’t know if she had a near-death experience or maybe a medicine ball fell of a shelf at the gym and hit her on the head,” he said.</p> <p>She also spoke about Trump’s inability to help Americans lower prices and raise wages. “Keep that up you’ll be dancing with Bad Bunny at the half-time show,” Kimmel said.</p>
