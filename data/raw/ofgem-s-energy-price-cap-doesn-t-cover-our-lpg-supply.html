<h1>Ofgem’s energy price cap doesn’t cover our LPG supply</h1>

<p><strong>I read that the energy price cap is going up again in April and people are struggling to pay their bills, but I can’t find any information relating to homes with bulk LPG tanks.</strong></p> <p><strong>Does anybody care about us? Is there any control over the </strong><strong>spiralling</strong><strong> cost of buying it?</strong></p> <p><strong>At the moment we pay 63p </strong><strong>a litre plus VAT, but our two-year deal ends in September. Our previous contract was at 40p </strong><strong>a litre, so we have already experienced a big jump in our household energy costs.</strong></p> <p><strong>We live in a small two-bedroom house and currently spend about £50 a month on electricity and just over £100 on gas. We rarely have the thermostat above 16C, and that’s only in the evenings.</strong></p> <p><strong>Yesterday I found out that the current rate for LPG is 98p </strong><strong>a litre. I’m worried it will be even higher by the time my contract runs out. I live in rural Mid Wales, so mains gas is never going to be an option. What can I do?</strong><br><strong>PG, </strong><em><strong>Powys</strong></em></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/23/why-does-gas-supplier-charge-486-to-remove-meter-when-others-do-it-free">Why does gas supplier charge £486 to remove meter when others do it free?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is an expensive domestic fuel used for cooking and heating by people who cannot access the UK mains gas grid. Whereas Ofgem’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/feb/25/average-annual-energy-bill-great-britain-energy-price-cap-gas-electricity-charges">price cap</a> puts a ceiling on how much suppliers can charge for conventional home energy, LPG is not covered. This fuel market is regulated by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/competition-commission">Competition and Markets Authority</a>.</p> <p>There is no price cap but the competition watchdog has taken steps to ensure consumers can switch supplier to get a better deal without being hit with punitive fees, as was once the case. The trade association Liquid Gas UK operates a <a href="https://www.liquidgasuk.org/domestic/supplier-search">supplier search</a> tool where you can input your postcode to find your cheapest local supplier.</p> <p>I asked whether there was Welsh government help for households keen to ditch pricey fossil fuel heating systems such as this, and it pointed to its <a href="https://www.gov.wales/nest-warm-homes-programme">Nest</a> service, which provides support, including links to grants and loans. For those in financial crisis, a discretionary assistance fund can award off-grid fuel payments of £500.</p> <p><em>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
