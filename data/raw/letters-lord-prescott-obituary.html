<p>While at the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/21/lord-prescott-john-prescott-obituary">John Prescott</a> contributed greatly to urban development and regeneration in 1998 by setting up the <a href="https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Urban_Task_Force">Urban Task Force</a>, under the chairmanship of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/19/richard-rogers-lord-rogers-obituary">Richard Rogers</a>. Its report <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/jul/21/regeneration.comment">Towards an Urban Renaissance</a> set out recommendations on how design excellence, social wellbeing and environmental responsibility might be better integrated through the delivery of urban policy that still have resonance today.<br><strong>Nick Bailey</strong></p> <p>In the early 1990s I found in the course of working for an agricultural planning consultancy that there was a reluctance to supply government policy documents to “commercial” interests. If I gave my company name when phoning departments they refused, whereas if I said I was a librarian inquiring for a researcher, they would supply the necessary item. </p> <p>John Prescott’s introduction of departmental websites and the digital provision of documents made such subterfuge unnecessary.<br><strong>Jancis Smith</strong><br></p>
