She suggested she would be different.</p> <p>But she also claimed business was at fault too.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>One of the biggest threats to free enterprise isn’t just government – it’s the corporatism and compliance culture that has taken over large parts of our economy.</p> <p>Big business today often spends more time lobbying for regulation than competing in the market.

But in Scotland, where devolution allows gives the Scottish government powers (which is is using) to vary tax rates, and some benefit payments, child poverty has fallen, the <strong>Scottish government</strong> says. Relative child poverty in Scotland is 9 points lower than in the UK as a whole.</p> <p>In a news release it explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Annual statistics published today show that compared with the previous year’s statistics, relative child poverty in 2023-24 reduced from 26% to 22% in Scotland while absolute child poverty fell from 23% to 17%. UK poverty statistics published today show levels of relative child poverty at 31% and absolute child poverty at 26%.</p> <p>Modelling published today suggests that UK government policies are “holding back” Scotland’s progress. It estimates the UK government could reduce relative child poverty by an additional 100,000 children in 2025-26 if it heeded Scottish government calls to end the two-child limit, replicate the Scottish child payment in universal credit, remove the benefit cap and introduce an essentials guarantee.</p> </blockquote> <p>Commenting on the figures, <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville</strong>, the Scottish government’s social justice secretary, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Eradicating child poverty is the Scottish government’s top priority and we are committed to meeting the 2030 targets unanimously agreed by the Scottish parliament.</p> <p>Our policies are having to work harder than ever to make a difference, against a backdrop of a continuing cost of living crisis, rising energy costs and UK government decision making. However, we know these policies are working.</p> <p>Statistics published today show that, although we have not met the interim child poverty targets, the proportion of children living in relative poverty has reduced and year-on-year rates are now lower than they have been since 2014-15, while the proportion in absolute poverty has also fallen with the annual figure the lowest in 30 years.</p> </blockquote> <p>This <a href="https://fraserofallander.org/a-step-in-the-right-direction-child-poverty/">briefing</a> from the <strong>Fraser of Allender Institute</strong> has more on Scotland’s child poverty record.

He explained:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There is a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an autumn budget. If so, she will need to come back for more; which will likely mean raising taxes even further. That risks months of speculation over what those tax rises might be – a raid on pensions, a wealth tax on the richest, another hike to capital gains tax? I mention those not to commend them, far from it, but to exemplify the kinds of taxes regarding which mere speculation about increases can cause economic harm. With no sense of a tax strategy, we have no idea which way the chancellor might turn.</p> </blockquote> <p>Reeves did not accept this when this point was put to her in interviews this morning. (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/27/spring-statement-rachel-reeves-labour-benefit-cuts-growth-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news?page=with%3Ablock-67e502658f08f13b630d7419#block-67e502658f08f13b630d7419"> 8.07am</a>.)</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said that Reeves’ obsession with ensuring she had exactly the same fiscal headroom as she did in the autumn budget was getting in the way of rational policy making. </strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We had £9.9bn of headroom in October. We have £9.9bn of headroom today. Astonishingly the numbers are within a mere £2m of one another. It is hard to believe this is a fluke. The Treasury has clearly worked overtime to ensure that precisely the same fiscal headroom remains today as was projected in October. This is not sensible. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said that, while the sickness and disability benefit cuts announced last week were “defensible” (because costs were rising so much), the decision to announce an extra £500m in cuts yesterday, just to make sure the fiscal headroom figure did not change, was a mistake. </strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Whilst unquestionably tough for those on the receiving end, those original cuts were defensible as a response to problems manifested by huge increases in numbers of claimants, and in spending. One could make a defence of them unrelated to the details of any particular fiscal rule. Coming back a week later with just a slightly bigger cut because that’s what’s needed to return the fiscal headroom to precisely where it was a few months ago risks undermining that case and discrediting attempts at genuine reform to the benefit system. If it was right last week to announce a halving of the health component of universal credit, it is hard to see why this week it is right to do more than that by halving it and then freezing it in cash terms.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said having little fiscal headroom, and then applying the fiscal rules rigidly, was “not conducive to a sensible policymaking process”.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is the combination of “iron-clad” pass/fail numerical fiscal rules and next to no headroom against them that is causing so many problems, leaving fiscal policy completely exposed to economic developments outside the government’s control. That is not conducive to a sensible policymaking process. This is not the OBR’s fault. It is the product of the chancellor’s choices.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said future government spending was “even more front-loaded than before”. </strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Spending growth is now set to be 2.5% in 2025-26, 1.8% in 2026-27 and 1.0% in each of the subsequent three years. One should always be sceptical of plans to be prudent, but only in the future. Front-loaded or not, the problem for the chancellor is that keeping to these growth rates overall will inevitably mean cuts for some departments in the years to come. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67e532488f0880ccce83d5aa" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-03-27T11:11:41.345Z">11.11am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Nearly 4m hours of raw sewage dumped in England’s waters last year</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Almost 4m hours of raw sewage was discharged into rivers and coastal waters in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/england">England</a> last year, with waterways that have the highest environmental protections subjected to days of pollution, <strong>Sandra Laville </strong>and<strong> Michael Goodier</strong> report.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/27/raw-sewage-hours-dumped-water-companies-england-last-year-data">Nearly 4m hours of raw sewage dumped in England’s waters last year</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67e52ec18f08287e917b12d4" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-03-27T11:05:59.685Z">11.05am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Scottish government will 'look at every lever' available to avoid benefit cuts, finance secretary says</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Shona Robison</strong>, the Scottish finance secretary, has said that the Scottish government will “look at every lever” it can pull to avoid cutting benefits.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland this morning, she said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We have invested in social security, things like the Scottish child payment for example, which is keeping thousands of children out of poverty.</p> <p>We’re in the business of keeping people out of poverty, not pushing children particularly into poverty.</p> <p>So we have made decisions over the years to prioritise the spend on our most vulnerable.</p> <p>In terms of going forward, the announcements yesterday are going to have a major impact on our budgets in the coming years and what we will be doing is to look at every lever we can use to avoid having to replicate the decision the UK Labour government have made.</p> </blockquote> <p>Under devolution, the Scottish government can now diverge from Westminster policy in some areas in relation to benefits.

Taking everything together, the burden of adjustment looks less slanted – but poorer, disabled households are still set to take the biggest hit. More generally, a combined squeeze that reduces incomes by around 1.5% in the lower-middle reaches of the spectrum declines to only 0.5% at the very top.</p> <p>Factoring those distributional decisions into the general outlook for growth and income makes for particularly grim reading. Across the poorer half of the country, the five years up to 2029 will see after-housing-costs incomes drop by around £500. In data going back to the early 1960s, larger drops for low-to-middle income families have only been seen twice before – in the sharp recession of the early 1990s, and then again in the immediate wake of the credit crunch. Disproportionate income reductions for sick and disabled people in poorer households are not going to help with any of these trends.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Resolution Foundation uses its own disposable household income figures that are different from the real household disposable incomes (RHDI) used by the OBR. One difference is that it focuses on non-pensioner households. In its report it says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Real income of the person one tenth of the way up the income distribution (‘p10’) or one fifth of the way up (‘p20’) is projected to be lower in 2029-30 than in 2023-24, by 5% and 1% respectively. In contrast, although even higher-income households may have lower incomes on this measure by 2029-30 than in 2024-25, they would nonetheless be better off than in 2023-24 given the strong growth in 2024-25.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the chart illustrating this.</p>    <p>And here is the passage from the report explaining the headline £500 figure.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>As ever, the outlook depends on many factors and is by no means set in stone, but any significant decline in incomes for the poorest in society would be historically notable. Figure 21 shows how real household incomes have grown for the poorest half of the non-pensioner population over every (rolling) five-year period since the 1960s. Over the next five years, the average equivalised income of the bottom half is projected to decline by 3%, or £500. And this scale of fall has only been (narrowly) worse during the early 1990s recession (1989 to 1994-95) and the financial crisis (2007-08 to 2012-13).</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is figure 21.</p>    <p><strong>Reeves</strong> yesterday told MPs almost the opposite. She said: “The OBR says today that households will be on average more than £500 a year better off under this Labour government.”</p> <p>Why are the figures so different? Because the OBR and the Resolution Foundation are measuring disposable income in different ways. This is what the <strong>Resolution Foundation</strong> says about why its measure implies a more negative outcome.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In small part this is due to our focus on non-pensioners; but also because ‘non-labour income’ is growing disproportionately within the OBR’s RHDI projections (as the labour share is assumed to fall back), and this income may be either entirely excluded from our analysis (in the case of ‘imputed rents’); under-represented (e.g. rental income); or because it is important for average income but less so for low-to-middle income households (e.g. for many elements of investment income).</p> </blockquote> <p>The <strong>OBR</strong> in part accepts this. This is what it says, for example, about the “imputed rent” part of its calculation.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Planning reforms boost incomes, offsetting some of the hit, as higher productivity raises wages and a larger housing stock means more compensation for housing services. Yet three quarters of the extra income from housing services comes as ‘imputed rent’ – what homeowners would receive if they rented out their home. This makes the boost less tangible for households.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-03-28T07:50:14.504Z">at 7.50am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-67e510c98f08134b916f362c" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-03-27T09:00:04.577Z">9.00am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Reeves says she won't accept free concert tickets again</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>In an interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain, <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong>, the chancellor, said she would not accept free tickets for concerts again in the future.</p> <p>Asked about the controversy about her decision to accept two corporate tickets for a Sabrina Carpenter concert at the O2, she repeated the line that she used <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/mar/26/spring-statement-rachel-reeves-budget-labour-benefit-cuts-pmqs-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-latest-news?page=with%3Ablock-67e436078f08134b916f2ecb#block-67e436078f08134b916f2ecb">at her press conference yesterday</a> – that a family member wanted to attend the concert (presumably one of her children, but she did not say that), and that she accepted tickets for a corporate box because security concerns meant it was not deemed safe for her to get normal tickets for the auditorium.</p> <p>Asked why she did not pay for the tickets, which have been described as being worth £600, Reeves said that tickets like this were not available for sale.</p> <p>She went on: “I don’t have any intention of doing this again.”</p> <p>Asked if she was admitting she made a mistake, she replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’m just saying I wouldn’t do it again.
