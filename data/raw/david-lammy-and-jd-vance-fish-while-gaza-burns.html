<p>The front page of Saturday’s Guardian print edition demonstrated both sides of the genocide in Gaza. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/08/us-and-uk-disagree-about-gaza-policy-jd-vance-suggests-before-david-lammy-meeting#img-2">main image</a> showed two western politicians, who could influence their leaders to stop Israel attacking innocent Palestinian people, laughing while they fished for the assembled media cameras, and the main headline was about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/08/israel-cabinet-approves-netanyahu-gaza-city-takeover-plan">planned takeover of Gaza City </a>by the Israeli government (Future of 1m Palestinians now hangs in the balance, 9 August). That will no doubt result in more killing and the likely forced relocation of people from their land – a war crime. </p> <p>History will record both men’s participation in this man-made human disaster by the Israeli government, but will either of them&nbsp;actually&nbsp;care? I&nbsp;don’t think so.<br><strong>Stuart Finegan</strong><br><em>Lewes, East Sussex</em></p> <p>• I can see it now, the BBC blurb for its new programme – Lammy &amp; Vance: Gone Fishing. Wonder at the beautiful Cotswolds countryside while the boys jest about “bring[ing] greater peace” to the world (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/08/us-and-uk-disagree-about-gaza-policy-jd-vance-suggests-before-david-lammy-meeting">US and UK disagree about Gaza policy, Vance suggests before Lammy meeting, 8 August</a>). Laugh out loud as JD and Dave spend hours fishing for fun, while wars rage, children are starved and their governments do nothing. When you hear their joke about old people behaving like placard-bearing terrorists, you’ll be hooked.<br><strong>Bernie Evans</strong> <br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>• Marina Hyde wondered if the foreign secretary and his vice-presidential house guest might go to Chevening’s ancient parish church of St Botolph on Sunday (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/08/jd-vance-holiday-uk-cotswolds">What could the Cotswolds possibly offer JD Vance? I suggest a swim in one of its rivers, 8 August</a>). If they made it, they perhaps heard the Book of Common Prayer readings for that Sunday, the Eighth after Trinity, which include these words of Jesus: “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207%3A14-16&amp;version=KJV">Matthew 7:15</a>).<br><strong>Rev Robert Titley</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
