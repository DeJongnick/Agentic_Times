A gender recognition certificate is there to show that someone is now transgender, but that doesn’t change their biology. So we need to make sure that the law is clear and the public bodies follow the law, not guidance from organisations that don’t understand it.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Kishwer Falkner</strong>, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), described yesterday’s supreme court ruling as “a victory for common sense, but only if you recognise that trans people exist. They have rights, and their rights must be respected – then it becomes a victory for common sense. It’s not a victory for an increase in unpleasant actions against trans people. We will not tolerate that.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Badenoch also criticised authorities in Hong Kong and China for not allowing Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse into Hong Kong. </strong>Hobhouse was attempting to visit family there when she was refused entry.

Matter closed.</strong></p> <p>Sixteen-year-olds are great fun but they are not grown up. They cannot marry in England and Wales, drive, smoke, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1969/24">get a tattoo</a> or buy alcohol on their own. They are legally classed as children and are supposed to be in <a href="https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/tag/minimum-school-leaving-age-uk/#:~:text=It%20is%20compulsory%20for%20young,Read%20more">formal education or training to 18</a>. Sixteen-year-olds have not taken to the streets demanding the right to the franchise, like the Chartists or suffragettes did.</p> <p>So why has Keir Starmer suddenly reiterated that <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/keir-starmer-16-year-olds-vote-done-5qzvt2zvr">he intends to enfranchise them to vote</a> in UK-wide elections? The only plausible answer is that he hopes they will vote for him. In a desperate attempt to <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/generation-z-times-survey-oped-rgnwccc9q">justify this manoeuvre</a>, he says that, if 16-year-old soldiers “are old enough to take a bullet for our country”, they should get the vote. (Likewise <a href="https://x.com/PolitlcsUK/status/1909627009761767921">if they are “old enough to work” and “pay taxes</a>”.)</p> <p>In fact, 16-year-olds are not old enough to “take a bullet”, since frontline army service is <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/joint-committees/human-rights/Briefing_from_Forces_Watch_age_of_recruitment.pdf">banned for under-18s.</a> Meanwhile, precious few 16-year-olds work, since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/mar/14/uk.education">Starmer’s own party, when last in power</a>, made it supposedly compulsory for them to remain in education or training to 18. As for taxes, younger children already pay VAT when they spend their pocket money.
