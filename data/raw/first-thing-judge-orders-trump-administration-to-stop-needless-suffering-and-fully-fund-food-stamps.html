<p>Good morning.</p> <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/ruling-snap-benefits-funding-trump">ordered the Trump administration</a> yesterday to find the money to fully fund food stamps for 42 million low-income Americans in November by today, in a rebuke to the government’s plan to only provide reduced aid during the shutdown.</p> <p>The district judge John J McConnell Jr criticized the administration’s plan to partly fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits in November. “The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur,” McConnell said. “That’s what irreparable harm here means.”</p> <p>“This should never happen in America,” he added.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What is the impact?</strong> After the administration said on Monday it would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap">only half</a> fund the program, Linda Nageotte, of Feeding America, said: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/06/snap-cuts-how-to-help">“One in eight people in our country right now</a> don’t have enough to eat.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>What’s the shutdown latest?</strong> It’s the longest in history, on to its 38th day. Lawmakers are in talks that could lead to a deal. But some Democratic legislators saw Tuesday’s electoral wins as evidence they should <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/us-government-shutdown-day-37">hold the line</a> to extract significant concessions.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Airlines cancel flights after aviation agency directive to cut air traffic</strong></h2>    <p>New York, Los Angeles and Chicago airports are among 40 that will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/us-40-airports-traffic-reduced">see reductions in flights from today</a> as a result of the government shutdown, according to a list distributed to the airlines.</p> <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has said flights are being reduced to maintain safety during the federal government shutdown, now the longest recorded and with no sign of a resolution between Republicans and Democrats to end the budget standoff.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What </strong><strong>details do we know</strong><strong>?</strong> The flight reductions, according to ABC News, will start at 4% on Friday and increase to 10%. Airports in cities including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami, LA, San Francisco, New York, Houston and Chicago will be affected.</p></li> <li><p><strong>What impact could the move </strong><strong>have?</strong> The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by the aviation analytics firm Cirium. They are likely to create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the country’s largest airports.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Democrats pay tribute to Nancy Pelosi after she announces retirement aged 85</strong></h2>    <p>Democrats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/nancy-pelosi-democrat-tributes-retirement">praised Nancy Pelosi</a> as a “heroic, trailblazing” member of the House of Representatives, an “icon” and the “greatest speaker in American history”, after her announcement that, after 20 terms in Congress, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/nancy-pelosi-retire-congress">she plans to retire</a>.</p> <p>The 85-year-old, the first woman to serve as speaker of the House and one of the most influential leaders in the party, said yesterday she would not be seeking re-election in 2026. “With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative,” Pelosi said.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Why the announcement now?</strong> Pelosi’s news came after Californians <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/california-proposition-50-explainer">approved proposition 50</a>, a redistricting measure intended to counter Trump’s efforts to shore up House seats in Texas and other red states in next year’s midterm elections.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Who might replace </strong><strong>her?</strong> Two Democrats have already jumped into the race: Saikat Chakrabarti, a former tech executive and the first chief of staff to the progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Scott Wiener, a state senator.
