<h1>From ‘mood hoovers’ to ‘energy vampires’ - here’s why negative friends are good for you</h1>

<p>I’m hungry for wisdom from others on dealing with midlife challenges, such as existential reckonings, fading relevance, developing a neck like a Salvador Dalí clock and a newfound passion for A Place in the Sun (just me? I can’t get enough of retirees’ apartment-complex conundrums). Most recently, I discovered Jamie Oliver’s words on turning 50 in an interview with <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/lifestyle/a69115510/jamie-oliver-dyslexia/">Good Housekeeping</a>: “I think if you’re going to have a good go at the second half of your life, you have to edit away all the noise,” he said. “Just be with lovely people. I’m avoiding negative people – ‘mood hoovers’ – and getting better at saying no.”</p> <p>My first thought was: isn’t there a tension between “avoiding negative people” and “getting better at saying no”? Doesn’t that mean he has to avoid <em>himself</em>? I know – it’s exactly the kind of thing a mood hoover would say, and that’s because I am one. Although in our community we actually prefer the expression “energy vampire”. Please avoid “wet blanket” or “fun sponge” too – all this comparing us to utilitarian household items is offensive; we have feelings (albeit mainly negative ones). I’ll accept “downbeat cashmere throw”, at a pinch.</p> <p>Perhaps you’re one too. Are you less the life and soul of the party and more its accountant or undertaker? Does your detailed response to “How are you?” have your interlocutor edging away uncomfortably? Do you greet “fun” activity suggestions with an expression that makes you look like you’ve swallowed a slug? Do you strongly identify with Eeyore; has a psychic ever told you your aura is grey?</p> <p>If so, you’re one of us, but it’s OK. Despite a whole self-help-inspired trend urging people to get rid of friends who “drain” them, I’d argue we offer real value. I reckon a mood hoover would have said something discouraging – or at least made a slug-swallowing face – when Jamie described his plan to write a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/09/jamie-oliver-apologises-after-childrens-book-criticised-for-stereotyping-first-nations-australians-ntwnfb">kids’ book</a> with an Australian First Nation main character without consulting Indigenous communities, which could have prevented a whole lot of problems, upset and offence. You don’t get that sort of service from “lovely people”.</p> <p>• Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist</p>
