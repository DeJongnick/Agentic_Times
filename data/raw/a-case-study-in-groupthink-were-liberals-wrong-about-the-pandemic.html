<h1>‘A case study in groupthink’: were liberals wrong about the pandemic?</h1>

<p>Were conservatives right to question <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Covid</a> lockdowns? Were the liberals who defended them less grounded in science than they believed? And did liberal dismissiveness of the other side come at a cost that Americans will continue to pay for many years?</p> <p>A new book by two political scientists argues yes to all three questions, making the case<strong> </strong>that the aggressive policies that the US and other countries adopted to fight Covid – including school shutdowns, business closures, mask mandates and social distancing – were in some cases misguided and in many cases deserved more rigorous public debate.</p> <p>In their peer-reviewed <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691267135/in-covids-wake?srsltid=AfmBOoopaXYBoFaN7vkJJJs4dhGEE5V5A72kVtB6tc922n18MduioePN">book</a>, In Covid’s Wake: How Our Politics Failed Us, Stephen Macedo and Frances Lee argue that public health authorities, the mainstream media, and progressive elites often pushed pandemic measures without weighing their costs and benefits, and ostracized people who expressed good-faith disagreement.</p>    <p>“Policy learning seemed to be short-circuited during the pandemic,” Lee said. “It became so moralized, like: ‘We’re not interested in looking at how other people are [responding to the pandemic], because only bad people would do it a different way from the way we’re doing’.”</p> <p>She and Macedo spoke to the Guardian by video call. The Princeton University professors both consider themselves left-leaning, and the book grew out of research Macedo was doing on the ways progressive discourse gets handicapped by a refusal to engage with conservative or outside arguments. “Covid is an amazing case study in groupthink and the effects of partisan bias,” he said.</p> <p>Many Covid stances presented as public health consensus were not as grounded in empirical evidence as many Americans may have believed, Macedo and Lee argue. At times, scientific and health authorities acted less like neutral experts and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/covid-pandemic-lab-leak.html">more like</a> self-interested actors, engaging in PR efforts to downplay uncertainty, missteps or conflicts of interest.</p> <p>It’s a controversial argument. Covid-19 killed more than a million Americans, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_deaths-total">according</a> to US government estimates. The early days of the pandemic left hospitals overwhelmed, morgues overflowing, and scientists scrambling to understand the new disease and how to contain it.</p> <p>Still, Macedo and Lee say, it is unclear why shutdowns and closures went on so long, particularly in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democratic</a> states. The book argues that in the US the pandemic became more politically polarized over time, after, initially, “only modest policy differences between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republican</a>- and Democratic-leaning states”.</p> <p>After April 2020, however, red and blue America diverged. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> contributed to that polarization by <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/21/837348551/timeline-what-trump-has-said-and-done-about-the-coronavirus">downplaying</a> the severity of the virus. Significant policy differences also emerged. Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, moved to re-open physical schools quickly, which progressives characterized as irresponsible.</p> <p>Yet in the end there was “no meaningful difference” in Covid mortality rates between Democratic and Republican states in the pre-vaccine period, according to CDC data cited in the book, despite Republican states’ more lenient policies. Macedo and Lee also favorably compare Sweden, which controversially avoided mass lockdowns but <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/34/4/737/7675929">ultimately</a> had a lower mortality rate than many other European countries.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Covid is an amazing case study in groupthink and the effects of partisan bias</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The shutdowns had foreseeable and quantifiable costs, they say, many of which we are still paying. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/briefing/covid-learning-losses.html">Learning loss</a> and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/parents-are-not-fully-aware-of-or-concerned-about-their-childrens-school-attendance/">school absenteeism</a> soared. Inflation went through the roof thanks in part to lockdown spending and stimulus payments. Small businesses defaulted; other medical treatments like cancer screenings and <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide">mental health care</a> suffered; and rates of loneliness and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/upshot/murder-decline-pandemic-cities.html">crime</a> increased. The economic strain on poor and minority Americans was particularly severe.</p> <p>Covid policies escalated into culture wars, amplifying tensions around other social issues. Teachers’ unions, which are often bastions of Democratic support, painted school re-openings as “rooted in sexism, racism, and misogyny” and “a recipe for … structural racism”, the book notes, despite the fact that minority and poor students were most <a href="https://jsri.msu.edu/publications/nexo/vol-xxiv/no-2-spring-2021/racial-ethnic-differences-in-education-disruptions-during-the-covid-19-pandemic">disadvantaged</a> by remote learning.</p> <p>These measures also had a literal price. “In inflation-adjusted terms,” Macedo and Lee write, “the United States spent more on pandemic aid in 2020 than it spent on the 2009 stimulus package and the New Deal combined” – or about what the US spent on war production in 1943.</p>    <p>Yet of the $5tn that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress">US Congress</a> authorized in 2020 and 2021 for Covid expenditure, only about 10% went to direct medical expenses such as hospitals or vaccine distribution, according to the book; most of the spending was on<strong> </strong>economic relief to people and businesses affected by shutdowns. Ten per cent of that relief was <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/2023/the-great-grift/">stolen</a> by fraud, according to the AP.</p> <p>The pandemic was an emergency with no modern precedent, of course, and hindsight is easy. But In Covid’s Wake tries to take into account what information was known at the time – including earlier pandemic preparedness studies. Reports by <a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/sites/default/files/2023-02/190918-gmpbreport-respiratorypathogen.pdf">Johns Hopkins</a> (2019), the <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf?sequence=1">World Health Organization</a> (2019), <a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idph/files/publications/illinois-pandemic-flu-plan-050316.pdf">the state of Illinois</a> (2014) and the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7c4767e5274a2041cf2ee3/dh_131040.pdf">British government</a> (2011) had all expressed ambivalence or caution about the kind of quarantine measures that were soon taken.</p> <p>“We take a look at the state of the evidence as it was in early 2020,” Lee said. “It was clear at the time that the evidence was quite unsettled around all of this, and if policymakers had been more honest with the public about these uncertainties, I think they would have maintained public trust better.”</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>They wanted there to be an answer – that if we do X and Y, we can prevent this disaster. And so they’re kind of grasping at straws</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security hosted a wargaming exercise in October 2019, shortly before the pandemic began, to simulate a deadly <a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/tabletop-exercises/event-201-pandemic-tabletop-exercise#scenario">coronavirus</a> pandemic; the <a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/200117-publicprivatepandemiccalltoaction.pdf">findings</a> explicitly urged that “[t]ravel and trade … be maintained even in the face of a pandemic”. Similarly, a WHO paper in 2019 said that some measures – such as border closures and contact tracing – were “not recommended in any circumstances”.</p> <p>“And yet we did all of that in short order,” Macedo said, “and without people referring back to these plans.”</p> <p>He and Lee also believe there was a strong element of class bias, with a left-leaning “laptop class” that could easily work from home touting anti-Covid measures that were much easier for some Americans to adopt than others. Many relatively affluent Americans became even <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-income-wealth-surged-pandemic-federal-reserve/">wealthier</a> during the pandemic, in part due to rising housing values.</p> <p>At the same time, the laptop class was only able to socially isolate at home in part because other people risked exposure to provide groceries. Stay-at-home measures were partly intended to protect “essential workers”, but policymakers living in crisis-stricken major metropolitan areas such as New York or Washington DC did not reckon with why social distancing and other measures might be less important in rural parts of the country where Covid rates were lower.</p> <p>Lockdowns were intended to slow Covid’s spread, yet previous pandemic recommendations had suggested they only be used very early in an outbreak and even then do not buy much time, Macedo said. </p>    <p>Policymakers and experts often embraced stringent measures for reasons that are more political than medical, Macedo and Lee argue; in a pandemic, authorities are keen to assure anxious publics that they are “in charge” and “doing something”.</p> <p>In strange contrast, policymakers and journalists in the US and elsewhere seemed to take China as a model, the book argues, despite the fact that China is an authoritarian state and had concealed the scale of the outbreak during the crucial early days of the pandemic. Its regime had obvious incentives to mislead foreign observers, and used draconian quarantine measures such as physically welding people into their homes.</p> <p>When the WHO organized a joint China field mission with the Chinese government, in February 2020, non-Chinese researchers found it difficult to converse with their Chinese counterparts away from government handlers. Yet the WHO’s <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/report-of-the-who-china-joint-mission-on-coronavirus-disease-2019-(covid-19)">report</a> was “effusive in its praise” of China’s approach, the book notes.</p> <p>“My view is that there was just a great deal of wishful thinking on the part of technocrats of all kinds,” Lee said. “They wanted there to be an answer – that if we do X and Y, we can prevent this disaster. And so they’re kind of grasping at straws. The Chinese example gave them hope.” She noted that Covid policymakers might have been better served if there had been people <a href="https://x.com/smarterparrot/status/1898883545109508236">assigned</a> to act as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/18/covid-inquiry-hallett-prescribes-red-teams-as-antidote-to-flawed-thinking">devil’s advocates</a> in internal deliberations.</p> <p>Lee and Macedo are not natural scientists or public health professionals, they emphasize, and their book is about failures in public deliberation over Covid-19, rather than a prescription for<strong> </strong>managing pandemics.</p> <p>But they do wade into the debate about Covid-19’s origin, arguing that the “lab leak” hypothesis – that Covid-19 accidentally leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, rather than spontaneously leaping from animals to humans – was unfairly dismissed.</p> <p>The Wuhan Institute studied coronaviruses similar to the one responsible for Covid-19, had a documented history of safety breaches, was located near the outbreak, and is known to have experimented on viruses using <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7128689/">controversial</a> <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/coronavirus-lab-escape-theory.html">“gain-of-function”</a> methods funded by the US, which involve mutating pathogens to see what they might look like in a more advanced or dangerous form.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>If policymakers had been more honest with the public about these uncertainties, I think they would have maintained public trust better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps because Trump had fanned racial paranoia by calling Covid-19 the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates">China virus</a>” and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/america-far-right-coronavirus-outbreak-trump-alex-jones">rightwing influencers</a> were spreading the notion that it had been deliberately engineered and unleashed on the world by China, many scientists, public health experts and <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-medias-lab-leak-fiasco?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=twitter">journalists</a> reacted by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/new-york-times-covid-lab-leak-apoorva-mandavilli/">framing</a> the idea of a lab leak – even an accidental one – as an offensive conspiracy theory. Dr Anthony Fauci and other top public health figures were evasive or in some cases dishonest about the possibility of a lab leak, Macedo and Lee say, as well as the fact that a US non-profit funded by the National Institutes of Health allegedly <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/09/09/covid-origins-gain-of-function-research/">funded</a> gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute.</p> <p>Since then, though, the CIA and other US intelligence agencies have cautiously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/26/cia-now-backs-lab-leak-theory-to-explain-origins-of-covid-19">endorsed</a> the lab leak theory, and the discourse around Covid has softened somewhat. The economist Emily Oster sparked immense backlash by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/schools-arent-superspreaders/616669/">arguing</a> against school closures in 2020. Now publications such as New York Magazine and the New York Times have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html">acknowledged</a> the plausibility of the lab leak hypothesis, for example, and there is growing consensus that school closures hurt many children.</p> <p>The reception to In Covid’s Wake has been <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-coronavirus-consensus-was-wrong">more</a> <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/09/opinion/covid-five-year-anniversary-2020-mistakes/">positive</a> than Macedo and Lee expected – perhaps a sign that some of their arguments have penetrated the mainstream, if not that we’ve gotten better as a society at talking about difficult things. “The reception of the book has been much less controversial [and] contentious than we expected,” Macedo said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/19/disposable-book-sarah-p-jones">Disposable: what Covid-19 did to those who couldn’t afford to fight the virus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the wounds fester and debates continue. Some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/podcasts/the-daily/were-the-covid-lockdowns-worth-it.html#commentsContainer">readers</a> of the New York Times were furious when The Daily, the newspaper’s flagship podcast, recently interviewed them, with subscribers arguing that the episode was not sufficiently critical of their stance. And some coverage of the book has <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/laptopclassbook/">criticized</a> it for underplaying the danger of the disease.</p> <p>Macedo and Lee said that a few of their colleagues have expressed concern that their critique could fuel political attacks on science – a worry that crossed their minds too. “Our response is that the best way to refute criticisms that science and universities have been politicized is to be open to criticism and willing to engage in self-criticism,” Macedo said.</p> <p>“We need to make sure these institutions are in the best possible working order to face the challenges ahead. And we think that’s by being honest, not by covering over mistakes or being unwilling to face up to hard questions.”</p>
