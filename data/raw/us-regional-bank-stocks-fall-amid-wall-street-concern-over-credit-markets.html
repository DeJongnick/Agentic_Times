<p>US regional banking stocks fell sharply on Thursday after two banks disclosed issues with bad and fraudulent loans, amplifying concerns on Wall Street around the state of credit markets.</p> <p>Zions Bancorp <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/zions-western-alliance-disclose-bad-loans-tied-to-alleged-fraud">announced</a> it had a $50m charge-off over two bad loans from its subsidiary, California Bank &amp; Trust in San Diego. Western Alliance also said it was dealing with a fraudulent borrower.</p> <p>Zions stock was down over 11% by Thursday afternoon, while Western Alliance was down over 10%. Shares of Jefferies Financial Group were down 9% for the day.</p> <p>The sell-off knocked the wider market, with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 down 0.7% and the Dow Jones down 0.6% in New York.</p> <p>The regional banking industry has been under scrutiny after First Brands, an auto parts supplier, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/10/first-brands-wall-street">filed</a> for chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September over creditor concerns.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/10/first-brands-wall-street">First Brands: why a maker of spark plugs and wiper blades has Wall Street worried</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In its bankruptcy filing, First Brands disclosed that it had at least $10bn to $50bn in liabilities against $1bn to $10bn in assets, the product of what appeared to be risky off-balance-sheet financing.</p> <p>Amid the bankruptcy, First Brands’ creditors filed an emergency court filing saying that $2.3bn of the company’s assets had “simply vanished”.</p> <p>Prosecutors at the justice department said they were <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/federal-prosecutors-are-looking-into-first-brands-collapse">investigating</a> the bankruptcy, and regional banks have faced intense scrutiny in light of what some worry were questionable lending practices.</p> <p>Jefferies, a regional bank, and UBS said they had hundreds of millions of dollars in exposure to First Brands. Shares in Jefferies have fallen 25% over the past month.</p> <p>In the aftermath, some experts have pointed out the bankruptcy shows cracks in the system that allows for “shadow banking” – when a borrower turns to private services outside the traditional banking system to get financing. In the case with First Brands, the company gave lenders unpaid invoices as a form of collateral.</p> <p>On a call with analysts on Tuesday, JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/14/jp-morgan-jamie-dimon-losses-private-credit-sector">said</a> his “antenna goes up when things like that happen”.</p> <p>“I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” he said. “Everyone should be forewarned on this.”</p>
