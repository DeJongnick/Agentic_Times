<p>Regarding your article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/16/energy-bills-for-uk-new-build-homes-higher-due-to-poor-construction-standards-analysis-shows">Poor building standards add £1,000 to energy bills of new homes, analysis finds, 16 May</a>), the solution is very simple: the government should adopt the <a href="https://www.passivhaustrust.org.uk/what_is_passivhaus.php">Passivhaus</a> standard that has been established in Germany for over 25 years.</p> <p>Its use there results in buildings with little or no heating requirements as the buildings are super-insulated and extremely airtight, and have mechanical ventilation and heat reclaim systems to distribute filtered air throughout the property.</p> <p>This can obviate the need for solar panels and heat pumps, which&nbsp;have a lifespan of around 25&nbsp;years. However, housebuilders in the UK do not yet have the desire to build houses this way as it requires site staff be motivated to build in a way that prevents air leakage and to care about build quality, something&nbsp;that is sorely lacking here. </p> <p>The higher build cost for the fabric would be offset by the absence or reduction in the cost of heating installation. We have yet to&nbsp;see how the future homes standard will compare, but I for one&nbsp;am not holding my breath.<br><strong>Adrian Birch</strong><br><em>Brockweir, Gloucestershire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
