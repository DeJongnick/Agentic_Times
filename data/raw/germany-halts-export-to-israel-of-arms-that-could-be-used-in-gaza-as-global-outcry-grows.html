<h1>Germany halts export to Israel of arms that could be used in Gaza as global outcry grows</h1>

<p>The German chancellor has indicated a significant shift in Berlin’s staunch support for Israel by stopping the export of military equipment that could be used in Gaza, as international partners condemned Israeli plans to take control of Gaza City.</p> 
<p>Friedrich Merz issued a sharply worded statement signalling the reversal after several weeks of openly criticising Israel’s “unclear” policy goals in Gaza and the unfolding humanitarian disaster there but stopping short of concrete consequences in policy.</p> 
<p>The German leader said Israel had the right to defend itself against Hamas and press for the release of Israeli hostages, which he stressed was Berlin’s “highest priority” along with “resolute negotiations on a ceasefire”.</p> 
<p>However, Merz said his government “believes that the even tougher military action in Gaza Strip decided on by the Israeli cabinet last night makes it increasingly difficult to see how these goals can be achieved. Under these circumstances the German government will until further notice not approve any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip.”</p>

<p>Merz said his administration was “deeply worried about the continued suffering of the civilian population” in Gaza, adding: “With the planned offensive, the Israeli government bears even stronger responsibility than to date for their provisions.”</p> 
<p>Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, criticised the move, claiming Germany was “rewarding Hamas terrorism by embargoing arms to Israel”.</p> 
<p>Germany’s announcement joined a chorus of condemnation from international leaders on Friday over Israel’s plans to expand its military offensive in Gaza.</p> 
<p>The UN secretary general, António Guterres, described the plan as a “dangerous escalation” and said it risked “deepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians”.</p> 
<p>The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called on Israel to back away from its plans, while the European Council president, António Costa, warned that the new offensive would have “consequences” for EU-Israel ties.</p> 
<p>“The Israeli government’s decision to further extend its military operation in Gaza must be reconsidered,” von der Leyen said on social media. “At the same time, there must be the release of all hostages, who are being held in inhumane conditions. And humanitarian aid must be given immediate and unhindered access to Gaza to deliver what is urgently needed on the ground. A ceasefire is needed now.” </p> 
<p>Costa, who heads the body representing the 27 EU states, said a new offensive would only further worsen conditions in Gaza. “Such a decision must have consequences for EU-Israel relations, to be assessed by the council,” he wrote on X.</p> 
<p>Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, denounced the Israeli decision, saying it would “only cause more destruction and suffering”.</p> 
<p>The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/08/israel-wrong-to-escalate-offensive-gaza-city-takeover-plan-keir-starmer">said Israel’s decision was wrong</a> and urged it to immediately reconsider. “This action will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the release of the hostages. It will only bring more bloodshed,” he said.</p> 
<p>The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Israel’s plan “must be immediately halted”, and Turkey urged the international community “to prevent the implementation of this decision”.</p> 
<p>After the devastating Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, Germany strongly boosted its arms exports to Israel. Its parliament said in June that export licences for military equipment to Israel worth €485m were granted between 7 October 2023 and 13 May 2025.</p> 
<p>Germany has for decades maintained an unwavering security relationship with Israel and describes its defence as critical to its own <em>Staatsräson – </em>core to its national identity due to its responsibility for the Holocaust.</p> 
<p>This robust support meant Germany declined to back recent calls within the EU to impose sanctions on Israel for mass civilian deaths in Gaza, such as suspending an association agreement with highly favourable trade terms or shutting it out of big funding and exchange programmes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/european-commission-israel-horizon-europe">such as Horizon</a> and Erasmus.</p> 
<p>The EU has faced criticism for not taking action against Israel in the face of starvation and blockades of utilities and aid but has been bedevilled by splits within the bloc, with Germany, Hungary and Austria prioritising the support of Israel’s right to defend itself.</p>

<p>In his statement on Friday, Merz reiterated that Israel must allow “full-scale access for aid deliveries, including UN organisations and other non-governmental institutions”, so as to “continue to fully and sustainably improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza”.</p> 
<p>He said Germany “urgently asks the Israeli government to undertake no further steps toward an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/24/israeli-far-right-minister-bezalel-smotrich-annex-west-bank">annexation of the West Bank</a>”.</p> 
<p>Public opinion in Germany has grown increasingly critical of Israel as horrific images of starving children and widespread civilian casualties emerge from Gaza. A poll in late July by the Forsa opinion research institute found that <a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2025-07/umfrage-drei-viertel-der-deutschen-fordern-mehr-druck-auf-israel">nearly three-quarters</a> of respondents believed Berlin should apply more pressure on the Israeli government over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.</p> 
<p>While support for this stance was strongest from the far-left Linke (94%) and Greens (88%), most voters for the governing parties, Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD), shared the view, with 77% each.</p> 
<p>Adis Ahmetović, the foreign policy spokesperson of the SPD’s parliamentary group, welcomed Merz’s announcement on Friday but told Der Spiegel that the suspension of arms deliveries “can only be one step – more need to follow”, including a possible suspension of Israel’s trade status with the EU.</p>
