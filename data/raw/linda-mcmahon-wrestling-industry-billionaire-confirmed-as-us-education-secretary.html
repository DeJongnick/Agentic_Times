<p>The US Senate has confirmed Linda McMahon as the nation’s next education secretary, entrusting the former wrestling executive with a department marked for dismantling by Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>The 76-year-old billionaire businesswoman and longtime Trump ally was approved 51-45, reflecting deep divisions over her qualifications and the administration’s education agenda. McMahon, who previously led the Small Business Administration during Trump’s first term, now faces the paradoxical task of running an agency while simultaneously working toward its potential elimination.</p> 
<p>McMahon’s ascension comes amid reports that Trump is preparing an executive order instructing her to slash the department’s operations to the legal minimum while pushing Congress for its complete closure. During the confirmation process, she explicitly endorsed this vision, saying in her opening statement that she “wholeheartedly” supports Trump’s mission to “return education to the states, where it belongs”.</p>

<p>Critics have questioned McMahon’s qualifications, pointing to her limited educational background – a one-year stint on Connecticut’s state board of education and service as a trustee at Sacred Heart University – and lack of traditional experience in education policy or administration.</p>

<p>But the incoming education secretary currently chairs the <a href="https://americafirstpolicy.com/team">America First Policy Institute</a>, a Trump-aligned thinktank home to many of the education department’s <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-announces-incoming-trump-vance-senior-appointees">nominees for senior-level positions</a> – an indication that McMahon will have ideological allies that will position her to implement sweeping changes with minimal internal resistance.</p> 
<p>At her confirmation hearing, McMahon attempted to soften the administration’s hardline stances, promising to maintain critical programs like Title I funding and Pell grants while acknowledging that only Congress holds the authority to eliminate the department entirely.</p> 
<p>The new education secretary takes office as schools and colleges nationwide scrambled to meet <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-dei-schools-dear-colleague-6cca8440afa62689991d373cc4903a4c">a 28 February deadline</a> to eliminate diversity programs or risk losing federal funding. A guidance document from the education department <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-releases-frequently-asked-questions-dear-colleague-letter-about-racial-preferencing">released over the weekend</a> indicates they are not backing down from their strongly held anti-DEI positioning. It also comes days after the department launched a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/trump-administration-dei-reporting-website">DEI reporting portal</a> to catch diversity initiatives in public schools nationwide.</p> 
<p>The education department, created by Congress under former president Jimmy Carter in 1979, distributes billions of dollars annually to K-12 schools and oversees a roughly $1.6tn federal student loan portfolio. Federal funds constitute approximately 14% of public school budgets nationwide.</p> 
<p>Trump’s administration has already begun overhauling the department’s operations, cutting dozens of contracts through Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and gutting the Institute of Education Sciences, which collects data on academic progress.</p>
