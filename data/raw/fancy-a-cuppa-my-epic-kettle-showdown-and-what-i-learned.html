<p>‘Steamy windows!” belted out Tina Turner. I always thought she was singing about an erotic encounter, but now I believe she must have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/22/best-electric-kettles-uk">testing kettles</a>. There’s nothing quite like 12 of them boiling one after the other to fill your kitchen with mist, adding a soft-focus haze to everything in it and making every cold surface slick.</p> <p>Hair-frizzing humidity aside – I spent two days looking as if I had stuck my fingers in a plug socket – the bigger issue at the start was deciding how to test kettles. They all do the same thing in the same way. And they’ve changed little over the decades – a few from the 1970s wouldn’t be out of place in your home today. Beyond a few nice-to-have-but-not-essential features, the kettle remains fundamental and fuss-free.</p> <h2><strong>Infini-tea and beyond</strong></h2> <p>Until now, my contributions to the Filter have been based on tangible results. I tested <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/mar/02/best-air-fryers">air fryers</a>, the colour and crisp of homemade chips allowing me to discern which were good and which less so. Before that, my kitchen hosted a blizzard of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/07/best-blenders">blenders</a> (surely the correct collective noun) – and again, the smoothest smoothies and soups pointed to the appliances with the keenest blades and most powerful motors.</p> <p>For kettles, it was clear that I needed gadgets to work out which were the better boilers of the bunch. And so, armed with a power meter, infrared thermometer, my phone running Decibel X, my husband’s phone as a timer and a probe thermometer, I began heating water. Lots of it. Litre upon litre of it. Enough to make hot drinks for everyone in my street and a few of their friends. And so, little by little, my kitchen became tropical-jungle clammy.</p> <p>However, it’s not just testing that decides which kettle is spout and lid above the others: I also factored in the more tangible aspects, such as build quality – do parts feel flimsy; minimum fills – whether you’ll always need to boil half a litre when 200ml would do; and value for money – the price v what you actually get for it.</p> <h2><strong>Simply the best</strong></h2> <p>Only after all that did I decide which one I thought gave brew for buck: the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bosch-TWK7203GB-Kettle-Cordless-Silver/dp/B088FYWDGX">Bosch Sky kettle</a> (£100). Fast boiling, well designed and insulated to keep water hotter for longer, it’s a good all-rounder that would suit most households. For those hoping to spend less, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kenwood-ZJP06-000BK-Indicator-Protection-removable/dp/B0F2FQLC7S">Kenwood’s Ripple kettle</a> (£32) was my best budget pick, offering style and substance with a low minimum fill, fast boil and choice of colours.</p> <p>Of course, when faced with the news that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/21/tea-in-the-microwave-why-gen-z-are-giving-up-on-kettles-to-make-a-brew">gen Z are bypassing the kettle</a> in favour of the less-efficient microwave, you may wonder why I bothered testing at all. It only seems right to turn again to Tina, the covert product tester. If you’re replacing your kettle, it’s important to know which one is simply the Best.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>This week’s picks</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/06/best-mattress">The best mattresses in 2025: sleep better with our eight rigorously tested picks</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/22/best-sex-toys-accessories-uk">‘The Swiss army knife of sex’: 26 easy ways to spice up your love life</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/24/best-body-moisturiser-lotion-uk">The best body moisturisers: nine favourites for silky smooth, hydrated skin – tested</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/19/best-office-chairs-uk">The best office chairs for all-day comfort and support, tested</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/23/best-supermarket-pitted-green-olives-tasted-rated">‘The texture is perfect – meaty with a fleshy bite’: the best supermarket green olives, tasted and rated</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/21/best-ipl-laser-hair-removal-device-uk">The best IPL and laser hair removal devices for quick and easy grooming at home, tested</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Editor’s pick</h2>    <p>A good <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jul/10/the-best-kitchen-knives-for-every-job-chosen-by-chefs">kitchen knife</a> is an investment.
