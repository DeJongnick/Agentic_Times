<p>A former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/gb-news">GB News</a> presenter is taking legal action against the broadcaster after he was taken off air last year.</p> <p><a href="mailto:albie@carfe.org">Albie Amankona</a>, who co-hosted GB News’s debate programme The Saturday Five, told the Guardian he intended to sue GB News for unfair dismissal and a number of other claims.</p> <p>It comes after Amankona, co-founder of Conservatives Against Racism for Equality, was taken off air after saying on air that he believed the former home secretary Suella Braverman to be a “racist” in July 2024.</p> <p>GB News issued a swift apology to Braverman, stating that the comments “crossed a line between robust debate and causing unnecessary offence”, noting that Braverman was “understandably upset”.</p> <p>Amankona said his claims against GB News include for race discrimination, belief discrimination, victimisation, whistleblowing detriment, unequal pay and unfair dismissal. The broadcaster denies the claims.</p> <p>After initially self-funding the legal action, Amankona is now launching a public crowdfunding campaign with the Good Law Project on Monday.</p> <p>He added that he had made a verbal complaint with a senior manager about what he believed to be racist behaviour by two colleagues in June 2024. He believes no immediate investigative action was taken. GB News denies any racist behaviour occurred.</p> <p>“The only way that I might be able to change the situation is if I stand up for myself and say it is wrong, and use the channels available to me to make my case,” he said.</p> <p>A source at GB News said Amankona was given notice, along with a number of other contributors, two days before his on-air remarks about Braverman.</p> <p>In a statement GB News said: “Mr Amankona’s claim is misconceived, without merit and being robustly defended. As the claim is ongoing we do not propose to comment further.”</p> <p>The source said GB News maintained that its apology to Braverman was appropriate, particularly in light of Louise Casey’s recent report on group-based child sexual abuse and the government’s subsequent decision to call a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.</p> <p>GB News has drawn criticism and praise for its approach to news broadcasting since its launch in June 2021. It has frequently fallen foul of Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, and has been in breach of its rules <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7v3d44zj03o#:~:text=The%20broadcast%20regulator%20has%20found,since%20it%20launched%20in%202021.">12 times</a>.</p> <p>But in March Ofcom dropped 11 investigations or rulings into the breaching of impartiality rules relating to incidents in which politicians read out news items, with most of the cases relating to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/04/gb-news-overtakes-rival-sky-in-latest-live-viewing-figures-data-shows">GB News</a>.</p> <p>The cases were dropped after GB News successfully challenged two Ofcom rulings relating to the former Conservative cabinet minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacob-rees-mogg">Jacob Rees-Mogg</a> over reading updates about news stories. The chief executive of GB News, Angelos Frangopoulos, said Ofcom’s decision to withdraw more cases was “another vindication of GB News editorial decision-making”.</p> <p>Amankona said he had been drawn to the broadcaster’s “fresh approach” on its launch, and its commitment to free speech. “I really felt like I was part of something new, something fresh, exciting, and something being done in a different way. I am a very passionate believer in free speech and more opinions being foregrounded,” he said.</p> <p>The 31-year-old began appearing on GB News in July 2021 and started co-hosting The Saturday Five from March 2023 until his last appearance in August 2024. He said that he had believed strongly in the GB News project, and had been left feeling dismayed by the nature of his departure from the broadcaster.</p> <p>“I’m actually very sad about the situation. I was obviously very sad when it happened, and I’m more sad that we’ve got to a point where I am pursuing legal action against GB News,” he said.</p>
