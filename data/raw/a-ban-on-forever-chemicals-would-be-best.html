<p>The researcher quoted in your disturbing report on Sweden’s Pfas (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) scandal says her work feels like trying to catch a runaway train (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/19/world-worst-case-of-pfas-forever-chemicals-contamination-kallinge">Poison in the water: the town with the world’s worst case of forever chemicals contamination, 19 June</a>).</p> <p>Kallinge is one of a growing list of European towns with extreme levels of Pfas. In fact, there are <a href="https://foreverpollution.eu/map/">tens of thousands</a> of contaminated sites. It is time to slam on the brakes. There is a lot of talk about clean-up technologies and how these might solve the problem. But relying on clean-ups is like bailing out a sinking boat with a teacup while the crew is busy drilling new holes in the hull. Legislation is urgent and essential. Indeed, Europe has a detailed plan to ban all Pfas, and with strict time limits on transitions to safe alternatives.</p> <p>But now Brussels says that, instead, it intends to exclude these chemicals <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/en/2025/05/consumer-pfas-vs-universal-ban">from consumer products only</a>. These account for barely one-fifth of all Pfas emissions, so banning them would only slow the rate at which they accumulate in water, soil and human tissue. Such a partial ban would be a short‑sighted capitulation to commercial interests and a free‑market ideology that opposes&nbsp;all regulation.</p> <p>Even when we halt the Pfas locomotive, we will be cleaning up this mess for decades to come.<br><strong>Jonatan Kleimark</strong><br><em>Head of corporate sustainability, ChemSec (International Chemical Secretariat), Gothenburg, Sweden</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
