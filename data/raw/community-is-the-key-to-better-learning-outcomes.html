<p>Career success often resembles an adventure rather than a straight, predictable path. Pursuing our passions while navigating life’s ups and downs is rarely smooth. A key factor in overcoming obstacles is having support.</p> <p>The career path of Holly Thompson, a supervisor of zoology at Perth Zoo and a Murdoch University alumnus, illustrates the impact that a supportive institution can have. Once a student with average grades, she is now a 2024 <a href="https://www.churchilltrust.com.au/wa/fellow/holly-thompson-wa-2024/" rel="nofollow">Churchill fellow</a>, thanks in part to the opportunities and flexibility provided by Murdoch.</p> <p>“It was instilled in me from a young age to be curious and open to continuous development,” she says. “This attitude has been consistently encouraged through my experiences at Murdoch University.”</p> <h2>A university of difference</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Holly Thompson. <br>Photo supplied.</p></li> </ul> <p>Since opening its doors in 1974, <a href="https://www.murdoch.edu.au/" rel="nofollow">Murdoch University</a> has championed social equity and fostered a community that supports all people as they bid to reach their potential. As the university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Andrew Deeks, puts it: “Murdoch University has been a university of difference since its foundation.”</p> <p>Sustainability, inclusivity, and respect for First Nations perspectives are principles intrinsic to every aspect of Murdoch’s teaching and research. The first Australian university to introduce flexible admissions that considered factors beyond academic results, Murdoch has always had a forward-thinking and optimistic approach to education.</p> <h2>Pathways for ambition</h2> <p>Thompson knows better than most how challenges can be overcome with the right support. She always wanted a career in wildlife conservation, despite initial discouragement. “I didn’t have the best grades in school, but I was fuelled by passion and determination,” she says.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>I didn’t have the best grades in school, but I was fuelled by passion and determination.</p> <footer> <cite>- Holly Thompson </cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite initial setbacks, Thompson’s determination to pursue a career in wildlife conservation led her to Murdoch, where programs such as OnTrack Flex, the near-miss ATAR program OnTrack Sprint, and the nationally acclaimed Indigenous enabling program K-Track provide multiple pathways to entry.</p> <p>Thompson was able to enrol in a bachelor of science in conservation and wildlife biology and has never looked back. “The learning environment provided me with the support I needed,” she says.</p> <p>Shortly after starting her degree, Thompson was confronted with an unexpected challenge: she was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. At the time, she was balancing her studies with a job at Perth Zoo, and it was a setback that could have discouraged someone less determined or been impossible to manage at a less accommodating institution.</p> <p>“Murdoch was exceptionally supportive during this time and assisted with options such as units at other universities and utilising these to complement my degree,” Thompson says.</p> <p>Today, Thompson puts her degree to use as not only a supervisor of zoology at Perth Zoo but a conservationist working to release orangutans back into the wild and end the illegal pet trade of gibbons.</p> <p>It’s a dream career story that came true thanks to Thompson’s ambition and the university’s sustained commitment to student diversity and inclusion.</p> <p>“I encourage everyone to be proactive in their career, and that starts with study choices,” Thompson says.</p> <h2>Diversity in higher education</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Students come together on Bush Court, the heart of Murdoch University’s Perth campus.

Adapting to change and development is an expected part of this process, but with strong institutional support, every student’s unique circumstances are considered to guide them towards fulfilling career outcomes that align with their needs and ambitions.</p> <p>Deeks outlines Murdoch’s commitment. “We are modelling a genuinely inclusive community where everyone can reach their potential,” he says. “The impact of this reverberates far beyond our campuses, as our students go on to forge careers, carrying this experience and an appreciation of the value of community with them.”</p> <p>Bennett says valuing diversity, equity and inclusion is an investment in the future.</p> <p>“At Murdoch,” she says, “we want to produce graduates and professionals who are empowered with the skills and confidence to instigate and direct positive change in society, industry, environment and, ultimately, our shared future.”</p> <p>Thompson’s journey is proof of the power of that.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://www.murdoch.edu.au/" rel="nofollow">Realise your brightest ambitions at Murdoch University</a>.</strong></p>
