<p>A judge in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michigan">Michigan</a> dismissed the felony charges against a slate of electors who falsely signed on to documents claiming <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> won the 2020 election in the latest blow to efforts to hold the president and his allies accountable for attempting to overturn the results of the White House race he lost to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/23/michigan-false-electors-trump-state-republicans">Sixteen people</a> were initially charged with eight felonies each related to forgery and conspiracy by the Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel, in 2023, though one of them had his charges dropped after he agreed to cooperate with the prosecution. The fake electors in Michigan will not go to trial.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/14/trump-fake-elector-scheme-cases">14 of Trump’s fake electors are now real: where do the state investigations stand?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>District court judge Kristen Simmons decided that the state had not provided “evidence sufficient to prove intent”, a requirement for fraud cases. She told a courtroom on Tuesday that the case did not involve the intent of those who orchestrated the scheme, like Kenneth Chesebro and other Trump attorneys – but those who actually signed the documents, Votebeat <a href="https://www.votebeat.org/michigan/2025/09/09/false-electors-charges-dropped-kristen-simmons/">reported</a>.</p> <p>“I believe they were executing their constitutional right to seek redress,” Simmons said of those who signed the documents.</p> <p>Nessel spoke against the decision in a press conference after, according to <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/briefs/judge-alleged-michigan-republican-false-electors-will-not-face-trial/">Michigan Advance</a>. “The evidence was clear,” she said. “They lied. They knew they lied, and they tried to steal the votes of millions of Michiganders. And if they can get away with this, well, what can’t they get away with next?”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Trump</a> supporters in seven swing states signed on as fake electors in the scheme. Some of the fake electors – and, in some cases, those who orchestrated the scheme – were charged for state crimes in five of those states.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/DNBethLeBlanc/status/1965396689281232923">Protesters</a> outside the courtroom called the case an example of “lawfare” and a “hoax”. After the judge’s comments, those charged and their supporters celebrated the decision and called for consequences against Nessel for bringing the case.</p> <p>An attorney for the former Michigan Republican party co-chairperson Meshawn Maddock said the case was a “malicious prosecution” and that “there needs to be major consequences for the people who brought this,” according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/michigan-fake-electors-donald-trump-2020-60022827cd726924b19a7b152bbe27b1">Associated Press</a>.</p> <p>Some of those who signed on as fake electors in 2020 went on to be real presidential electors for Trump in the 2024 election, when he defeated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a> to return to the Oval Office beginning in January.</p>
