<p>Black women in the UK who experience symptoms caused by fibroids are facing delays, poor care and dismissal by healthcare professionals according to a parliamentary report.</p> <p>Published by the all-party parliamentary group on black health, the <a href="https://www.cahn.org.uk/fibroidsreport/">report included a survey</a> of more than 500 women regarding their experience of uterine fibroids, with more than 70% of respondents being Black British.</p> <p>The survey found that more than a quarter (27%) of respondents were not offered any treatment after being diagnosed with fibroids, and more than 50% also had experienced delays to their diagnosis of at least two years, while 26% of respondents had lived with fibroids for more than 10 years.</p> <p>Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths that develop in or around the womb. Serious cases can be linked to very heavy or long menstrual periods, pain, pelvic pressure and infertility and an increased risk of miscarriage. Previous reports have suggested that black and Asian women may have an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/10/one-in-four-women-england-reproductive-health-issue-survey">increased risk of experiencing more serious cases of fibroids</a>.</p> <p>The report also found there to be a lack of dedicated research to uterine fibroids in general in the UK, finding that between 2014 and 2021 there have been only six UK-based research studies on the issue.</p> <p>“Fibroids are a reproductive health emergency that disproportionately affect black women, and are the leading cause of reproductive complications such as disrupted fertility journeys, pregnancy loss and surgical interventions,” said Prof Faye Ruddock, the chair of the Caribbean and African Health Network.</p> <p>She added: “Many women experience delayed diagnosis, delays and dismissal that can cause unhealthy psychological and emotional burdens. The all-party parliamentary group on black health’s focus on fibroids was shaped by two years of advocacy led by the Caribbean &amp; African Health Network and other black-led organisations.</p> <p>“There is a great need for research on genetics and lived experiences. This report demands systemic change to improve government policy, healthcare practice, access and outcomes for black women.”</p> <p>The report, supported by the Health Foundation, also found that black women were disproportionately offered hysterectomies as a first-line treatment after a delayed diagnosis, and that non-surgical options including a myomectomy were still underutilised and not highlighted as an alternative treatment option.</p> <p>Prof Ranee Thakar, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “Fibroids affect around two in three women during their lifetime, most commonly between the ages of 30 and 50. This report rightly highlights the disproportionate impact on black women.</p> <p>“The consequences of fibroids can be profound, causing pain, heavy bleeding, and in some cases, reduced fertility, all of which can deeply affect a woman’s quality of life.</p> <p>She added: “These health inequities must be addressed urgently and we are working with clinical experts and women to develop recommendations for improved screening, diagnosis and the treatment of fibroids in England. With over half a million women still waiting for gynaecological care for conditions such as fibroid treatment, timely detection and intervention are critical.”</p> <p>Paulette Hamilton, the MP for Birmingham Erdington and chair of the all party group on black health, said: “For too long, black women have suffered in silence with fibroids, their pain dismissed and their care delayed. This report breaks that silence. It is a call to action for equity, dignity, and justice in women’s health, and it must become a clear and measurable priority within our national health strategy.”</p> <p>A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said:<strong> </strong>“Women with uterine fibroids are waiting too long for diagnosis and care, especially Black women – that’s unacceptable. We are determined to end years of neglect in women’s health by placing equality at the heart of our reforms. This means listening to women and delivering the high-quality care they deserve.</p> <p>“We are also funding new research to improve outcomes for women with uterine fibroids and our drive to cut waiting lists will benefit all patients, including those with gynaecological conditions.”</p>
