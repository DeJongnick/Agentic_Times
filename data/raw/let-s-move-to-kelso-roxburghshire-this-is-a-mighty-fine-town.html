<p><strong>What’s going for it?</strong> I’m a sucker for a bit of Romanesque architecture. Even the prospect of a half-ruined tower and a crumbled jamb is enough to drag me several score miles off my beaten track. I’m easily distracted. And so I come to Kelso. Like those in its neighbouring border market towns, <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/kelso-abbey/">Kelso’s abbey</a> is a shadow of its 12th-century self, when it was the richest, mightiest monastery in the region. But even the fragments left behind still define the town, though the abbey has competition these days. This is a mighty fine town, a lovely little place squished where the rivers Tweed and Teviot say how d’you do. Every street is an architectural delight. The town hall has grand columns leaping over the cobbles on the Square. And the town has not one but two stately homes in tow. If you think <a href="http://www.mellerstain.com/">Mellerstain House</a> is fancy-pantsy, have a gawp at vast <a href="https://www.floorscastle.com/visit-us/">Floors Castle</a>, possibly the turrety-est stately home in the nation, and definitely not a castle. Those battlements couldn’t withstand the big bad wolf, let alone marauding Northumbrians across the border.</p> <p><strong>The case against</strong> Not cheap for hereabouts.</p> <p><strong>Well connected?</strong> No trains, but there are several daily buses to Berwick-upon-Tweed (one hour) and Jedburgh and Hawick, plus a few to Edinburgh (two hours). Driving: half an hour to neighbours such as Melrose, Galashiels and Coldstream, 40 mins to the coast and Berwick, and more than an hour (depending on traffic) to central Edinburgh.</p> <p><strong>Schools </strong>Primaries: quality indicators for <a href="http://edenside.scotborders.sch.uk">Edenside</a> and <a href="http://sprouston.scotborders.sch.uk">Sprouston</a> are “good”; for <a href="http://broomlandsprimary.co.uk/home/4593724922">Broomlands</a> mostly “good”, Education Scotland says. Secondaries: those for <a href="http://kelsohighschool.org.uk">Kelso High</a> are “good” or “very good”.</p> <p><strong>Hang out at…</strong> There’s just one place you need to know about: <a href="http://www.thecobbleskelso.co.uk/">the Cobbles</a>. If you can squeeze in.</p> <p><strong>Where to buy</strong> The town’s lovely old stone farmhouses or manses attract the highest prices. In town you can’t put a foot wrong for fine stone town houses and terraces, or little cottages tucked down alleys. Some nice views over the river: check out Roxburgh Street heading to Floors Castle. Lovely stone or white render/whitewash. The usual assortment of suburbs and cul-de-sacs. Large detacheds and town houses, £350,000-£600,000. Detacheds and smaller town houses, £175,000-£350,000. Semis, £120,000-£300,000. Terraces and cottages, £100,000-£180,000. Rentals – not much: a one-bed flat, £375pcm; a three-bed house, £450-£500pcm.</p> <p><strong>Bargain of the week</strong> A two-bed Victorian terrace, needing a bit of modernisation, yours for £99,995, <a href="https://www.purplebricks.co.uk/property-for-sale/2-bedroom-terraced-house-kelso-135373/#">purplebricks.co.uk</a>.</p> <h2>From the streets</h2> <p><strong>Sharon Dalziel </strong>“Fine views of the river Tweed from Rennie Bridge; good local walks past <a href="http://places.discovertheborders.co.uk/places/24.html">Junction Pool</a> (one of the best for salmon fishing).”</p> <p><strong>Tony Reed</strong> “Kelso belies its size with a showground, rugby, cricket, tennis, bowls and curling venues. Interesting independent shops set along cobbled streets; the <a href="https://www.thecontentedvine.com/">Contented Vine</a> for sublime food.”</p> <p>• Do you live in Kelso?
