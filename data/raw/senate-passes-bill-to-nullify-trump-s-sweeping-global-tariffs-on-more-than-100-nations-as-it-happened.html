He’s gone into quite a bit of detail about the meeting’s outcomes, saying it was a 12 out of 10. Trump said the meeting was “amazing”, with “an outstanding group of decisions made”.</p> <p>“We’ve come to a conclusion on many important points,” he said.</p> <p>Noting that we do not yet have anything from the Chinese side on their interpretation of events, here are some key takeaways from what Trump has said:</p> <h2>Visits</h2> <p>The US president told reporters he would go to China in April and that Xi “will be coming here some time after that. Whether it’s in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington DC”.</p> <h2>Rare earths</h2> <p>Trump said China has agreed on a one-year deal to supply rare earths, after its shock announcement that it was banning exports if there was any chance of the products having dual use for foreign militaries or some semiconductor sectors. But Trump said Xi said “they’re gonna keep those flowing”. He expected the one-year deal to be extended.</p> <p>Trump said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>All of the rare earth has been settled. That roadblock is gone now, there’s no roadblock at all on rare earths.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Tariffs</h2> <p>Trump said Xi was going to “work very hard to stop the flow” of precursor chemicals that the US said are being used to make fentanyl. The US had put a 20% tariff on Chinese products specifically to pressure Beijing over fentanyl. Today Trump says he’s reduced it to 10%, lowering the overall tariff burden from 57% to 47%.</p> <h2>Chips</h2> <p>Trump said he and Xi discussed China buying chips from Nvidia, but that US was more of an “arbitrator or referee” between them. When asked if he was going to allow Nvidia’s new Blackwell AI chip to be sold to China, Trump said: “We’re not talking about the Blackwell ... But a lot of chips, you know, a lot of the chips. And that’s good for us”.</p> <h2>Ukraine and Taiwan</h2> <p>The war in Ukraine, sparked by Russia’s 2022 invasion, “did come up”, Trump said, saying the US and China are going to work together on it to stop people being killed.</p> <p>However, he also said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The two sides are locked in fighting, and sometimes you’ve got to let them fight I guess. Crazy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Taiwan, which China is threatening to annex militarily, “never came up”, Trump said on Air Force One. “That was not discussed actually.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-30T05:52:08.724Z">at 5.52am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6902f4e08f08358f328d3c6d" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-30T05:18:10.328Z">5.18am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>One topic that was not discussed in his talks with Xi was Taiwan, Trump said. </p> <p>Earlier, both leaders ignored a question about the self-governing democracy, amid concern in Taipei that Trump may be willing to make concessions to Xi, who has vowed to “reunify” it with the mainland.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6902f1678f0828c07236c8ba" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-30T05:13:39.984Z">5.13am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump says China to resume buying US soybeans and keep exporting rare earths</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> has said a deal he struck to reduce tariffs on China involves Beijing in return resuming US soybean purchases, keeping rare earths exports flowing and cracking down on the illicit trade of fentanyl.</p> <p>Trump also said after his meeting with <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> that it had been a “great success” and and he would visit China in April for new talks.</p> <p>The US president repeatedly talked up the prospect of reaching an agreement with Xi since US negotiators on Sunday said they had agreed on a framework with China that would avoid 100% US tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China’s export curbs on rare earths, a sector it dominates.</p> <p>Chinese stocks climbed to a decade high and the yuan currency to a near one-year peak against the dollar as investors hoped for an easing of trade tensions that have upended supply chains and rocked global business confidence.</p> <p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One about the leaders’ coming visits:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’ll be going to China in April and he’ll be coming here sometime after that, whether it’s in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington DC.</p> </blockquote> <p>“A lot of things we brought to finalisation” at Thursday’s talks in Busan, Trump added.<br><em>With agencies</em></p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-30T05:24:00.853Z">at 5.24am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6902f06b8f0860207cef10d7" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/helen-davidson"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-30T05:01:15.345Z">5.01am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Continued from last post:</em></p> <p>Like today with Nvidia’s AI chips, there were also issues around tech and security.

All three were later released in an apparent deal, more than two years later.</p> <p>There’s not yet been full details of how today’s meeting went, but Chinese state media reported earlier: “During the meeting, Trump said that the US and China have reached many consensus and will reach even more, saying: ‘I believe we will build a long-term, good relationship’.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-30T05:01:58.356Z">at 5.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6902eb578f08358f328d3c28" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/helen-davidson"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-30T04:58:12.544Z">4.58am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Key event</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The last time Xi and Trump met was in June 2019, during Trump’s first term. Looking back at it feels ... familiar.</p> <p>The meeting was in Osaka, on the sidelines of the G20, and just months after trade talks (during the first Trump-China trade war) had broken down. The US had accused China of reneging on trade promises, and Trump raised tariffs from 10% to 20% on about $200bn of Chinese imports. China had hit back with its own tariffs.</p> <p>Today, a mishmash of overlapping industry and punishment specific tariffs are on average far higher, and the US is threatening 100% tariffs if China doesn’t back down from its ban on some rare earth sales.</p> <p>But in 2019 the meeting appeared to help, with Trump declaring things to be “right back on track”. He praised Xi as a great leader, and Xi noted there had been disagreements but that it was important the relationship remain strong.</p> <p>Both sides said they would not impose further tariffs and that the world’s two biggest economies would restart negotiations on a trade deal. He said China would soon be buying “a tremendous amount of food and agricultural product”, again in parallel with today’s meeting as Trump sought to have China restart its US soybean purchases.</p> <p><em>Continued next post</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6902ef418f08358f328d3c53" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-30T04:53:57.683Z">4.53am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> also said aboard Air Force One after the meeting that the US and China would “work together” on the Ukraine war.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6902ed278f0860207cef10c6" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-30T04:44:26.167Z">4.44am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump says rare earths issue settled</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Trump also said the rare earths issue has been settled and there would be no more roadblocks on them.</p> <p>Speaking aboard Air Force One, the US president was also reported as saying it was a one-year agreement that would be extended.</p> <p>Trump also said US tariffs on China would be lowered to 47% from 57%.</p> <p>He said he would be going to China in April and that Xi would come to the US at some stage after that, in comments carried by Reuters.</p> <p>He also said Taiwan didn’t come up during the meeting.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-30T04:51:59.463Z">at 4.51am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6902ebf18f0828c07236c88d" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-30T04:39:40.641Z">4.39am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> has been reported as saying that his meeting with <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> today was amazing and it was agreed that the Chinese leader would work very hard to stop fentanyl.</p> <p>Trump hinted this week he would reduce US tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for a commitment by Beijing to stem the flow of ingredients needed to make fentanyl, an opioid that is the leading cause of overdose deaths in the US.</p> <p><em>We’ll bring you more comments from Trump as they come in.</em></p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-30T04:41:32.108Z">at 4.41am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6902e69f8f0860207cef109c" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-30T04:22:09.206Z">4.22am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Away from the Busan talks a lot of attention is also on <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s announcement just before the meeting that he has ordered the Pentagon to start nuclear weapons testing at the same level as China and Russia.</p> <p>It came after Russia’s <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> said on Wednesday that Moscow had successfully tested its Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo in defiance of US warnings.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/30/donald-trump-xi-jinping-meeting-live-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6902c0928f0860207cef0fcb#block-6902c0928f0860207cef0fcb">reported earlier</a>, Trump posted on social media less than an hour before meeting Xi that Russia had the second-biggest nuclear arsenal after the US and that China was “a distant third”.</p> <p>The US president’s post said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.

The meeting comes amid hopes that the leaders of the US and China could hammer out a trade deal that would bring a truce in the blistering trade war between the world’s two largest economies which has roiled global markets and sent international supply chains into panic.</p> <p><strong>Negotiators from Beijing and Washington have both confirmed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting">“framework”</a> has been agreed.</strong> It is now down to Trump and Xi, who will meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korean today, to sign off on it.</p> <p>The meeting is set to begin at 11am local time <strong>– in one hour –</strong> in Busan, a port city about 76km (47 miles) south of Gyeongju, the Apec summit’s main venue. News reports a few minutes ago said Xi had left Beijing for South Korea, citing Chinese state media. </p> <p><strong>High on the meeting’s agenda will be rare earths</strong>. China’s chokehold on the supply of the critical minerals – which are vital for US industries ranging from car making to military equipment – has been a powerful bargaining chip for Beijing.</p> <p>China controls about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/china-steps-up-control-rare-earth-exports-national-security-concerns">70% of the world’s rare earths mining</a> and more than 90% of its processing capacity.

Analysts noted that it came soon after the US expanded restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor technology to China.</p> <p>Also up for discussion will be the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/trump-and-xi-talks-what-will-be-on-the-agenda-when-us-president-meets-chinas-leader">Ukraine war and China’s claim on Taiwan</a>, although Trump said on Wednesday: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/trump-xi-talks-rare-earths-tariffs-us-china">“I don’t know that we’ll even speak about Taiwan.”</a></p> <p>The meeting comes after Trump visited Malaysia, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/donald-trump-sanae-takaichi-japan-prime-minister-rare-earths-agreement">Japan</a> and South Korea on his Asia tour, striking a series of deals on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/17/rare-earths-critical-minerals-explained">rare earths</a>.</p> <p>We will be closely following developments in Busan – stay with us.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-30T01:07:20.367Z">at 1.07am GMT</time></p>  </div>
