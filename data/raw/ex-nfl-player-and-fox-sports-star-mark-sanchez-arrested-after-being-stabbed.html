<p>Police have said that former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl">NFL</a> quarterback and Fox Sports television star Mark Sanchez has been arrested at the hospital he was taken to after being stabbed late Friday night in downtown Indianapolis.</p> <p>The Indianapolis metropolitan police department said in a statement that after investigation and consultation with prosecutors, Sanchez, now a television commentator, was arrested “for battery with injury, unlawful entry of a motor vehicle and public intoxication”, all of which are misdemeanors.</p> <p>“Sanchez is still in the hospital and has not been booked into the Adult Detention Center,” the IMPD said.</p> <p>Police were called shortly after midnight to a location near West Washington Street and North Senate Avenue where two people were injured, one of them now identified as Sanchez.</p> <p>Officers with the Indianapolis metropolitan police department responded to what was described as a “disturbance in an alley” about 12.30am Saturday, <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/crime/2-wounded-apparent-stabbing-downtown-indianapolis-west-washington/531-be269237-ec3c-4f42-8c41-f4b2eb27dba9?tbref=hp">WTHR</a> reported. One person had been stabbed, while another sustained separate injuries.</p> <p>Sanchez was taken to a nearby hospital in critical condition, according to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/10/04/mark-sanchez-stabbed-indianapolis-critical-injury/">TMZ Sports</a>. The circumstances surrounding the attack remain unclear. The suspect involved has been detained, according to WTHR.</p> <p>The broadcaster had earlier confirmed he was “recovering in the hospital in stable condition” on Saturday without elaborating on the cause or nature of his injuries or the arrest.</p> <p>“The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office will make the final charging decision,” the statement added, noting that an arrest “is merely an accusation and Sanchez should be considered innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law”.</p> <p>Sanchez, 38, was in Indianapolis before Sunday’s Colts v Raiders matchup at Lucas Oil stadium, which he was set to call for Fox Sports. He joined Fox in 2021 as an NFL broadcaster and also contributes to FS1 studio programming.</p> <p>Before his broadcasting career, Sanchez played 10 seasons in the NFL with several teams, including the New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys. He retired in July 2019 and soon after began working with ESPN’s college football coverage before transitioning to Fox.</p> <p>Off the field, Sanchez married his wife, Perry, in 2023. The couple shares three children.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 4 October 2025 to correct that Mark Sanchez works for Fox Sports, not Fox News.</p>
