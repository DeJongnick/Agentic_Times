But, in a classic example of how political consensus at Westminster does not always overlap with what is seen by experts as wise policy making, Paul Johnson, the director of the <strong>Institute for Fiscal Studies</strong> thinktank, told the PM programme that he did not think today’s announcement was a good one. He said he thought cutting the benefit last year was a “sensible” policy in the first place and that restoring the benefit for most pensioners in this manner was not a sound use of public money. He explained:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It wouldn’t even be in the top 100 of things that I would do with my £1.25bn if I wanted to act on poverty.

A journalist put it him that he kept falling out with colleagues. But Farage claimed this was not true. He replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think the evidence actually is very different. You’ll find the teams that work with me – many of them have been with me for over a decade. One or two that I worked with I worked with for 25 years …</p> <p>I am someone that maintains long-term friendships, and I’ll do that.</p> <p>But if ever anybody talks behind my back, or if anybody betrays that trust, then I’ll never speak to them again. Quite simple, and they should expect the same level of trust back from me.</p> </blockquote> <p>Farage also claimed that problem was caused by people thinking they would make a better leader.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Inevitably, what you get are people who think they’re bigger and better than me, the party will be better off run by somebody else than me. And that’s what leads to the public fallouts because they don’t like the result of it.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Farage said the fallout with Zia Yusuf showed he could resolve disputes with colleagues</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Was I annoyed with Zia on Thursday? I wasn’t exactly chuffed with what he had to say … But, you know what, people make mistakes. And he came back to me and honestly said, ‘Look, I’m really sorry.’ Have I forgiven him? It’s done, it’s behind us, and we move on.</p> </blockquote> <p>Farage also defended Reform UK’s inability to say at this point who its candidate for first minister will be in next year’s Senedd elections. The party does not have a leader in Wales yet. Asked why not, he replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This party is evolving. It is a work in progress. We are building rapidly as we go. Figures will emerge over the course of the next few months, who, through merit, will no doubt be in a position where they can qualify to be our lead member.

In comments that had been well trailed in advance, he said that he wanted <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14792579/Nigel-Farages-steel-industry-Wales.html">to reopen mines</a> and <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/farage-to-pledge-to-reopen-blast-furnaces-in-port-talbot-13380972">reopen the blast furnaces</a> at the Port Talbot steelworks.</p> <p>In his speech he said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Our ambition is to reindustrialise Wales. </p> <p>We are going to be using more steel over the next few years than we probably ever used as we increase military spending and as we attempt a house building programme in Wales, and even more so in England, of massive proportionsj just to catch up with the population explosion over the last 20 years. We are going to need a lot of steel.</p> <p>Our belief is we should be producing our own steel. Our belief is, for what use coal still has, we should produce our own coal …</p> <p>I’m not saying let’s open up all the pits. What I am saying is there’s coal, specific types of coal, for certain uses that we still need in this country, and we certainly will need for the blast furnaces here, that we should produce ourselves rather than importing.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, during the Q&amp;A, a BBC reporter put it to Farage that industry sources saying reopening the blast furnaces at Port Talbot would be impossible. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c87jnndw7nqo">Asked about this,</a> Farage conceded that reopening a blast furnace would be very difficult. A new one might be needed, he said. </p> <p>He replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Once a blast furnace has been closed down, to actually reopen that particular blast furnace is very, very difficult. Nothing’s impossible, but it might be difficult. It might be easier to build a new one. </p> <p>Could a Welsh government, Welsh devolved government, do it on its own? It would need some help from national government too, which is why I phrased all of this this morning very, very carefully into saying, not ‘we will do this once we’re in control in Cardiff’, [but] ‘this will be our ambition, we’d need a Westminster government to approve this as well’. Who knows, that might be us in time. And we’d need to work with companies as well. But, as an ambition, it’s the right one.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, on mining, asked if there was any evidence that Welsh people want their children to go down mines again, given so many miners wanted their sons not to have to do these dangerous jobs, Farage replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If you offer people well-paid jobs, you would be surprised, many will take them, even though we’d all accept that mining is dangerous.</p> </blockquote> <p>As WalesOnline <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage-reform-wales-live-31815273">reports</a>, Welsh Labour have dismissed this as fantasy politics. A <strong>Welsh Labour spokesperson</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Nigel Farage has no plans for steel - just a camera crew. You can’t restart a blast furnace with a press conference.</p> <p>Nigel Farage says that hopefully they mightthey’ll bring back mining. The people of Wales will see through the false hope and false promises of a public-school boy from England who does not understand them and does not understand Wales.</p> <p>His answer is to bring back the mines. The only thing Nigel Farage is trying to mine is votes from communities that have already gone through tough times. Nigel Farage has today brought his fantasy politics and magic money tree to Port Talbot. He’s gambling with real people’s livelihoods.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-6846d9678f0868a29b800c78" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-09T13:02:01.885Z">2.02pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">New winter fuel payments policy 'only marginally progressive', says Resolution Foundation thinktank</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The <strong>Resolution Foundation</strong>, a thinktank focusing on the interests of low and middle earners, says the new winter fuel payments (WFPs) policy is “only marginally progressive”. In a briefing note it says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>According to DWP caseload data, in 2023-24 around 11.6 million pensioners received WFPs at a cost of around £2.2bn. Last winter (2024-25), around 1.3 million pensioners received WFPs at a cost of around £300 million. Next winter (2025-26), under these plans, around 9 million pensioners will receive WFPs at a cost of around £1.6bn.</p> <p>The new scheme is only marginally progressive, with 57% pensioners gaining from the new policy in the bottom half of the income distribution, and the remaining 43% in the top half.</p> </blockquote> <p>In tax/benefit policy terms, “progressive” means benefiting poorer people more than richer people.</p> <p>Alex Clegg, an economist at the thinktank, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The new scheme for means-testing winter fuel payments means that that the number of pensioners receiving support will rise from 1.3 million last winter to around 9 million this winter, and not far off the 11.6 million who received winter fuel payments two winters ago when they were universal.</p> <p>But this U-turn doesn’t represent a return to the status quo. The new means-test will create new complexity in the tax system, including a cliff-edge for those with around £35,000 of income. The reported savings of £450m will be reduced further by the cost of increased pension credit take-up as a result of the original policy, and the cost of administering the new means-test.</p> <p>The real question is why it is now a priority to pay winter fuel payments to over three quarters of pensioners, with almost half of the new beneficiaries in the richest half of the population, when previously it was judged that only one-in-ten needed support.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6846d76a8f08b83ed04391b0" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-09T12:51:33.262Z">1.51pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Faisal Islam</strong>, the BBC’s economics editor, is also arguing that today’s announcement shows that last year’s winter fuel payments cut could be seen as pointless.

Campaigners have described this as Islamphobic.</p> <p>Last week Pochin asked Starmer at PMQs if he would ban the burqa. Yusuf, who is Muslim, posed a message on X describing that as a “dumb” question, because banning the burqa is not party policy, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/06/labour-victory-hamilton-scotland-reform-conservatives-uk-politics-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-6842b7508f08d8006b37327b#block-6842b7508f08d8006b37327b">a few hours later he resigned</a>, saying he had concluded that he now longer believed “working to get a Reform government elected is a good use of my time”.</p> <p>On Saturday Yusuf announced that he had made a mistake, that he had reconciled with Nigel Farage and that he was returning to a party role – although not as chair.</p> <p>In his first broadcast interview this morning, <strong>Nick Robinson</strong>, the presenter, asked Yusuf about claims that his resignation was partly motivated by his concern about the dominance of anti-Islam thinking in the party. <strong>Yusuf</strong> brushed aside these suggestions.</p> <p>He said that he resigned because he was exhausted and that, although he described Pochin’s question as “dumb”, that was a mistake and that Pochin was a “brilliant” MP. The word just referred to the question, not her, he stressed.</p> <p>Asked if he was comfortable about the picture of her holding the anti-Stamer mug, he replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think Sarah is an incredible MP question …</p> <p>Look, what I will say is, if we’re going to talk about Islam in the UK, to the degree that there is resentment building up about some of these issues, it is in no small part because it is my view that certain communities in this country are subject to two-tier policing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked again if he was comfortable with Pochin using a picture of a Muslim head covering to attack Starmer, Yusuf said he was comfortable with this because he knows Pochin well. She was laughing in the picture, he said.</p> <p>Asked if it suggested “a pretty unpleasant” attitude to Muslims, Yusuf said he did not accept that. He said that Pochin had been a magistrate for two decades, that he know who she was and “what’s in her heart”, and that some of the things said about the picture were “complete mischaracterisations”.</p> <p>Yusuf also said that, although he was “uneasy” about the idea of banning the burqa, he thought that, if he were an MP he “probably would be in favour” of the idea.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-09T10:22:02.424Z">at 11.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6846a8498f0811b259295028" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-09T09:30:24.446Z">10.30am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Mayor concerned about 'anti-London' slant in spending review, with Treasury expected to shelve some proposals for capital</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Sadiq Khan</strong>, the Labour mayor of London, is unhappy about what is on offer to the capital in the spending review, my colleague <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong> reports.

The government says this tool, developed using Google DeepMind’s Gemini model, will free up thousands of hours of officers’ time.</p> <p>In a news release, <strong>Downing Street</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>For the first time, this cutting-edge technology will help councils convert decades-old, handwritten planning documents and maps into data in minutes – and will power new types of planning software to slash the 250,000 estimated hours spent by planning officers each year manually checking these documents. This will dramatically reduce delays that have long plagued the system.</p> <p>Around 350,000 planning applications are submitted a year in England, yet the system remains heavily reliant on paper documents – some hundreds of pages long. Once submitted, each of these documents needs to be manually validated and approved by a planning officer. </p> <p>In test trials across Hillingdon, Nuneaton &amp; Bedworth, and Exeter councils, Extract digitised planning records, including maps, in just three minutes each – compared to the 1–2 hours it typically takes manually. This means Extract could process around 100 planning records a day – significantly speeding up the process.</p> <p>This represents a step-change in productivity, freeing up thousands of hours for planning officers to focus on decision-making to speed up housebuilding. It will also accelerate the delivery of much-needed housing, improve reliability in the planning process and reduce costs and save time for councils and developers. </p> <p>Extract is expected to be made available to all councils by spring 2026. The government’s ambition is to fully digitise the planning system - making it faster, more transparent, and easier to navigate for working people, councils, businesses and developers. </p> </blockquote> <p>For Starmer, this is familiar territory. As director of public prosecutions, one of his achivements he talks about most was digitalising court records.</p> <p>Starmer also confirmed<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-launches-national-skills-drive-to-unlock-opportunities-for-young-people-in-tech"> a £187m programme to extend AI teaching in schools.</a></p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-684684b38f08edac2d86afab" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-09T08:32:22.206Z">9.32am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Minister says spending review will mark ‘end to austerity’, as Home Office yet to agree deal</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Good morning. In theory spending review negotiations can go up to the wire, with the final talks to resolve sticking points taking place late at night, only hours before the decisions, and documents, are presented to MPs. In practice, it does not really happen like that now, last-minute haggling is no longer routine, and, with two days to go before the spending review that will settle government spending until 2029, only one cabinet minister has not yet settled.</p> <p>Here are the key developments this morning on the issue that will dominate the week.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, settled with the Treasury late last night. </strong>The news was broken by <strong>Arj Singh</strong> from the i, <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/rayner-and-reeves-reach-eleventh-hour-truce-in-spending-battle-3737844?ito=twitter_share_article-top">who reports</a>:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The i Paper understands that Rayner and Reeves agreed a deal just after 7.30pm after marathon talks on Sunday.</p> <p>But Home Office and Treasury sources were tight lipped on Sunday, in an indication that negotiations over police funding are also going to the wire.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>That means Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is the only minister yet to agree a spending settlement with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.</strong> In the Times <strong>Chris Smyth</strong> says police budgets are expected to rise by more than inflation, but other parts of the Home Office budget may face cuts. He <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/police-to-get-spending-review-cash-boost-to-fight-crime-89dp63nbz">reports</a>:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is understood that Reeves has insisted that policing budgets will rise in each year of the spending review, which sets funding up to 2028-29. However, it remains unclear if the boost will match the more than £1 billion extra officers say is needed to cover existing shortfalls.</p> <p>Cooper is also expected to have to find deeper cuts elsewhere to boost police budgets. The Border Force has warned of longer queues at airports as it faces cuts to its £1.2 billion budget, saying there would be a “threat to national security” if it lost frontline staff.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Two police unions have launched a last-minute bid for extra money.</strong> In<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/06/08/policing-is-broken-officers-warn-reeves/"> an article in the Daily Telegraph</a>, Nick Smart, president of the <strong>Police Superintendents’s Association</strong>, and Tiff Lynch, acting chairman of the <strong>Police Federation of England and Wales</strong>, say:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Police are being asked to do more with less – again – as pressure mounts on already overstretched budgets.</p> <p>Why? Policing faces a £1.2 billion shortfall. This is before it is asked to deliver the ambitious pledges of the new government.</p> <p>Police forces across the country are being forced to shed officers and staff to deliver savings.</p> <p>These are not administrative cuts. They go to the core of policing’s ability to deliver a quality service: fewer officers on the beat, longer wait times for victims, and less available officers when a crisis hits.</p> </blockquote> <p>As a practical lobbying exercise, this is fairly pointless, because it comes too late, but the two unions are making their case to the public.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Chris Bryant, the culture minister, has said that the spending review will mark “an end to austerity”.</strong> He told Times Radio:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We know from running the government that spending money of itself isn’t an achievement. Spending money and getting results is an achievement and that’s why we are saying now with this spending review on Wednesday it’s an end to austerity …</p> <p>That period of austerity where I think previous governments simply cut all public service budgets just because they believed that was what you had to do is over.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he also said some budgets would be “stretched”. He said health and defence spending would rise, but added:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There are going to be other parts of the budget that are going to be much more stretched and be difficult.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ministers have been promising the end of austerity at least since Theresa May was in office. Labour defends using this phrase on the grounds that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/20/conservatives-local-elections-kemi-badenoch-keir-starmer-labour-uk-politics-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-67dc14fe8f0837956aaeb261#block-67dc14fe8f0837956aaeb261">overall government spending is going up in real terms</a>. But there is no agreed definition of “austerity” and, if spending is falling in certain areas, that may feel like austerity, and so using the term does not contribute a lot to public debate. What it does mean, though, is that governments saying they are ending austerity definitely don’t want to be associated with George Osborne.</p> <p>Here is our overnight story about the spending review.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/08/rachel-reeves-in-stand-off-over-policing-and-council-budgets-days-before-spending-review">Rachel Reeves in standoff over policing and council budgets days before spending review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>Morning:</em> Keir Starmer gives a speech at a London Tech Week event.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>Noon:</em> Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, gives a speech at Port Talbot in south Wales.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p>Also, Starmer is meeting Mark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, in Downing Street today.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me on social media.
