<p>The cost of government debt payments in the world’s richest nations last year reached its highest level since 2007, outstripping the amount spent on defence, police services and housing, a report has found.</p> <p>Across the 38 members of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/oecd">the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> (OECD), debt service costs as a percentage of national income rose to 3.3% in 2024, from 2.4% in 2021.</p> <p>Most governments are under pressure to increase spending as the costs from the green transition, higher defence spending and ageing populations become more pressing.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/mar/20/bank-of-england-interest-rates-decision-economy-trade-war-wage-growth-slows-business-live">Bank of England leaves interest rates on hold despite ‘intensifying’ trade war uncertainty – business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Germany’s parliament this week approved a massive plan to boost infrastructure and support a broader European defence spending push. The UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is expected to preserve investment spending in her spring statement next week while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/18/liz-kendall-unveils-drastic-uk-benefits-cuts-to-fix-broken-system">cutting back day-to-day budgets</a> in response to higher debt servicing costs.</p> <p>According to the OECD’s <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/global-debt-report-2025_8ee42b13-en.html">Global Debt Report</a>, defence spending of 2.2% among member states fell well below the soaring cost of debt interest, while spending on housing was 0.7% of national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), and 1.7% on the police and public order.</p> <p>OECD governments raised $15.7tn (£12.1tn) in fresh borrowing in 2024, which amounted to $3tn of extra debt once repayments were included. That took the total amount of OECD government debt to $55tn. The stock of global sovereign debt reached $65.2tn after a small rise in non-OECD government borrowing.</p> <p>Corporate debt rose to $35tn – ratcheting up the level of total global debt to exceed $100tn – with much of the extra borrowing used by companies to fund share buy-backs and dividend payments to shareholders.</p> <p>The top five issuers – the US, Japan, France, Italy and the UK – accounted for more than 85% of gross borrowing in OECD countries in 2024. The US alone represented more than two-thirds of the total.</p> <p>The OECD secretary-general, Mathias Cormann, said a combination of higher costs and higher debt risks was restricting the capacity for future borrowing at a time of significant investment needs, “including to boost growth and productivity, respond to population ageing and address defence needs”.</p> <p>He said the high cost of borrowing was an incentive for governments to target “productivity enhancing public investment that enhances long-term growth”.</p> <p>The Paris-based group said debt levels are expected to rise further in 2025, with the average debt-to-GDP ratio in OECD countries reaching 85%, more than 10 points higher than in 2019 and nearly double the 2007 level.</p> <p>There are also concerns that a large proportion of pandemic-related borrowing will need to be refinanced at higher interest rates over the next two years.</p> <p>Nearly half of the government debt of OECD countries and emerging markets and about a third of corporate debt will mature by 2027.</p> <p>Low-income, high-risk countries face the greatest refinancing risks, with more than half of their debt maturing in the next three years and more than 20% of it this year, the organisation said.</p> <p>As debt becomes more costly, governments and companies need to ensure their borrowing supports long-term growth and productivity, according to the OECD head of capital markets and financial institutions, Serdar Çelik.</p> <p>“If they do it this way, we are not worried … If they don’t do it this way, if it adds additional, expensive debt, without increasing the productive capacity of the economy, then we will see more difficult times,” Çelik said.</p>
