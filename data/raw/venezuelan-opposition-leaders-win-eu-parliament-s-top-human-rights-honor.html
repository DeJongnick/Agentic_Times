<p>The European parliament has awarded its top human rights honor, the Sakharov prize for freedom of thought, to Venezuelan opposition leaders María Corina Machado and Edmundo González for “representing the people of Venezuela fighting to restore freedom and democracy”.</p> <p>Machado was set to run as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/21/venezuela-oppostion-election-2024-nicolas-maduro-maria-corina-machado">democratic opposition candidate</a> against the incumbent president, Nicolás Maduro, in Venezuela’s contested 2024 election, but she was disqualified by the government, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/04/venezuela-election-polls-maduro">so González took her place.</a> He had never run for office before the presidential election.</p> <p>The lead-up to the poll saw widespread repression, including disqualifications, arrests and human rights violations. Machado went into hiding, fearing for her life. A Venezuelan court issued an arrest warrant for González, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/08/venezuela-opposition-leader-edmundo-gonzalez-reportedly-leaves-country-for-spain">who claimed political asylum in Spain</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/06/venezuelas-opposition-leader-calls-for-global-movement-to-rescue-country">Venezuela’s opposition leader calls for global movement to ‘rescue’ country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“In their quest for a fair, free and peaceful transition of power, they have fearlessly upheld values that millions of Venezuelans and the European parliament hold so dear: justice, democracy and the rule of law,” Roberta Metsola, president of the European parliament, told EU lawmakers.</p> <p>“This parliament stands with the people of Venezuela and with María and Edmundo in their struggle for the democratic future of their country,” she added. “We are confident that Venezeula and democracy will ultimately prevail.”</p> <p>Machado’s group maintains that it has evidence that González won the 28 July presidential election by a wide margin, despite Maduro’s claim to have won.</p> <p>Maduro’s victory was contested by independent observers, including the United Nations.
