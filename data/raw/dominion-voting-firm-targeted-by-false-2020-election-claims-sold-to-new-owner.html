<p>Dominion Voting Systems, the company that makes widely used voting equipment in the United States that became <a href="https://www.dominionvoting.com/setting-the-record-straight-election-2020-2022-2024/">synonymous with election conspiracies</a> and Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election, has been sold.</p> <p>The company was purchased by Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican Missouri election official who founded KnowInk, which makes electronic pollbooks used at voting sites across the country. Leiendecker purchased Dominion under a new company called Liberty Vote. Leiendecker served as the elections director in St Louis from 2005 until 2012, according to his LinkedIn, a period during which he would have overlapped with Ed Martin, a staunch Trump ally at the justice department who served as chairman of the St Louis board of elections from 2005 to 2006.</p> <p>Leiendecker said in a press release the acquisition represented “a new chapter for American elections – one where trust is rebuilt from the ground up”, pledging to deliver election technology that prioritized “paper-based transparency, security, and simplicity so that voters can be assured that every ballot is filled-in accurately and fairly counted”.</p> <p>“As of today, Dominion is gone. Liberty Vote assumes full ownership and operational control,” the company said in a statement.</p> <p>The sale comes after Dominion spent years in court defending its reputation and pursuing damages against news outlets and Trump allies who baselessly said the company’s equipment had flipped votes in 2020. In 2023, it reached a landmark <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/18/fox-dominion-settle-us-defamation-lawsuit">$787.5m settlement</a> with Fox over false claims about the election. The private equity firm Staple Street capital bought a 76% stake in Dominion for $38m in 2018.</p> <p>Newsmax, another far-right network, agreed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/newsmax-election-lies-dominion-settlement">to pay $67m</a> to settle a libel lawsuit against Dominion earlier this year. Dominion has also reached settlements with <a href="https://x.com/JordanOnRecord/status/1974230483954171931">One America News</a>, Sidney Powell and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/28/rudy-giuliani-dominion-settle-election-lawsuit">Rudy Giuliani</a> over false claims over the 2020 election.</p> <p>Dominion was founded and headquartered in Toronto, and also operated from Denver, Colorado. The company developed software in offices across the United States, Canada and Serbia. Its systems were used in over half the United States during the 2024 election.</p> <p>Financial terms of the sale were not disclosed.</p> <p>The newly renamed Liberty Vote said it would use hand-marked paper ballots, maintain 100% American ownership with domestic staffing and software development, and implement rigorous third-party auditing standards.</p> <p>The company said its approach would ensure “compliance with President Trump’s executive order” on election security, though specific details were not provided. A 25 March executive order demands states to use voting systems that have a “voter verifiable paper record” (every state except Louisiana already uses paper ballots and paper records, according to the non-profit Verified Voting). The order also seeks to ban equipment in which a voter’s choices are encoded in a QR code.</p> <p>KnowInk is “highly regarded” in the election community, said Jennifer Morrell, CEO of the elections group and a widely respected election administration consultant.</p> <p>“I’m confident they would not be buying Dominion if there was any possibility they could not offer the same great services and support that they currently provide election officials with their e-pollbook and voter registration systems,” she said.</p>
