Marks expects the number of prosecutions to rise in coming years, as HMRC is also investing in artificial intelligence, and is already using predictive analytics and machine learning to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share of tax.</p> <p><strong>Nesil</strong> <strong>Caliskan</strong>, another Labour MP, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“I have constituents living in Barking who are… paying housing charges going to a company owned by individuals living in offshore tax havens, they’re getting ripped off.

This, on the face of it, looks like a large funding increase and has been reported by some as such.</p> <p>However, it doesn’t look to be. This is because after the UK left the EU, farmers were promised that their subsidies would be the same as they were under the EU, and were promised a figure of £2.4bn a year.</p> <p>The Tory government at the time decided that rather than being paid per acre, farmers should be paid for improving nature so devised the ELMS schemes, but while these got up and running the acreage payments known as Basic Payments Schemes (BPS) were kept. These would be cut each year as the ELMS increased and are due to be phased out entirely by 2028.</p> <p>So, farmers currently get the £2.4bn a year in two streams - the ELMS and the BPS - as well as a smaller amount of money in grants for things like robotics trials.</p> <p>By 2028/29 they will not be paid BPS so will only get ELMS and this will have a value of £2bn. There may be some other grants available to top this up, but this has not been confirmed.</p> <p>In reality, the government has promised an average of £2.3bn a year up to 2028/29 for the farming budget, which is a £100m a year cut, and by the end of the spending period it looks like the budget shrinks to not much more than £2bn.</p> <p><strong>NFU</strong> senior economist <strong>Sanjay</strong> <strong>Dhanda</strong> has said Defra has been “misleading” in its claims.</p> <p>He said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“A key pillar of Defra’s budget is the continued investment in ELMs, with funding set to rise to £2 billion by 2028/29 compared to the £1.8 billion earmarked in the Autumn 2024 budget. While the government has framed this as a significant uplift from the £800 million spent in 2023/24, this comparison is misleading as ELMs was not fully operational at that point, and de-linked payments (BPS) absorbed a large share of funding.</p> <p>“The actual increase is a modest £200 million over four years – barely sufficient to keep pace with inflation, let alone scale up delivery.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-684aa4948f0814dfee5fe716" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-12T10:01:22.374Z">11.01am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">UK trade deficit widens....</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The tumble in exports to the US in April helped to widen the UK’s trade deficit.</strong></p> <p>In April alone, UK goods exports fell by £2.7bn – of which £2bn was the decline in sales to the US, plus a £600m drop in exports to the EU.</p> <p>Overall, the UK’s trade in goods deficit widened by £4.4bn to £60.0bn in the February-April quarter.</p> <p>That more than surpassed the services sector’s surplus, which fell by £500m to £48.5bn over the quarter.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/ONS/status/1933042322553647141">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The total underlying trade deficit widened £4.9bn to £11.5bn in the 3 months to April 2025, because of a larger rise in imports than exports. <a href="https://t.co/V8uNGPjGHe">pic.twitter.com/V8uNGPjGHe</a></p>&mdash; Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) <a href="https://twitter.com/ONS/status/1933042322553647141?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2025</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-12T10:14:39.990Z">at 11.14am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-684a98978f08c87de84dc922" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/joanna-partridge"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-12T09:07:03.340Z">10.07am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>In the travel sector, disruptive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair">Ryanair</a> passengers whose behaviour results in them being removed from the plane will be fined £500.</strong></p> <p>Europe’s biggest airline said this would be the “minimum” punishment and that it would continue to pursue ejected passengers for civil damages.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/12/ryanair-fines-disruptive-passengers-kicked-off-flights">Ryanair to issue £500 fines to disruptive passengers who are kicked off flights</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-684a8d188f0814dfee5fe62d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-12T08:25:25.243Z">9.25am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">European markets fall amid new trade tensions</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>This morning’s disappointing UK growth, and trade, data hasn’t caused a panic in the City.</strong></p> <p>The <strong>FTSE</strong> <strong>100</strong> share index has dipped by just 9 points, or 0.1%, to 8855 points, having ended Wednesday near its closing high.</p> <p>Other European markets are having a rather worse morning; Germany’s <strong>DAX</strong> index has dropped by 1.35%, while France’s <strong>CAC</strong> is down 1%.</p> <p>Trade war fears are, again, rippling across trading floors, even though the US and China patched up their truce yesterday.</p> <p>President <strong>Donald</strong> <strong>Trump</strong> has alarmed investors by revealing yesterday tht he plans to send letters to trading partners in the next couple of weeks setting unilateral tariff rates</p> <p><strong>Trump</strong> told reporters Wednesday at the John F.

Such swings in transaction around stamp duty changes are by no means unusual in the UK housing market: there were precedents around, for example, the end of the pandemic ‘stamp duty holiday’. This affected conveyancing solicitors as well as real estate agencies’ output negatively in April. Indeed, legal activities saw their output plunge by 10.2% on the month, having experienced a 4.1% jump in March, and ‘real estate activities on a fee or contract basis’ witnessed a 6.5% drop after a 1.8% increase in March. These two swings together sliced off 0.19%pts from monthly GDP in April, as per our calculations, and so therefore explain the bulk of its fall.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The second, of course, is that ahead of ‘Liberation Day’, the timing of which the US administration had pre-announced in February, companies had brought forward production and exports to the US market that would otherwise have taken place later on.</strong> <br></p></li> </ul> <p>A fall in production in April is therefore, to some extent, payback. An example for this is likely to be the car industry: the output of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers fell by 9.5% in April, having jumped by 7.4% in March. This subtracted a further 0.07%pts from monthly GDP, we calculate. Whereas this may not have been solely due to front-running to the US – the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also reported model changeovers to have contributed, for instance – this seems likely to be have been an important factor.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-12T09:58:32.923Z">at 10.58am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-684a884d8f089bbac352e589" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-12T07:59:29.476Z">8.59am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">ING: Shrinking economy is headache for Reeves</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The sharper-than-forecast slide in UK GDP in April is a “headache” for chancellor Rachel Reeves, reports <strong>ING’s</strong> Developed Markets Economist, <strong>James Smith.</strong></p> <p><strong>Smith</strong> says April was a disappointing month for the UK economy, partly because manufacturing surged earlier in the year as customers tried to avoid Donald Trump’s tariffs, leading to a fallback once they were announced.</p> <p>He adds:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Yesterday’s spending review – an exercise which divvies out budgets across government departments – carried few surprises.

By the end of the decade (2028-29), the health service will account for half (49 per cent) of all day-to-day public service spending controlled by Westminster – up from a third (34 per cent) in 2009-10.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/resfoundation/status/1932910537991467210">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The NHS has again grabbed the lion’s share (90 per cent) of the extra funding for day-to-day public services allocated at the Spending Review,.<br><br>Spending on the rest of day-to-day public services will fall slightly (by 1.3 per cent on average) in real, per-person terms by the end… <a href="https://t.co/mnwzagCrQr">pic.twitter.com/mnwzagCrQr</a></p>&mdash; Resolution Foundation (@resfoundation) <a href="https://twitter.com/resfoundation/status/1932910537991467210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><strong>…and shrunken public services elsewhere.</strong> While real, per-person funding for health has increased by 36 per cent between 2009-10 and 2028-29, it has fallen by 16 per cent for Justice, 31 per cent for Work and Pensions, and 50 per cent for Housing, Communities and Local Government over the same period.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Defence dominates infrastructure plans while total non-defence investment sees cuts. </strong>The £9.7 billion a year increase in capital spending between 2025-26 and 2029-30 includes an increase of £5.9 billion of financial transactions (primarily loans), with around two-fifths of the Warm Homes Plan now being funded by loans rather grants. Once these financial transactions are stripped out, the £7.4 billion a year increase in defence contrasts sharply with the £3.6 billion cut to real investment across all other departments.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The rise, fall and rise again of public service spending. </strong>Real day-to-day spending is now rising again in the 2020s (2019-20 to 2028-29) by 2.2 per cent a year, following a 0.5 per cent fall per year in the 2010s (2009-10 to 2019-20). In the decade prior to that, spending rose by 4.3 on average each year (2001-02 to 2009-10).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lower-income families get a benefits-in-kind boost.</strong> The extra funding for hospitals, schools and the police relative to plans set out by the previous Government will deliver important benefits-in-kind to families. The Foundation estimates that a middle-income household will gain £1,400 on average for extra public service provision (in 2028-29), rising to £1,7000 for the poorest fifth of families.</p></li> <li><p><strong>From a summer of spending to another autumn of tax rises?</strong> The large increase in public spending has been funded in large part by the £39.7 billion of tax rises (in 2028-29) announced in the Budget last Autumn and £3.6 billion of benefit cuts (in 2028-29) announced in the Spring Statement – equivalent to £1,550 for every family in Britain. But the combination of a weaker economic outlook, an unfunded spending commitment on Winter Fuel Payments, and just £9.9 billion of headroom against the Chancellor’s fiscal rules, mean further tax rises are likely to be needed this autumn.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-12T06:37:33.560Z">at 7.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-684a69028f08c87de84dc7b4" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/hilaryosborne"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-12T05:46:45.984Z">6.46am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">House price surge over last 20 years, Zoopla report shows</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Data from Zoopla this morning has confirmed what we have all known for a while: house prices have rocketed over the past two decades. Figures from the listing site show the average price of a UK home has risen by 74% since 2005.</strong></p> <p>Its analysis of the cost of homes found the average price had gone from £154,300 in April 2005 to £268,200 in the same month of this year.</p> <p>Although for a while wage increases lagged house prices, <strong>Zoopla</strong> said over the 20-year period price to earnings ratios had remained broadly the same, with properties changing hands for 6.4 times incomes.</p> <p>However, the headline figures disguise big differences around the UK. In the south London borough Merton, <strong>Zoopla</strong> said prices increased by 147% over the period, from £228,600 to £563,800 – this was the biggest percentage increase in the country. In cash terms, the biggest rise was also in London, this time in Kensington &amp; Chelsea – where the average price increased by 124% over the period, from £504,000 to £1.13m.</p> <p>London boroughs took up 18 of the top 20 spots and seven recorded price growth of more than 130%. Spelthorne in Surrey was the first place outside London, with an increase of 112% from £206,800 to £439,100.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum were several areas in the north of England which recorded growth of just 22%. In Sunderland, prices were up by 22%, going from £101,600 to £124,000.
