<p>Hurricane Dorian is thought to have been one of the worst natural disasters for the Bahamas, leaving at least 70,000 people homeless and causing more than $5bn (£3.7bn)<em><strong> </strong></em>in damage in 2019. But it wasn’t just people who suffered. For one forest dwelling songbird – the Bahama nuthatch – this hurricane <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bird-conservation-international/article/gone-with-the-wind-the-proximate-and-ultimate-causes-of-the-decline-and-extinction-of-the-bahama-nuthatch-sitta-insularis/4F0B80C6964CDAC1B69F6EA8F9D2CB8B?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=bookmark">spelled the end</a>.</p> <p>Now a new study reveals that a significant number of species that are endemic to a single island, like the Bahama nuthatch, are at increasing risk of extinction from severe tropical cyclones, with an <a href="https://theconversation.com/for-many-island-species-the-next-tropical-cyclone-may-be-their-last-256600">estimated 60 species potentially one cyclone away</a> from being wiped out.</p> <p>Researchers mapped all the severe cyclones (those with wind speeds above 200km/h) that have occurred since 1972 and worked out how many of these had hit biodiversity hotspots. To their surprise, they found three-quarters of severe cyclones struck biodiversity hotspots made up entirely of islands and 95% of these repeatedly pummelled the same five island regions: Japan, Polynesia-Micronesia, the Philippines, Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands, and the Caribbean islands.</p> <p>Consulting the red list of most threatened species they report in the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320725002216">Biological Conservation</a> there are 60 storm-threatened species that are present in a single location on a single island. Upping the conservation effort for these species is essential if we do not want the next severe tropical cyclone to be their last.</p>
