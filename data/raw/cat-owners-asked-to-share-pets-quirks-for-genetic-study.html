<p>Cat owners are being asked share their pet’s quirky traits and even post researchers their fur in an effort to shed light on how cats’ health and behaviour are influenced by their genetics.</p> <p>The scientists behind the project, <a href="https://cats.darwinsark.org/login?callbackUrl=%2Flaboratory">Darwin’s Cats</a>, are hoping to enrol 100,000 felines, from pedigrees to moggies, with the DNA of 5,000 cats expected to be sequenced in the next year.</p> <p>The team say the goal is to produce the world’s largest feline genetic database.</p> <p>“Unlike most existing databases, which tend to focus on specific breeds or veterinary applications, Darwin’s Cats is building a diverse, large-scale dataset that includes pet cats, strays and mixed breeds from all walks of life,” said Dr Elinor Karlsson, the chief scientist at the US nonprofit organisation Darwin’s Ark, director of the vertebrate genomics group at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and associate professor at the UMass Chan medical school.</p> <p>“It’s important to note, this is an open data project, so we will share the data with other scientists as the dataset grows,” she added.</p> <p>The project follows on the heels of <a href="https://darwinsark.org/category/darwins-dogs">Darwin’s Dogs</a>, a similar endeavour that has <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk0639">shed light on aspects of canine behaviour</a>, disease and the genetic origins of modern breeds.</p> <p>Darwin’s Cats was launched in mid-2024 and already has more than 3,000 cats enrolled, although not all have submitted fur samples.</p> <p>Participants from all parts of the world are asked to complete a number of free surveys about their pet’s physical traits, behaviour, environment, and health.</p> <p>However, at present, DNA kits – for owners to submit fur samples – can be sent only to US residents, and a donation of $150 (£120) for one cat is requested to cover the cost of sequencing and help fund the research.</p> <p>Karlsson added the team had developed a method to obtain high-quality DNA from loose fur without needing its roots – meaning samples can simply be collected by brushing.</p> <p>The researchers hope that by combining insights from cats’ DNA with the survey results they can shed light on how feline genetics influences what cats look like, how they act and the diseases they experience.</p> <p>“Understanding the genetics behind personality traits could even shed light on human neurodevelopmental conditions,” said Karlsson.</p> <p>The team also hopes to learn more about the genetic diversity of different breeds and unpick the ancestry of modern cats, with Karlsson adding she is particularly interested in many-toed cats.</p> <p>“I’m really curious to find out how common this trait is in different parts of the world. I hope one day we might be able to combine that information with genetics to trace this trait back to its origins,” she said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the charity International Cat Care (iCatCare), which is not involved in the work, said: “We’re really interested in the collaborative approach of Darwin’s Ark, particularly in encouraging pet owners as community scientists to help advance the collective scientific understanding of cats as a species.”</p> <p>Dr Jeffrey Schoenebeck, of the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, also welcomed the scheme. “This is an important project that has the potential to improve our understanding of companion animals, the diseases that cause their morbidities, and the very nature of feline domestication,” he said.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 19 March 2025. The donation amount requested by Darwin’s Cats for sequencing is $150, not $199 as stated in an earlier version due to incorrect information being provided.</p>
