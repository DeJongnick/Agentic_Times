She will remain at the Premiership Women’s Rugby club Loughborough as an assistant coach and she will take on a specialist coaching and mentoring role with the Rugby Football Union this season.</p> <p>“It’s been the greatest privilege to wear the England shirt and to represent my country for so many years,” Scarratt said. “Rugby has given me everything; incredible teammates, memories, and experiences I’ll carry with me forever.</p> <p>“I still love the game, but the time feels right to step away. You don’t always get the chance in sport to make that decision for yourself, and I feel so lucky to do so on my own terms, proud of everything I’ve been part of.</p> <p>“From my first cap in 2008 to walking out in front of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/27/england-outclass-canada-to-capture-glorious-womens-rugby-world-cup-triumph">more than 80,000 people at a World Cup final</a>, the journey has been incredible. To have witnessed and played a part in the transformation of women’s rugby from amateur to professional is something I’m immensely proud of.”</p> <p>Scarratt is the Red Roses’ all-time top points-scorer with 754 and is the third-highest on their lists of caps and try-scorers. In 2019 she was named World Rugby player of the year.</p> <p>Scarratt also excelled at sevens, representing Great Britain and captaining the team at the 2016 Rio Olympics where they finished fourth. She also won a Commonwealth Games bronze medal with England sevens in 2018.</p> <p>At the 2014 Rugby World Cup Scarratt was named the player of the final and she was the top points-scorer throughout the tournament with 70. In the 2025 World Cup she made one appearance, coming off of the bench <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/22/england-off-to-a-flier-in-11-try-womens-rugby-world-cup-mauling-of-usa">against USA in the tournament opener.</a></p> <p>Scarratt thanked her family, coaches, teammates and fans for their support throughout her career and said: “While it’s the right moment to stop playing, I’m really excited to stay involved with the RFU and to help shape the future of the game. The women’s game is in an amazing place, and I’m proud to still be part of its journey.”</p> <p>John Mitchell, the England head coach, said of Scarratt: “Emily is a once in a generation player. Her quality, her calmness under pressure, and her ability to lead by example set the standard for everyone around her.</p> <p>“There was no better example of this than the role she played during the recent World Cup, where she added immense value off the field, despite not playing as much as she might have hoped for – that is just the kind of special person that she is.</p> <p>“She’s had a huge impact on the Red Roses and on women’s rugby globally, and we’re thrilled she’ll continue to share that experience through a different role.”</p>
