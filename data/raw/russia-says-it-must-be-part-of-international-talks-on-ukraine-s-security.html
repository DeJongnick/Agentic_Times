<p>Moscow has said it must be part of any international talks on Ukraine’s security, as Russia continues to stall on Donald Trump’s push for a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p> <p>Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Wednesday that Moscow must be included in any talks on Ukraine’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/what-security-guarantees-might-ukraine-get-in-return-for-a-peace-deal">security guarantees</a>, dismissing European diplomacy as “aggressive escalation” and a “clumsy effort to sway Trump”.</p> <p>“To discuss security guarantees seriously without Russia is a road to nowhere,” Lavrov said during a working visit to Jordan.</p> <p>Lavrov also said that China, Russia’s ally in the war, should be among Ukraine’s security guarantors – reviving a proposal first put forward by Russian negotiators during talks in Turkey in spring 2022.</p> <p>European leaders have begun exploring post-conflict security guarantees for Ukraine, following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump">Trump’s pledge</a> to help protect the country under any deal to end Russia’s war.</p> <p>Russian officials have repeatedly said Moscow would not accept the deployment of European forces to Ukraine, one of the key security guarantees under discussion.</p> <p>Kyiv is likely to view with scepticism any prospect of China, a supporter of Russia during the war, acting as a security guarantor.</p> <p>Lavrov, meanwhile, avoided any direct reference to a possible Putin-Zelenskyy summit, highlighting the Kremlin’s apparent plans to delay any concrete planning of a meeting.</p> <aside class="element

tread carefully amid hyped up expectations of breakthrough</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump announced this week he had “begun the arrangements” for the first meeting between the two leaders since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion.</p> <p>Trump later claimed he had set up a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, explaining: “I thought I’d first let them meet.”</p> <p>Opening direct talks with Zelenskyy would cut against the storyline Putin has cultivated since the 2022 invasion – portraying Ukraine’s president as an illegitimate figure and a mere puppet of the west.</p> <p>Putin, who almost never refers to Zelenskyy by name and instead speaks of the “Kyiv regime”, has repeatedly cast doubt on whether his Ukrainian counterpart even holds the authority to sign a peace agreement. “You can negotiate with anyone, but because of his illegitimacy, he [Zelenskyy] has no right to sign anything,” Putin told Russian officials earlier this year.</p> <p>But Trump’s promise of a meeting puts Putin in a difficult spot: rejecting it risks tension with the US president, while agreeing to one would elevate Zelenskyy to equal status and confront Putin with a media-savvy rival ready to meet almost without preconditions.</p> <p>Moscow has shown scant sign of preparing for such an encounter.</p> <p>Lavrov cautioned on Wednesday that any contact between the two leaders would need to be arranged “with the utmost care”, while other Russian officials dismissed Zelenskyy as a lightweight unworthy of serious attention.</p> <p>But, as often is the case, Moscow has avoided closing the door entirely, hinting that the Putin–Zelenskyy encounter could take place, while giving no sign that it is actually on the horizon.</p> <p><a

Putin-Zelenskyy meeting, including the Vatican, Switzerland and Hungary.</p> <p>The Russian leader reportedly suggested to Trump that his counterpart travel to Moscow for talks – an idea Russia knew Kyiv would reject because of the obvious risks to Zelenskyy’s safety.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Tassinari</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Analysts suggested that the Russian leader would probably only meet Zelenskyy to accept Russia’s maximalist conditions, which would equal Ukraine’s capitulation.</p> <p>“Putin will not meet Zelenskyy under the current circumstances,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “He has repeatedly stated that such a meeting would only be possible if there were well-prepared grounds, which in practice means Zelenskyy’s acceptance of Russia’s terms for ending the war.”</p> <p>Figures close to the Kremlin have emphasised that Putin sees no need to rush into a meeting with Zelenskyy.</p> <p>“Simply put, Putin only sees value in a meeting with Zelenskyy if it ends with a capitulation,” wrote the nationalist commentator Alexei Mukhin. “If Zelenskyy is unwilling to sign one, the Kremlin will keep ‘working on’ the idea of a meeting until he is,” Mukhin added.</p> <p>Putin now faces a situation reminiscent of earlier moments when Trump pressed him to agree to a ceasefire. At the time, he managed to manoeuvre around the pressure, and analysts believe he is likely to take a similar approach now – downplaying the prospect of talks without rejecting them outright.</p> <p>The key question is whether Trump will seek to put pressure on Kyiv to accept some of Russia’s demands to clear the way for a meeting between the two leaders.</p> <p>Russia’s leadership on Wednesday showed no sign of compromise. Lavrov said the US was beginning to gain a clearer understanding of the “root causes” of the war – a phrase Putin has used to describe demands ranging from Ukraine’s formal renunciation of Nato membership to its “demilitarisation” and “denazification”, a vague formula that in practice would mean removing Zelenskyy.</p> <p>The Russian foreign minister also pointed to the April 2022 talks in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine as a model. Those failed negotiations centred on Moscow’s demands for Ukraine’s disarmament, political neutrality and the abandonment of its ambition to join Nato.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Russian officials told Reuters that Moscow was preparing to raise taxes and cut spending to sustain high defence outlays and keep the war effort going.</p>
